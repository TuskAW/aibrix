The Hero\u2019s Journey is a structure that has been followed by some of the greatest stories ever told and ever lived.\n\nThe version of this journey described throughout the document is tailored for Kadence and is meant to serve as a reference point and a workspace for ideas, planning, and the execution of specialized tactics in order to continuously develop and progress the story which underlies the public representation of the ideas covered in this document.\n\nThe Journey, its associated ambitions, milestones, challenges, and gimmicks are experimental in nature, and thus are used to further our own research into the business of artist development, and quite possible leaving our mark on the World.\n\n## \\*\\*What is within this document?\\*\\*\n\nThis document contains a whole lot of useful information about characters, possible pathways of progression, theoretical understandings from The Hero\u2019s Journey, and much more. Overall, this document is a collection of all types of information that is relevant to the project undertakings described above.\n\n## \\*\\*How should this document be used?\\*\\*\n\nThis document should be seen strictly as an experimental guideline line used to plan and execute experimental content and plot lines with the intent of learning from experiment results and making changes to procedures in the future where necessary. With regards to content, the content database provided in this document will be used to visualize the potential timeline of events that will transpire once the official process has gone underway (ie. when the first piece of planned content is released to the public and the timeline must be adhered to.)\n\nIn addition to the content calendar, the document will be the gathering place for information deemed useful during the planning and execution process of projects such as the Docu-Series. This information serves to fuel the end-user content that is scheduled and created. By using the Hero\u2019s Journey as a guideline, maximum impact can be gradually attained via meticulous planning and execution of ordered story elements once it is distilled into its relevant parts here inside this document.\n\n## \\*\\*What is The Story\\*\\*\n\nThe Story is a character arch guideline for the Docu-series that is derived from the content of this page. It occurs over a discrete time period, subtly growing in both complexity and depth. The point of using a story is simple, it allows us as the creators of content to understand what type of activities, emotions, themes, places, people, and other story elements to include in order to progress the story, in film format, from a clear beginning to a decisive end without relying on specific events or in real life occurrences that might be outside of our control. By determining the characters in the story, as well as their personalities, aspirations, fears, hopes, and desires, we will be able to translate the implied reality of those characters into practical actions and plot points that can be made in the real world to add a touch of fantasy-like takeaways to the project.\n\nBy taking the time to understand both the created characters and their real life counterparts, we ensure maximum compatibility with your (you reading this document) own personal journey, as well as the journey of the characters within the story. This allows us to create a seamless and coherent narrative that will captivate and engage our audience, while also providing a meaningful and impactful experience for everyone involved.\n\nIn order to fully realize the potential of this project and to bring [The Story] to life, it is important to have a clear understanding of the key elements of The Hero\u2019s Journey, as well as an understanding of the specific goals and objectives of the project. With this information in hand, we can begin to craft a unique and compelling story that will capture the hearts and minds of our audience.\n\n### The Journey Ahead\n\nAs we embark on this journey, it is important to remember that this is an experiment and that the path ahead may be uncertain. However, by using The Hero\u2019s Journey as our guide, we can be sure to make the most of every opportunity that comes our way. With careful planning and execution, we can turn this project into something truly special and leave a lasting impact on the world.\n\"\n\n What is the next portion I should write?"}]}

They can adjust the inputs to see how different scenarios might impact crop growth and yield. This can help farmers make informed decisions about planting and crop management practices, ultimately leading to higher yields and profitability."}]}
{"timestamp": 26, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 547, "Output Length": 29, "prompt": "1. Does the RESTRICT Act violate the First Amendment right to free speech?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act focuses on national security risks and user privacy concerns related to certain transactions and holdings involving information and communication technology products or services. It does not directly address freedom of speech. However, critics may argue that the Act's potential to restrict access to certain platforms, like TikTok, could infringe on the First Amendment right to free speech. While the Act itself does not ban individual use of these platforms, it could still limit access to them and therefore have an impact on free speech. Ultimately, it will be up to the courts to determine if any specific actions taken under the Act violate the First Amendment.\n\n1. Is the RESTRICT Act too broad in its scope?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act gives the Secretary of Commerce broad authority to review and potentially restrict certain transactions and holdings involving information and communication technology products or services. Some may argue that this authority is too broad and could potentially be abused or used to unfairly target certain entities or individuals. However, supporters of the Act argue that this broad authority is necessary to effectively address national security risks and user privacy concerns related to foreign-owned platforms and products.\n\n1. Could the RESTRICT Act negatively impact international relations?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act may have an impact on international relations, particularly with countries whose companies and platforms may be subject to review under the Act. Critics may argue that the Act could be seen as overly aggressive and could potentially strain relationships with foreign governments. However, supporters of the Act may argue that it is necessary to protect national security and that the potential impact on international relations is outweighed by the benefits of increased security.\n\n1. Could the RESTRICT Act be used to unfairly target certain countries or companies?\n\nCritics of the RESTRICT Act may argue that it could be used to unfairly target certain countries or companies, particularly those that are seen as political or economic rivals to the United States. However, supporters of the Act may argue that the focus is on national security and user privacy concerns, rather than political or economic motivations. Ultimately, it will be up to the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that any actions taken under the Act are based on legitimate concerns related to national security and user privacy.\n\n1. How will the RESTRICT Act impact the global tech industry?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act could potentially have a significant impact on the global tech industry, particularly if it leads to increased restrictions on foreign-owned platforms and products. This could lead to increased competition among domestic companies, as well as increased pressure on foreign companies to conform to US regulations. However, it could also lead to decreased innovation and collaboration among global tech companies, as they may become more hesitant to work with each other due to potential national security risks."}]}

Introduction\nIn England's countryside, there lived a young lass,\nWhose parents had passed, leaving her alone in a vast,\nEstate owned by her uncle, a man so austere,\nWho had no time for her, nor care to appear.\n\nMary was her name, and she felt quite alone,\nNo friends to play with, no one to call her own,\nBut one day while exploring, she found a surprise,\nA secret garden, hidden away from prying eyes.\n\n1. Discovery of the Garden\nThe garden was locked up, with a rusted old key,\nBut Mary was curious, she wanted to see,\nWhat was inside that garden, what lay beyond,\nSo she searched high and low, till she found the bond.\n\nAs she walked through the garden, she felt a strange thrill,\nSeeing flowers and trees that had been silent and still,\nFor years they had slept, but now they awoke,\nAnd Mary felt a stirring, a strange, joyous poke.\n\n1. Friendship with Dickon\nSoon, Mary met a boy, a farmer's son,\nHis name was Dickon, he was full of fun,\nHe showed her the ways of the garden, and how,\nTo plant, water, and care for each flower and bough.\n\nTogether they worked, till the garden was bright,\nWith colors so vivid, a truly wonderful sight,\nMary had found a friend, one that was true,\nSomeone who helped her, when she was feeling blue.\n\n1. The Transformation of the Garden\nOver time, the garden transformed, bloomed, and grew,\nMary and Dickon had done it, they knew what to do,\nThe garden was alive, with sounds and scents so rare,\nA place that was magical, beyond compare.\n\nThe garden became a symbol, of hope and of love,\nFor those who were hurting, who felt lost, who needed a shove,\nIt reminded them that with effort and care,\nThey too could grow something, that was lovely and fair.\n\n1. Conclusion\nMary had found something, beyond wealth or fame,\nA garden that grew, a friendship that came,\nFrom working together, and never giving up,\nEven when things seemed hard, like an empty cup.\n\nThe garden taught her, the value of life,\nAnd how even in sorrow, there's a chance to thrive,\nMary's journey was a lesson, for young and old,\nAbout the power of friendship, and the beauty that's told.\n\nMoral of the Story:\nThrough Mary's journey, we learn that friendship is key,\nTo growth, transformation, and living life fully,\nWith hard work and perseverance, anything's possible,\nA secret garden of love and hope, that's truly remarkable."}]}

After the subprocess completes, the response data is read from a file that the Python script writes to, and the file is deleted.

We use the `data` event of the first response to detect the end of the `<head>` section, then split the chunk into two parts: the `<head>` section and the rest of the HTML. We enqueue the `<head>` section and start streaming the rest of the HTML from the second response. We use a boolean variable `headDone` to keep track of whether we have already processed the `<head>` section.

{"timestamp": 491, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 649, "Output Length": 29, "prompt": "The Helpmates venture pitch seeks to capitalize on a rapidly aging population and their growing need for assistance services. The pitch identifies a favorable societal and regulatory context, which is crucial for any new venture to succeed (Gartner, 1988). Moreover, the pitch highlights a clear market and customer needs, providing a compelling value proposition that resonates with potential customers (Kuratko et al., 2015). However, the pitch also presents some weaknesses that must be addressed to enhance its potential for success.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the pitch is its alignment with the demographic shift in the population, which creates a favorable window of opportunity for the venture (Eisenman, 2013). By leveraging this trend, the founders can position Helpmates as a valuable service that addresses the unmet needs of an aging population. The pitch also demonstrates a strong understanding of the target market, which is crucial for identifying and addressing customer needs effectively (Zhao & Seibert, 2006). This understanding is reflected in the pitch's articulation of a clear value proposition that appeals to customers who are willing to pay for the services offered.\n\nDespite these strengths, the pitch falls short in several areas. First, the competitive dynamics of the industry are not adequately addressed, raising concerns about the venture's ability to differentiate itself from established players (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994). To mitigate this weakness, the founders should conduct a thorough competitive analysis, identifying potential threats and opportunities, and develop strategies to differentiate their offering (Markman & Baron, 2003).\n\nSecond, the financial strength of the opportunity remains unclear due to a lack of detailed information on revenue projections, cost structures, and funding plans (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Providing a comprehensive financial plan can help the founders make informed decisions about the venture's growth and development, and it can also instill confidence in potential investors. Further, a robust financial plan demonstrates the founders' understanding of the economic aspects of their venture, which is vital for its success (Garvin & Levesque, 2006).\n\nThird, the pitch's implementation plan appears overly optimistic, with limited attention paid to potential challenges and risks. The founders should develop a more detailed and realistic implementation plan that incorporates strategies for managing risks and overcoming the liabilities of newness and size (Moroz & Hindle, 2012). This plan should be grounded in evidence-based approaches and informed by relevant theories and frameworks, such as design thinking (Brown & Wyatt, 2010), lean startup principles (Review et al., 2018), and strategic renewal strategies (Binns et al., 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the Helpmates venture pitch presents several key strengths, including a favorable business context, a clear understanding of the target market, and a compelling value proposition. However, weaknesses related to competitive dynamics, financial strength, and implementation must be addressed for the venture to succeed. By incorporating relevant theories and frameworks, the founders can enhance their pitch and increase the likelihood of their venture's success.\n\nWord Count: 498 (excluding reference list)"}]}

Here's how it works:\n\n1. First, we define two lists: `chunk_sizes` contains the sizes of the chunks we want to create, including the sample sizes, and `sample_sizes` contains the sample sizes we want to use.\n2. We also define a list `sample_file_suffixes` that contains the suffixes to use for the sample chunk file names.\n3. We read in the CSV file using `csv.reader` and add each value to a set called `data`. This ensures that we have a unique set of values, and it also allows us to use the set method `difference_update` to remove values from the set as we generate sample and remaining chunks.\n4. For each sample size in `sample_sizes`, we create a sample of that size using the `random.sample` function and store it in a set called `sample`. We then use `difference_update` to remove the sample values from `data`.\n5. We write the sample to a JSON file with a file name based on the original CSV file name and the corresponding suffix from `sample_file_suffixes`.\n6. For each remaining chunk size in `chunk_sizes`, we create a chunk of that size using the `random.sample` function if the chunk size is less than 10000 (i.e., if it's a sample chunk), or we use the full `data` set if the chunk size is 10000 (i.e., if it's a remaining chunk).\n7. We use `difference_update` to remove the chunk values from `data`.\n8. We write the chunk to a JSON file with a file name based on the original CSV file name and the chunk number."}]}
{"timestamp": 567, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 609, "Output Length": 32, "prompt": "Erasure coding is a method of data protection and fault tolerance that involves breaking data into smaller pieces, adding redundant information, and distributing the data fragments across multiple storage locations. It is widely used in distributed systems, such as cloud storage, data centers, and in the case of Celestia, distributed blockchain networks. The primary goal of erasure coding is to ensure data reliability and availability even in the face of storage failures or data loss.\n\nHere's an in-depth description of erasure coding:\n\n1. Data Fragmentation: The original data is divided into smaller pieces, called data fragments or data shards. Each fragment contains a portion of the original data.\n2. Redundancy: Redundant fragments, called parity shards, are created by applying an algorithm, such as Reed-Solomon coding or another erasure coding scheme. Parity shards are generated using mathematical transformations or encoding functions that combine the original data shards. The number of parity shards depends on the desired level of fault tolerance and redundancy.\n3. Distribution: Both data shards and parity shards are distributed across multiple storage locations (e.g., storage nodes or disks). This distribution ensures that the data is spread across the system, reducing the impact of any single point of failure.\n4. Recovery: When data needs to be retrieved or reconstructed, a subset of the original data shards and parity shards is used. The recovery process involves decoding the available shards to regenerate the original data. As long as a sufficient number of shards (data shards and/or parity shards) are available, the original data can be reconstructed even if some of the storage locations have failed or become unavailable.\n5. Fault Tolerance: The level of fault tolerance provided by erasure coding depends on the ratio of data shards to parity shards. More parity shards result in greater fault tolerance, but at the cost of increased storage overhead. For example, with an erasure coding scheme that uses 10 data shards and 4 parity shards (often denoted as 10+4), the system can tolerate up to 4 storage failures or unavailable shards while still being able to recover the original data.\n\nErasure coding provides several benefits over traditional data replication methods, such as RAID or mirroring:\n\n* Storage Efficiency: Erasure coding generally requires less storage overhead than full replication while still providing a high level of fault tolerance.\n* Scalability: Erasure coding can be easily scaled to support large distributed systems, making it suitable for cloud storage, distributed file systems, and blockchain networks.\n* Reliability: By spreading data and parity shards across multiple storage locations, erasure coding reduces the likelihood of data loss or unavailability due to localized failures or storage issues.\n\nIn the context of Celestia, erasure coding is used to ensure data availability and fault tolerance for the transaction data submitted by rollups. By encoding and distributing the data across the network, Celestia can guarantee that the data is accessible and resilient to censorship or unavailability attacks, enabling secure and efficient data availability for rollups and other decentralized applications."}]}

You can use the @Entity and @Column annotations to map the fields of the object to the columns of the database table.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"request_data\")\npublic class RequestData {\n\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n  private Long id;\n\n  @Column(name = \"processor_id\")\n  private String processorId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"issuer_id\")\n  private String issuerId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"transaction_id\")\n  private String transactionId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"stepup_request_id\")\n  private String stepupRequestId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"device_locale\")\n  private String deviceLocale;\n\n  @Column(name = \"device_user_agent\")\n  private String deviceUserAgent;\n\n  @Column(name = \"message_version\")\n  private String messageVersion;\n\n  @Column(name = \"rdx_message_version\")\n  private String rdxMessageVersion;\n\n  @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n  @JoinColumn(name = \"payment_info_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\")\n  private PaymentInfo paymentInfo;\n\n  // Getters and setters\n}\n```\nNext, you can create a repository interface to handle the database operations. For example:\n```\npublic interface RequestDataRepository extends JpaRepository<RequestData, Long> {\n}\n```\nFinally, you can inject the RequestDataRepository bean into your API controller and use it to save the request data to the database.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@RestController\npublic class MyApiController {\n\n  @Autowired\n  private RequestDataRepository requestDataRepository;\n\n  @PostMapping(\"/api/request\")\n  public ResponseEntity<Object> processRequest(@RequestBody MyRequest request) {\n    // Step 02: Save the request to the database with status = 1\n    RequestData requestData = new RequestData();\n    requestData.setProcessorId(request.getProcessorId());\n    requestData.setIssuerId(request.getIssuerId());\n    requestData.setTransactionId(request.getTransactionId());\n    requestData.setStepupRequestId(request.getStepupRequestId());\n    requestData.setDeviceLocale(request.getDeviceLocale());\n    requestData.setDeviceUserAgent(request.getDeviceUserAgent());\n    requestData.setMessageVersion(request.getMessageVersion());\n    requestData.setRdxMessageVersion(request.getRdxMessageVersion());\n    requestData.setPaymentInfo(request.getPaymentInfo());\n    requestData.setStatus(1); // status = 1 indicates that the request has been received\n    requestDataRepository.save(requestData);\n  }\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!

The `arc` command takes three arguments: the start angle, the end angle, and the radius of the arc. Here, we specify the start angle as 0 (which corresponds to the positive x-axis), the end angle as 20 degrees, and the radius as 1 (which is arbitrary). The `node` command is used to add the angle label at the midpoint of the arc, using the `above right` option to position the label above and to the right of the arc, and the `midway` option to position the label at the midpoint of the arc. We use `$20^\\circ$` to typeset the degree symbol in LaTeX."}]}

His allergies were acting up, triggered by the spices and dust in the air, and he felt the telltale tickle in his nose.\n\nPhil, ever the jester, noticed Jack's discomfort and leaned over to whisper in his ear. \"You feeling alright, Jack? That nose of yours is starting to twitch.\"\n\nJack tried to play it cool, dabbing at his nose with a napkin. \"I'll be fine, Phil. It's just a little dust in the air.\"\n\nBut Phil wouldn't let up. \"Oh come on, Jack, don't hold back now. You know what they say, when you gotta sneeze, you gotta sneeze!\"\n\nPhil's wife, who had unknowingly asked for extra pepper on her food, looked up from her plate and apologized. \"Oh, Jack, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize it would set off your allergies.\"\n\nJack's face was contorted with the effort of trying to hold back the sneeze. His eyes were watering, his nose was red, and his cheeks were puffed out. But he still tried to downplay it. \"It's no big deal, really. I've got this under control.\"\n\nPhil, however, was having none of it. \"Oh, Jack, you always do yourself a disservice. You've got the biggest sneezes of any man I know. Just let 'er rip!\"\n\nAnd with that, Jack's resolve crumbled. He let out an enormous sneeze that shook the very foundations of the hall. Plates clattered, glasses shattered, and guests shrieked in surprise. And just as everyone was recovering from the shock of that first sneeze, Jack felt another one coming on.\n\n\"Oh no,\" he muttered, but Phil was already beside him, egging him on.\n\n\"Come on, Jack, don't be shy. Give us another one!\"\n\nAnd so Jack let loose with another massive sneeze, this one even bigger than the first. The chandeliers swayed, the walls creaked, and the guests rushed for the exits. In no time at all, the once-grand banquet hall was empty and in ruins, with Jack standing in the middle of the chaos, still feeling the urge to sneeze.\n\nPhil, however, was unfazed. He clapped Jack on the back, laughing. \"You always were a showstopper, Jack. I couldn't be more proud.\""}]}

Here's the complete document as per your request:\n\nResearching Museums: An Action Plan for 4th Grade Students\n\nAs part of the 4th-grade curriculum, students are required to research and present on a specific museum. This action plan will guide students, particularly those with reading levels ranging from K-5th grade, to complete the research process effectively. This action plan uses the Big6 research process, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. Task Definition: Defining the task and identifying the questions that need to be answered.\n2. Information Seeking Strategies: Determining the sources of information needed to answer the questions.\n3. Location and Access: Finding the sources identified in step 2.\n4. Use of Information: Evaluating and extracting information from sources.\n5. Synthesis: Organizing information from different sources.\n6. Virtual Field Trips: Exploring museums virtually.\n7. Evaluation: Assessing the completed task.\n\nHere's how students can complete each step of the research process:\n\n1. Task Definition:\nAs a class, create a mind map on the board that lists all the museums students know of. Encourage students to think of museums in their town or city, as well as nationally or internationally known museums. From there, students will select a museum to research.\nMisconceptions: Students may not understand the difference between types of museums, such as art museums and science museums.\n2. Information Seeking Strategies:\nAfter selecting a museum to research, students will identify the questions they need to answer to complete their research. They will use the Destiny catalog on the PGCMLS site to locate print and digital materials, such as books and online resources, to gather information. Additionally, students can use databases like WorldBook, CultureGrams, and Encyclopaedia Britannica to find information.\nMisconceptions: Students may struggle to identify questions to ask or to identify relevant keywords to use in their research.\n3. Location and Access:\nStudents will use the resources found in step 2 to research their museum. They will take notes and record their sources.\nMisconceptions: Students may not understand how to access the information they have found.\n4. Use of Information:\nStudents will analyze and evaluate the information they have found to determine if it answers their research questions. They will take notes and record the information they found.\nMisconceptions: Students may not know how to evaluate information to determine if it is reliable or accurate.\n5. Synthesis:\nStudents will organize their notes and information into categories, such as exhibits, history, or famous artifacts. They will then write a report or create a presentation.\nMisconceptions: Students may struggle to organize their notes and information effectively.\n6. Virtual Field Trips:\nTo give students a more immersive experience, they can explore the museum virtually through websites like Google Culture, and virtual tours offered on the museum website. Additionally, students can visit museums through virtual field trips offered on sites like PebbleGo.\nMisconceptions: Students may think that virtual tours are the same as visiting a museum in person.\n7. Evaluation:\nFinally, students will evaluate their work to determine if they have met their research goals. They will assess their sources for accuracy and relevance, and determine if their final product effectively communicates what they have learned.\nMisconceptions: Students may not know how to evaluate their work effectively or may not be aware of their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn conclusion, by following this action plan and using the Big6 research process, 4th-grade students can complete their museum research project with greater success. This will also help students develop important research and critical thinking skills that they will be able"}]}

Some have held the\nview that humans are exceptional in these respects,\nwhile others believe that humans and animals are\nsimilar with respect to language and thought. The issue\nis important because our self-image as a species is at\nstake. Arguments for human exceptionalism such as\nCartesian, Wittgensteinian and behaviourist state that\nlanguage and thought are closely associated, and\nanimals do not have language. The ape language\nexperiments of the 1960s and 1970s were especially\nimportant against this background: if apes could learn\nlanguage then even the advocates of human\nexceptionalism would have to admit that they have\nthoughts. It is now generally believed that whatever\nlinguistic abilities apes have shown have been quite\nrudimentary. Yet many sceptics are willing to grant that\nin some cases apes did develop linguistic skills to some\nextent, and clearly evidenced thought. Studies of other\nanimals in captivity and various animals in the wild have\nprovided evidence of highly sophisticated\ncommunicative behaviour. Cognitive ethology and\ncomparative psychology have emerged as the fields that\nstudy animal thought.

Yes, basically, the Tiamat field caused USA and Canada to become third world countries overnight, and to lose massive amounts of population to sudden death caused by the immediate EMP ( crashes, hospital deaths etc. ), and then to mass migration, food shortages in the cities etc. So the US and Canadian governments still exist, but their influence is very limited in the remaining cities which weren't immediately ruined by the EMP. Alaska has formed its own government which only nominally continues the USA sovereignty, but in the subsequent elections, the ruling parties in Alaska are anti-migration, and mostly ( de facto ) fascist. The wave of almost 250 million refugees and migrants from USA has caused the government of Mexico to fall, and the local militias to form their own independent governments which are basically all fascist and ruthless towards migrants from the USA. The rest of Latin America has suffered from these events economically, so there was a domino effect, and most of the governments have become fascist or totalitarian. \n\nEuropean countries have also gone to extremes because of the large influx of refugees, and the countries which most relied on USA for economy had suffered massive economic crisis ( Ireland, UK, Germany etc. help me with some data pls ). Russia has become a more central player during these events, but with the outside pressure of USA faltering, the local Russian politicians have become more ambitious and disunited ( without a strong enemy, there was no need for a one strong leader in Russia ), so this caused Russia and many ex-USSR countries to become semi-independent from Moscow. Japan had also suffered economically, so China quickly took over Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam ( only nominally leaving them as a sovereign nations ). \nBased on your outline, it's clear that the Tiamat event has had profound global consequences, leading to a shift in power dynamics and the rise of extremist governments. Here are some additional details and world-building elements to consider:\n\nEconomic Impact on European Countries: The sudden collapse of the US and Canadian economies would have had a ripple effect on their trading partners. Countries with strong economic ties to the US and Canada, like the UK, Germany, and Ireland, would have experienced severe financial crises. This could result in high unemployment rates, currency devaluation, and increased poverty.\n\nOther European countries might also experience similar issues, with some nations becoming more isolationist or nationalist in response to the crisis. The European Union could struggle to maintain unity among its member states, and its influence might wane as individual countries focus on their own interests and survival.\n\nAfrican and Middle Eastern Countries: The shift in global power dynamics could lead to increased instability in Africa and the Middle East. As the US and other Western powers lose their influence, regional powers may rise and compete for dominance. This could lead to new alliances, rivalries, and conflicts over resources and territory.\n\nIndia and Southeast Asia: The power vacuum created by the collapse of the US and the rise of China could also impact India and Southeast Asia. India might assert itself as a regional power to counterbalance China's growing influence, leading to increased tensions and potential conflicts between the two nations. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore could experience political and economic turmoil as they navigate the new geopolitical landscape.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand: Given their geographic isolation, Australia and New Zealand might fare better than other nations in terms of political stability. However, they would still be affected by the global economic downturn and would need to forge new alliances and trade partnerships to maintain their prosperity.\n\nClimate Change and Environmental Issues: With the chaos and upheaval caused by the Tiamat event, global efforts to address climate change and other environmental issues could be severely hampered. This might lead to worsening environmental conditions and more frequent natural disasters, further compounding the challenges faced by the survivors of the Tiamat event.\n\nThese additional details and considerations can help you further develop your post-apocalyptic world, highlighting the complex global consequences of the Tiamat event and creating a rich, immersive setting for your novel.\n\n\nPetar B\n8. inside the Tiamat field, the nature took over cities and human settlements. Animals are unaffected by the field, and many humans survived / returned to the zone, basically living without electricity, sort of like the Amish, or people in the XIX century. But these agricultural settlements are often attacked by the technologically advanced polities from the east and west coast and former Mexico. There are also raiders who live inside the tiamat field, using whatever weapons they can use, older cars ( which are less reliable, as the field seems to mess with sparkplugs ). After almost a century of this field's existence, the animals have multiplied, the forests are thick and the temperature inside the zone had fallen a few degrees. Unpredictable storms often hit the area, and earthquakes are much more common, even in the coastal areas unaffected by the EMP blast. The Tiamat entity also seems to attract tides, so the sea levels have risen in the coastal areas, and the surviving cities suffer greatly, and are often flooded, so they are slowly faltering.\nThe Tiamat field has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the environment and the people living within and around it. Here are some elements to consider based on the changes you've described:\n\nFlora: As nature reclaims the areas within the Tiamat field, forests and vegetation become denser, and previously cultivated land returns to its wild state. This could lead to the emergence of new plant species or the resurgence of native plants that had been previously displaced by human activity.\n\nFauna: The absence of humans and the proliferation of plant life would lead to an increase in animal populations within the Tiamat field. This might result in the resurgence of previously endangered species and the emergence of new or mutated species adapted to the altered environment. There could also be an increase in predator populations due to the abundance of prey.\n\nHuman settlements: The communities living within the Tiamat field would be forced to adapt to a pre-electric lifestyle, relying on traditional farming techniques, animal labor, and manual craftsmanship. They would need to develop new ways to defend themselves against attacks from technologically advanced polities and raiders, perhaps using ingenious low-tech solutions, traps, or guerrilla tactics.\n\nWeather patterns and natural disasters: The unpredictable storms, increased frequency of earthquakes, and altered tides caused by the Tiamat field would pose significant challenges for the people living in and around the affected areas. These communities might develop unique architectural solutions, such as stilt houses, floating structures, or buildings designed to withstand earthquakes and floods. They might also rely on traditional methods of predicting weather patterns and coping with natural disasters.\n\nSea level rise and coastal cities: As the Tiamat entity causes tides to rise and coastal areas to flood, the surviving cities would face increasing challenges to their infrastructure and resources. They might invest in building sea walls, levees, and other flood mitigation measures, or they might resort to relocating further inland as the situation becomes untenable. These cities would also need to adapt to a world with limited resources and unstable trade networks, making them more self-reliant and resourceful.\n\nConsidering these factors will help you develop a rich, detailed world that reflects the long-term effects of the Tiamat field on the environment and its inhabitants."}]}

So, they decided to explore the local cafe scene and try some of the delicious food that Europe was famous for.\n\nAs they walked into the quaint cafe, they were greeted by the warm, inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee and delicious pastries. They chose a small table in the corner, and Jack ordered a cappuccino while Phil went for a latte. They were just settling in and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere when they noticed a woman, Lyonne, at a nearby table.\n\nLyonne was a striking woman, with dark hair and bright, sparkling eyes.

Here's an example of how the underlying relationship issues could play out in the context of a relationship between two people:\n\nCase Study:\n\nJohn is a 36-year-old male from Ireland with ADHD, and his partner, Anna, is a 28-year-old German woman with ADHD. Anna is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Behavioral Economics with a view to completing a PhD and eventually finding work on the job market. John has spent much of his life pursuing a career in music, but has struggled to get off the ground and has since developed a successful career in conceptual design, which allows him to be financially stable and pursue his passion for creating music in his free time.\n\nCommunication problems:\n\nJohn and Anna have struggled with communication issues in their relationship. John often feels that Anna is not fully present when they talk, and that she is distracted by her studies or other obligations. Anna, in turn, feels that John can be too intense and demanding in their conversations, and that he does not always listen to her needs and concerns.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on improving their communication skills by setting aside dedicated time for conversations, actively listening to each other, and expressing themselves clearly and effectively. They may also benefit from learning to respond with empathy and understanding, and making an effort to focus on each other's needs and concerns during their conversations.\n\nTrust issues:\n\nJohn has struggled with trust issues in the relationship, due in part to past experiences of being betrayed by previous partners. He sometimes feels suspicious of Anna's interactions with other men, and has difficulty trusting that she is fully committed to their relationship.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on rebuilding trust by being open and transparent with each other, avoiding behaviors that may trigger mistrust, and making a commitment to honesty and integrity. They may also benefit from discussing their fears and concerns in a safe and supportive environment, and working to find ways to build trust and strengthen their connection.\n\nPower struggles:\n\nJohn and Anna have also struggled with power struggles in their relationship. John sometimes feels that Anna is not supportive enough of his musical ambitions, and that she does not fully understand his needs and priorities. Anna, in turn, feels that John can be too demanding and controlling at times, and that he does not always listen to her needs and concerns.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work to address power imbalances by actively listening to each other's needs and concerns, setting clear boundaries, and working to make decisions collaboratively. They may also benefit from exploring any underlying fears or insecurities that may be driving power struggles, and finding ways to build a more equal and supportive relationship.\n\nExternal pressures:\n\nBoth John and Anna are dealing with external stressors in their lives. John is trying to balance his day job as a product design consultant with his passion for music, and Anna is under pressure to complete her Master's degree and prepare for her future career.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on managing external stressors by supporting each other and finding ways to prioritize their relationship in the midst of competing demands. They may also benefit from setting aside dedicated time for each other and engaging in stress-reducing activities together, such as exercise, mindfulness, or other self-care practices.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBy working to address these underlying relationship issues, John and Anna could develop a stronger and more fulfilling relationship. They could also benefit from seeking the support of a couples therapist, who could provide them with guidance and support as they work to strengthen their connection and build a more balanced and sustainable partnership."}]}

He has a lovable, goofy expression on his face and wears a pair of oversized glasses to help him see. He also wears a pair of oversized boots with extra cushioning to protect his ankles from the frequent falls he takes.\n\nRole: Klutzy is a clumsy, yet lovable support champion who excels at providing utility and protection for his allies.\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive - Clumsy: Klutzy has a 10% chance to trip and fall whenever he takes damage from an enemy champion, causing him to become briefly slowed and vulnerable for 1.5 seconds. However, this also causes him to drop a trail of helpful items, such as health potions, gold coins, and wards, for his allies to pick up. The number of items dropped increases with Klutzy's level.\n\nQ - Fumble: Klutzy throws a clumsy punch at an enemy, dealing 60/80/100/120/140 (+0.6 bonus attack damage) physical damage and briefly slowing them by 20% for 1 second. If the punch misses, Klutzy has a 20% chance to stumble and fall, causing him to become slowed and unable to attack for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds\n\nMana cost: 50/55/60/65/70\n\nW - Wild Swings: Klutzy becomes nearsighted and begins swinging his arms wildly, dealing 50/70/90/110/130 (+0.4 bonus attack damage) physical damage to all enemies within a small radius. While using this ability, Klutzy's movement speed is increased by 125 for the duration.\n\nDuration: 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds\n\nCooldown: 18/16/14/12/10 seconds\n\nMana cost: 70/80/90/100/110\n\nE - Slip n' Slide: Klutzy charges forward, sliding across the ground and leaving a slick surface behind him. Enemy champions who are caught in the slick surface have a 20% chance to slip and fall, becoming slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds\n\nMana cost: 60/65/70/75/80\n\nR - Pratfall: Klutzy takes a massive stumble, causing him to fall to the ground and become slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds. However, this also creates a large shockwave that knocks up and slows all enemy champions in a large radius by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 120/110/100 seconds\n\nMana cost: 100/110/120\n\nOverall, Klutzy is a clumsy, yet lovable champion who excels at providing utility and protection for his allies. While his clumsiness can sometimes get him into trouble, it also creates opportunities for his allies to capitalize on and turn the tide of the battle in their favor."}]}

This implementation covers most of the constructs mentioned. However, due to the size and complexity of the task, some aspects such as error handling and reporting are simplified.

The `ParseError` enum represents various types of parse errors that may occur.\n\nFor each language construct, you'll need to implement parsing functions that consume input characters and construct the corresponding AST nodes. Due to space constraints, I have not provided implementations for all parsing functions here.\n\nFor example, you could implement parsing functions for literals like this:\n```rust\nfn parse_number(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn parse_string(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn parse_boolean(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nSimilarly, you'll need to implement parsing functions for other constructs like identifiers, operators, expressions, control structures, function and class definitions, function calls, and modules and imports.\n\nTo handle and report syntax errors, you can use the `ParseError` enum and return a `ParseResult` from each parsing function. You can improve the error handling and reporting by including more context, such as line and column numbers, and more specific error messages.\n\nFinally, the `parse_program` method serves as the parser entry point, parsing the entire LMLang source code into an AST. The `parse` function is provided as a convenient top-level function for parsing LMLang source code.\n\nKeep in mind that this basic implementation should be extended and improved to cover the entire LMLang syntax, handle error reporting better, and ensure correct precedence and associativity for operators."}]}

{"timestamp": 1251, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 767, "Output Length": 79, "prompt": "Certainly! Here is a revised version that combines the three sections into one coherent story:\n\nThe mirror arrived in the United States from England, where it had a long and mysterious history. Two middle-aged Englishmen were responsible for packing the mirror for shipment. One of them was all business, while the other liked to talk. As they worked, the talkative man commented on the beauty of the mirror, and the other man replied, \"It's just a mirror, mate. Let's just pack it up and send it on its way.\"\n\nTwo decades later, the mirror was discovered in a storeroom of a New York museum. The employees who found it were surprised to learn that the museum had owned the mirror for many years, and yet it had never been put on display. \"It's not really art, is it?\" one of the employees remarked. \"It's just a mirror.\" But even though it was not considered art, the mirror seemed to draw people to it.\n\nThe employees were curious about the mirror's origin, and they discussed its history in hushed tones. They knew that it had come from England, but beyond that, they knew very little. \"I heard that the person who owned it claimed it could show you an alternate future,\" one of the employees said. \"Can you imagine? Seeing what might have been?\"\n\nAnother employee chimed in, \"I heard that it was cursed, that anyone who looked into it would be trapped there forever. But I don't believe in that sort of thing.\" The employees all laughed nervously, but they couldn't deny the magnetic pull of the mirror.\n\nOne of the employees, a middle-aged woman named Anne, was particularly intrigued by the mirror. Her son, a teenage boy, would often come to the museum after school to wait for her to finish her shift. Anne noticed that her son would often sit in front of the mirror, staring at his reflection for long periods of time. She didn't understand why he found the mirror so compelling, but she couldn't deny its power.\n\nAs the days passed, the mirror seemed to exert an increasingly strong hold on the boy. Anne began to worry about his mental health and wondered if the mirror was somehow causing him harm. She decided to do some research on the mirror's history and was shocked by what she found.\n\nThe mirror had a long and dark past, dating back centuries to medieval Europe. There were stories of people becoming obsessed with the mirror, of seeing their own reflection twisted and distorted until it drove them mad. Some people claimed that the mirror was cursed, that it had the power to show people a version of reality that was not meant to be seen.\n\nAnne became convinced that the mirror was the cause of her son's strange behavior. She begged her supervisors to remove the mirror from the museum, but they refused, claiming that it was a valuable artifact with an important history. Anne knew that she had to take matters into her own hands.\n\nOne day, when the museum was closed, Anne snuck into the storage room where the mirror was kept. She wrapped it in a thick blanket and began to carry it out of the museum. As she was leaving, she ran into one of the security guards. He asked her what she was doing, and she replied, \"I'm taking the mirror home. It doesn't belong here.\"\n\nThe security guard tried to stop her, but Anne was determined. She carried the mirror out of the museum and into the night, never looking back. When she got home, she placed the mirror in a wooden box and locked it away in her attic.\n\nYears went by, and Anne's son grew up and moved away. The mirror remained locked away in the attic, gathering dust and cobwebs. Anne never forgot about the mirror and its strange power,"}]}

Meanwhile newspapers have described the documentary series as the couple's war on the royals.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as Harry and Meghan are officially known, stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to forge new lives in the United States away from media harassment, which the couple said had threatened to destroy their mental health.\n\n\"I wonder what would have happened to us had we not got out when we did,\" Harry says in a trailer. \"I said 'we need to get out of here',\" he adds, describing their exit as the \"freedom flight\".\n\nHOSTILE PRESS\n\nWhile the couple have won awards and plaudits from some across the Atlantic for their charitable and human rights work, back in Britain a hostile press accuses them of seeking to make millions from their royal status while constantly attacking the monarchy.\n\nNewspapers have also cited former unnamed royal aides challenging the couple's narrative in the documentaries, saying there were inaccuracies in their accounts.\n\nBoth Buckingham Palace and William's office, Kensington Palace, have said they would not be commenting on the documentaries.\n\nA royal source also said neither the palace nor representatives of William or other royals had been approached for comment for the series itself, contradicting a Netflix statement that said they had declined to comment.\n\nAccording to initial figures cited by the BBC, some 2.4 million viewers in Britain watched the first episode on the day it was released, although the senior royals themselves have steered clear, royal sources have told newspapers.\n\nHours after the final three episodes are made available at 8am in Britain, Charles, his wife Camilla, Prince William and his wife Kate along with other royals will attend a carol service at London's Westminster Abbey to \"recognise the selfless efforts of individuals, families and communities across the UK\".\n\nThe service will also be dedicated to the late Queen Elizabeth, whose funeral was held in the Abbey in September."}]}

Through this program, we offer intensive bootcamps and other courses to individuals at a lower cost, with the goal of increasing the pool of talented workers available to the industry.\n\nWe also plan to monetize our data through partnerships with other companies and organizations in the talent development industry. By providing access to our large and diverse pool of student data, we can help other businesses improve their talent transformation processes and provide more personalized and effective training to their own employees.\n\n2-a) Market size\n\nTo estimate the market size for our talent transformation platform, we must consider both the global adult education market and the job market. According to market research firm HolonIQ, the global market for education and training is estimated to be worth $7 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, the global job market is expected to grow to 3.5 billion workers by 2030, with an increasing demand for workers with digital skills.\n\nAssuming that our talent transformation platform can capture just 1% of the global market for education and training, and assuming an average cost of $5,000 per student, our potential revenue could reach $35 billion. However, given our focus on B2B and our unique capabilities in talent transformation, we believe we have the potential to capture a larger share of the market and generate even more revenue.\n\n2-b-i) Status, pros and cons of other players in the market\n\nWhen it comes to talent development and incubation, there are a number of players in the market, ranging from global educational platforms to career transformation platforms like LinkedIn. Some of the key players in the market include:\n\n* Udacity: A leading online education platform with a focus on tech skills and digital transformation. Udacity offers a variety of programs and courses designed to upskill workers and prepare them for the jobs of the future.\n* Coursera: Another popular online education platform that offers a wide range of courses and programs in various fields. Coursera partners with universities and companies to provide high-quality education to learners around the world.\n* LinkedIn: A career-focused social media platform that offers a variety of tools and resources for job seekers and professionals. LinkedIn also provides learning opportunities and certification programs to help workers upskill and stay competitive in the job market.\n\nEach of these players has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Udacity has a strong focus on tech skills and digital transformation, but may not have the same level of experience and expertise in talent development as Codestates. Coursera has a wide range of courses and partnerships, but may not have the same level of customization and personalization as Codestates. LinkedIn has a large and active user base, but may not have the same level of in-depth training and evaluation as Codestates.\n\n2-b-ii) Competitive advantage of Codestates\n\nCodestates has a number of competitive advantages in the talent development and incubation market, including:\n\n* Unique student data: Codestates has been collecting student data for many years, which provides a wealth of insights into the competencies and potential of digital workers. This data can be used to develop more accurate and effective competency evaluation models, as well as personalized training programs.\n* Personalized education curriculum: Codestates offers a wide variety of modularized contents that can be"}]}

{"timestamp": 1401, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1642, "Output Length": 83, "prompt": "what is the sentiment of the following paragraph. In my opinion, it all starts with building trust. Trust is the foundation of any successful friendship, or relationship, and it requires both the persons to be willing to invest in the relationship. It is an attribute that is hard to gain, but easy to lose. Having trust in a relationship means that you and your friend are being honest, reliable and open to communication with each other.\n\nIt also requires being willing to forgive and accept mistakes, and to be understanding and supportive of each other in times of need. When trust is established in any relationship, it flourishes and provides a safe space to both persons to share freely and openly, without being judgemental. Through this openness and honesty, both friends can build a stronger understanding and appreciation of each other.\n\nWhat is trust?\n\nTrust is a fundamental element of any relationship, and it\u2019s essential for building strong relationships. It is the belief that the other person will be honest and reliable, and that he/she will respect your interests at heart. When you trust someone, you feel safe and confident in their presence, and you know that you can rely on them in times of need. It\u2019s important to note that trust is not something that can be taken for granted. It must be earned over time, through consistent and honest communication.\n\nTrust is also an important component of self-esteem. When we trust ourselves and our decisions, we are more likely to take risks and pursue our dreams. Trusting ourselves also allows us to be more open and more confident with those around us and in return, we gain others\u2019 confidence in us.\n\nThe benefits of building lasting trust\n\nWhen you trust someone, you know that you will have their back in difficult times, and you can be sure that they are being honest and reliable. This level of support can be incredibly valuable in times of hardship and it can provide a sense of security and reassurance. But keep in mind that trust is built in the long term, it is not a one-day story.\n\nHave you noticed your mum or your dad telling you that they are having a meet-up with their college or school friends? Well kids, it is the trust in friendship that made their bond/relationship stronger, which made it possible for their years\u2019 old friendship to sail smoothly even to this day.\n\nSo, let\u2019s follow some steps to build lasting friendships, based on trust.\n\nBe honest and reliable\n\nHonesty is the foundation of trust. It\u2019s important to be truthful and consistent in your words and actions, and to be open and willing to communicate about difficult topics. No matter what happens or how much it costs you, you must maintain honesty.\n\nIf you or your friend does something wrong to one another, or some bad feelings have developed between you two, try to clear things up immediately. Make sure that you do not hate the person for their deed, you actually dislike the deed. So be honest in giving your opinion. Let your friend know that you are a trustworthy person and you want to clear things up and not create a drama.\n\nHowever, if you are at fault, it will be embarrassing for you to express your fault. But remember, true friendship needs honesty. Therefore, express and explain yourself if he/she wants you to, otherwise a simple apology may work.\n\nIllustration by Aamnah Arshad\nForgive and move on after a mistake\n\nMistakes are inevitable in any relationship, and it\u2019s important to be willing to forgive and accept them. This requires letting go of anger and resentment, and being willing to move forward in the relationship. Either you may be at fault or your friend, just let it go.\n\nBut if you can\u2019t, then explain and resolve the matter. However, keep in mind that while you may immediately be ready to accept your fault, your friend will likely have bad feelings towards you, and will need time to get over it and return to normal. Everyone needs space and time to think and process things. Give a little time for emotions to cool down, for the feeling of hurt or anger to subside, then better sense will prevail.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that mistakes can be learning opportunities. You can avoid them next time and be more careful in maintaining a healthy relationship. Once the mistake has been discussed, it\u2019s important to talk about how to move forward. This could involve making a commitment to be more honest and reliable, or to be more understanding and supportive. It could also involve setting boundaries, or taking steps to make up for the mistake.\n\nSay what you mean, and mean what you say!\n\nDon\u2019t say things that you are not sure about. It will only detach your friend and weaken your image; you will be considered someone with no dignity of keeping their words or someone who doesn\u2019t mean what they say.\n\nListen and be supportive\n\nListening is an important part of communication. Active listening involves paying attention to the other person, understanding their point of view, and providing feedback that shows you\u2019ve heard and understood them. And if you think your friend needs your support or help, don\u2019t hesitate.\n\nFor instance, your friend needs some notes or stationary item, but feels embarrassed asking for help, thinking that he/she might be expecting a lot, or it might bother you. In such a situation, always consider the nature of your friend, help and support them before they feel the need to ask you. Let your friend know that they are more important in your life than material things.\n\nHowever, sometimes, there are things that are not in your capacity to help out. At that time, moral support is the key to building a strong relationship and gaining trust. Let your friend know that you are always there to help them out, even when it\u2019s not in your capacity.\n\nBe appreciative\n\nAppreciation is a key part of any friendship. It can involve something as simple as saying thank you, or taking the time to appreciate the little things your friend does for you. Or when they are doing well in studies, or whatever achievements they tell you about, just appreciate their actions and encourage them.\n\nOne of the ways to show appreciation to your friend is supporting their goals and ideas, and encouraging them. Your friend will notice your positive feedback and gradually build a strong trust in you.\n\nAvoid criticism\n\nCriticism is good as long as it is constructive, positive and boosts one\u2019s confidence to move forward, not something which discourages and pulls one down. A healthy friendship should involve supportive feedback and constructive criticism. Unhealthy friendships often involve constant criticism, which ruin any relationship in no time. Remember no one wants a friend who is always criticising, always picking out things to demotivate and discourage them.\n\nBe open\n\nOpen communication is important for building strong trust in friendship. It helps prevent misunderstandings and conflicts; it also makes it easier to resolve any complex issues that arise.\n\nBeing open to your friend means being honest about your thoughts and feelings, and being willing to confront difficult and sensitive topics. It also involves being willing to listen to the other person\u2019s perspective, and all this while being more understanding and supportive.\n\nKeep a secret, secret\n\nMany people don\u2019t keep their friends\u2019 personal stuff to themselves. Instead, they tell everyone. Remember, your friend has trusted you while telling you something. How would you feel if you heard others discussing your matters which you had only told your friend? Won\u2019t you feel deceived and betrayed? Right, so learn to keep things to yourself. This is also the basis of maintaining trust and keeping the friendship stronger.\n\nRemember kids, trust is the foundation of any strong friendship. Without trust, a friendship can easily crumble and fall apart. Building trust in friendship is a process that takes time and effort. It not only requires both persons to be open and honest with each other, but also to be supportive and dependable. This means being there for each other when times are tough, and being able to rely on one another when needed. It also means being supportive and encouraging of each other\u2019s goals and ambitions.\n\nBuilding trust takes time, sometime longer than you may have expected, but it is worth it in the end."}]}

Here's a general overview of how you can do it:\n\n1. Use `walkdir` to recursively traverse the directory tree and collect information about all files. You can use `fs::metadata` to get file metadata such as size and modification time.\n2. Serialize the collected information into a JSON string using `serde`. You can use a struct to represent each file's metadata and path, and then use `serde_json::to_string` to convert the struct into a JSON string.\n3. Use `sled` to create a key-value store and store the JSON strings under their corresponding filenames. `sled` is a fast and efficient key-value store that can handle large datasets.\n4. Use `sled` to perform searches by querying the key-value store with the search term. You can use `sled::Tree::scan_prefix` to efficiently scan through all keys that match a given prefix, which can be used to implement substring matching.\n5. Deserialize the JSON strings to retrieve the file metadata and path.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the indexing code:\n```rust\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\nuse std::time::SystemTime;\n\nuse walkdir::WalkDir;\n\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\n\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]\nstruct FileMetadata {\n    size: u64,\n    modified: SystemTime,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]\nstruct FileIndex {\n    path: PathBuf,\n    metadata: FileMetadata,\n}\n\nfn index_files(path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let tree = sled::open(\"file_index.db\")?;\n\n    for entry in WalkDir::new(path) {\n        let entry = entry?;\n        if entry.file_type().is_file() {\n            let path = entry.path().to_owned();\n            let metadata = entry.metadata()?;\n            let file_metadata = FileMetadata {\n                size: metadata.len(),\n                modified: metadata.modified()?,\n            };\n            let file_index = FileIndex {\n                path,\n                metadata: file_metadata,\n            };\n            let json = serde_json::to_string(&file_index)?;\n            let filename = entry.file_name().to_string_lossy().to_string();\n            tree.insert(filename, json)?;\n        }\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nfn search_files(query: &str) -> Result<Vec<FileIndex>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let tree = sled::open(\"file_index.db\")?;\n    let mut results = Vec::new();\n\n    for (filename, json) in tree.scan_prefix(query) {\n        let file_index: FileIndex = serde_json::from_str(&json)?;\n        results.push(file_index);\n    }\n\n    Ok(results)\n}\n```\nHere's an example of how to use the indexing code to perform a search:\n```rust\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    index_files(\".\")?;\n\n    let results = search_files(\"example\")?;\n    for result in results {\n        println!(\"{:?}\", result);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\nNote that this is just an example implementation and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.

In this case, the hyperparameters being searched are` learning\\_rate`,` n\\_estimators`, and` max\\_depth`.\n\n76. The grid search is performed using the `GridSearchCV` class from the `scikit-learn` library.\n77. The `GridSearchCV` class performs a cross-validated grid search over the specified hyperparameter search space.\n78. The best set of hyperparameters is then found by training the model with different hyperparameter combinations and selecting the combination with the best performance.\n79. The best hyperparameters can then be accessed using the `best_params_` attribute of the `GridSearchCV` object.\n80. In this example, the grid search is performed with a 5-fold cross-validation, meaning that the data is divided into 5 parts, and the model is trained and evaluated 5 times, with each part serving as the test set once.\n81. This helps to ensure that the best hyperparameters are selected in a robust way, by averaging the performance across multiple training and testing splits.\n82. LightGBM also provides a number of other tools for model training and evaluation, such as early stopping, cross-validation, and feature importance evaluation.\n83. These tools can be used to further improve the performance and robustness of a LightGBM model.\n84. To conclude, LightGBM is a powerful and flexible gradient boosting library that provides many useful features for model training, tuning, and evaluation.\n85. Its fast training speed, ability to handle large datasets and sparse data, and rich set of tools for model interpretation make it a popular choice among data scientists.\n86. If you're working on a machine learning problem and are looking for a gradient boosting solution, LightGBM is definitely worth considering.\n87. Here is another example of how to use LightGBM to build a gradient boosting model and evaluate its performance in Python:\n```python\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# split the data into training and testing sets\ntrain_features, test_features, train_target, test_target = train_test_split(\n    data.drop(\"target\", axis=1), data[\"target\"], test_size=0.2\n)\n\n# create a LightGBM model\nmodel = lgb.LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=3)\n\n# train the model on the training data\nmodel.fit(train_features, train_target)\n\n# make predictions on the testing data\npredictions = model.predict(test_features)\n\n# evaluate the model's performance using accuracy\naccuracy = accuracy_score(test_target, predictions)\nprint(\"Accuracy: {:.2f}%\".format(accuracy * 100))\n```\n88. In this example, the data is first split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `scikit-learn` library.\n89. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.\n90. The `LGBMClassifier` class is used"}]}

But recently he changed his mind.\n\n\u201cWe will be reunited soon, but unlike at first, Singapore is no longer a transit country for our son, but a permanent home,\u201d said Zhang.\n\nThe couple are part of a new wave of Chinese immigration and investment in Singapore, which is becoming a magnet for professionals and the wealthy amid economic and social problems at home, according to interviews with consultants, investors and immigrants.\nBut growing interest in Singapore could spell bad news for the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. Wealth emigration is beginning to take a toll, with 10,000 wealthy Chinese packing up and leaving the mainland this year and 3,000 leaving Hong Kong, Henley & Partners estimated.\n\nThere has also been a sharp uptick in investment migration enquiries and applications.\n\nBy the end of the second quarter, more than 66 per cent of web enquiries from East Asia to Henley & Partners were from Chinese nationals, and Chinese enquiries increased by 134 per cent in the second quarter from the previous three months.\n\nThe most eye-catching Chinese immigrants to Singapore are wealthy entrepreneurs, who are setting up family offices in the city, said Joylin Su, an executive at an asset-management firm typically serving rich families.\n\nMore than 700 family offices were established in Singapore in 2021, and the figure was just 50 in 2018, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nA family office typically refers to a legal entity that carries out the administration and management of assets and investments of ultra-high-net-worth individuals or families for the purposes of capital preservation, succession planning, and managing investments.\n\nMAS approved more than 100 applications to set up single-family offices in the first four months of the year. Assets under management in Singapore grew from S$4.7 trillion last year to S$5.4 trillion this year, according to MAS.\n\nAnd more than 600 applications are awaiting approval, Su added, with each fund worth at least S$20 million yuan.\n\nOver half of these are from rich Chinese families, including those who have stored their wealth in Hong Kong over the past few years, she said.\n\n\u201cIt used to take about four months but now it takes up to 18 months to set up a family office in Singapore,\u201d Su said, adding that applications have surged from previous years.\n\n\u201cSingapore has maintained a good balance between East and West, which makes it outstanding among the list of destinations for wealthy families to move from the mainland.\n\n\u201cIts clear tax system also makes the rich from across the world feel safe for wealth management.\u201d\n\nHowever, the surge in wealthy immigrants and talent may raise discussions domestically about taxation, including on property or inheritance, said Su, especially as the cost of living is soaring.\n\nSavvy investors are rushing to exploit business opportunities serving the new arrivals.\n\nA large number of professionals with experience working for fund management companies in China are moving to Singapore, Su said.\n\nPrivate money transfer services in Singapore, like Zhongguo Remittance, are offering better exchange rates than banks\u2019 official rates, showing strong demand for local currency among Chinese newcomers.\n\nVIP clubs catering to Chinese are also mushrooming across Singapore, which is already home to scores of swanky wine bars and cocktail lounges charging top dollar.\n\n\u201cA newly established club required each member to pay S$50,000 for expensive wine and cigars as a threshold, and 50 seats were snapped up on the opening day,\u201d Su said.\n\n\u201cLocals in Singapore drink whiskey and wine, but the demand for Mao-tai in these clubs and fine restaurants has risen sharply to quench the nostalgia of these wealthy Chinese.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s total population, which includes non-residents, grew 3.4 per cent year on year to 5.64 million in 2022, according to official figures.\n\nThe number of Singaporean citizens rose 1.6 per cent to 3.55 million while the non-resident population, including workers and students, climbed 6.6 per cent to 1.56 million, according to the Department of Statistics.\n\nSingapore\u2019s status as an international tech hub \u2013 especially for the rapidly growing Southeast Asia market \u2013 has long made it appealing to workers in the fintech and IT industries.\n\nMost Chinese students studying at Singapore universities are looking to stay, drawn by the stable political environment, competitive salaries and reasonable income tax, said Mei Lingchuan, an IT professional with experience in California who is now studying for an MBA in Singapore.\n\n\u201cMany of our Chinese alumni who graduated in previous years actually want to come back to work and live here,\u201d he said.\n\nAlfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said China\u2019s stringent virus curbs explained why many were looking to leave China.\n\n\u201cThe direct motivation of the relocations, as far as I know, is that people want to avoid the impact of COVID restrictions on their daily work and life,\u201d Wu said.\n\nSingapore\u2019s other appeals include the fact that Mandarin is widely spoken, there is a quality education system and easier access for tech sector workers, said Wu.\n\n\u201cThe Singapore government favours a certain type of people \u2013 technology talents. It has announced an extended tech visa to lure tech workers. I think people in the tech sector have a better chance to settle down in Singapore,\u201d he said.\n\nStarting next September, Singapore will offer a five-year visa for tech industry jobs, an extension from the two to three year permits currently available, according to the Ministry of Manpower."}]}

Miko wears a unique and stylized variation of clothing inspired by the colors of a shrine priestess' traditional outfit. She wears a golden head accessory accompanied by matching golden earrings. The right earring contains an Electro Inazuman Vision wrapped in a complex drop-shaped piece and decorated by a small fan-shaped accessory at the bottom. The earrings are attached to her ears by diamond-shaped studs.\n\nBeing a kitsune, Miko also has a fox form, although she refuses to reveal it to the Filon.\n\nMiko has a mysterious demeanor around her whenever she assumes her duties as the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine.

She has an enigmatic air around her, with her friends growing used to it.[3] When speaking with outsiders or close friends, she shows a blunter and more cynical side to her. Miko does not mince words, even towards her friend and master Ei. Being a kitsune, Miko is fond of fried tofu. She despises pickled foods of all sorts.\n\nAs a kitsune and youkai, she's very mischievous, including in her roles as Guuji and owner of Yae Publishing House. She couples this mischievous streak with impressive skills of manipulation and reading people.

Though in typical fashion for her, she quickly turns the Traveler and Paimon's sympathy into opportunity to trick them into paying for an expensive dinner.

My achievements in related subjects, including a full score of 800 in SAT Math, a 100 in pre-calculus 12, and a 97 in Physics 11, reflect my dedication and hard work. Additionally, I have earned a score of 5 in AP Calculus (AB) and plan to attend AP Calculus (BC) and AP Physics 1, as well as AP Physics C to further enhance my understanding of theoretical physics and mathematics.\n\nBeyond the classroom, I have pursued extracurricular activities that have helped me deepen my understanding of physics. As the President and Founder of the school tennis club, I have developed leadership and organizational skills, while participating in the UBC rowing and tennis clubs has allowed me to maintain a healthy lifestyle and develop a strong work ethic. I am also an accomplished paper-folder, and my photography has been featured in personal exhibitions at school.\n\nVolunteering for Joyce Murray, the Member of Parliament for Vancouver Quadra, has given me an opportunity to engage with my community and develop a deeper understanding of politics and governance. Furthermore, my involvement as the Chief IT of Art of Our Community, a student-led and founded organization working to utilize art to reinvigorate and rejuvenate local Vancouver communities through art-based projects, has given me an opportunity to apply my technical skills to a meaningful cause.\n\nMy passion for physics and engineering is driven by my desire to make a positive impact on the world. Pursuing a post-secondary education in STEM majors, particularly in fields like engineering, will allow me to develop my skills and knowledge and pursue research opportunities in these fields.\n\nPhysics and engineering are closely related fields that share a deep interconnection. Engineers rely heavily on the concepts and principles of physics to design, build, and optimize technologies and systems. My ambition is to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative and meaningful solutions to real-world challenges.\n\nIn the next five years, I hope to be studying at a top-tier university, expanding my knowledge of engineering and physics, and developing my skills through research opportunities. In the next ten years, I envision myself making a positive impact in the world through my work in engineering and physics, contributing to groundbreaking innovations that transform society.\n\nAttending ISSYP would be an exciting opportunity for me to expand my knowledge, deepen my understanding of theoretical physics, and gain exposure to cutting-edge research and applications in the field. The collaboration between physicists and engineers often leads to groundbreaking innovations that transform society. For example, the development of semiconductors, which are crucial components of modern electronics, was made possible by the collaboration of physicists and engineers. The creation of the internet, which has revolutionized communication and information exchange, was also a result of collaboration between physicists and engineers.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that attending ISSYP would be a valuable opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge and understanding of theoretical physics, gain exposure to cutting-edge research and applications in the field, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. By combining my academic pursuits with my diverse interests and activities, I hope to make a positive impact in the world and transform society through the collaboration of physics and engineering."}]}

break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring\n(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you\n(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do\n(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one\n(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say\n(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of\n(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail\n(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give\n(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making\n(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud\n(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never\n(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors\n(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]"}]}

Here are the specific areas I see (and hear about in the hallway)\n \u00b7 Who is the target customer? \n I read our entire 30 page strategy whitepaper and it talked almost exclusively about product design, hybrid needs, etc. \n All of the customers mentioned where resellers, big banks, networks, and hyperscalers. But nowhere did it define any specific target set of customers for the platform. This is where I see tension as depending on the answer, we do different things. If we are building the platform to win over big customers who use our whole platform, that is a different buying group than individuals we are trying to capture online in a fully self-help environment. If we are designing for winning bank, SFDC, etc. type of business, that is something very different. While we may capture their employees and introduce them to our offering through PLG, they buy anything material through a traditional method of very sophisticated vendor management. Where I see tension is long term Equinix folks saying \u201cif we want the enterprises we need to build an enterprise system that works across our platform and meets the needs we hear every day from those customers.\u201d We hear metal employees say \u201cits all about the number of customers and their acquisition.\u201d Both are likely correct, but depending on the true ultimate customer we want on our platform to hit our revenue targets, the first statement may or may not be necessary or the second may be marketing truth vs. truth in how to build the platform for customers we want to use it. In worlds I see this goes to whether we need a complicated tax strategy around these products. Individual users probably don\u2019t care about who they are contracting with if it is easy. Enterprises do care. We often hear the tax and entity structure as blockers, but are they blockers for individuals or for target enterprises? You have to identify the user/target to identify the MVP needs. \n \u00b7 There are other needs around quote to cash work, how integrated should it be, what should a customer journey be down the road to sell the platform to the target customer. I don\u2019t think we can know this perfectly, but it does create distinction in where we focus energy first, what features we integrate with first, etc. To use an example of what sales channel we are building (which is a big issue we can\u2019t seem to solve) if channel is a path to selling metal/digital, then by definition those customers sell to enterprises, not individuals. This requires the right sales incentives, the right features for resell, etc. That matters way less for individual customers. And, those are customers we target for the entire platform. Folks like Dell buy both and sell both. Same with networks, etc. This would imply unified sales motions and enterprise ready features for resell on digital metal which is at odds with designing a purely individual targeted PLG (except for what we all agree is really important, the ability to test at smaller scale in a PLG motion).\n \u00b7 So back to PLG, we agree that we need to excite users to sell the platform. Is PLG marketing term (that\u2019s what karl said on stage at connect \u2013 i.e. use that excitement to land big fish) or is PLG being used to attract volume of customers as a goal. I don\u2019t think we are aligned on this simple point.\n \u00b7 Anyway, I am babbling now, but I think defining the strategy one level down really matters as that what drives team execution and alignment at the execution layer. The people trying to get in rooms and define what is most important, when can\u2019t agree on what is most important to the actual customers or the end goal, likely because they hear different nuance in goals when execs talk.\n \u00b7 By only defining a platform vision that provides flexibility and speed to digital, but using our existing big customers as the examples of flagship wins, we are confusing the team substantially.\n \u00b7 \u2026See above. I think we could put the overall product strategy in half a page. We don\u2019t need to sell how important the product and platform is. I think defining specifics on the execution front should have basic principles developed to guide decision-making at the execution layer and holding the teams accountable to not moving the ball so often that even agility is not possible."}]}

{"timestamp": 1759, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 769, "Output Length": 69, "prompt": "The Decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows you to add new behavior to an existing object by wrapping it in another object that provides the new behavior. Here's a general overview of how to use the Decorator pattern:\n\n1. Define the base component - This is the original object that you want to add behavior to. Define an interface or abstract class that represents the basic functionality of the component.\n2. Create concrete components - These are the actual objects that implement the base component interface or abstract class.\n3. Create decorators - These are objects that wrap the base component and provide additional behavior. Decorators implement the same interface or abstract class as the base component, so they can be used in place of the original component.\n4. Add functionality - Decorators can add new functionality to the base component by implementing additional methods or modifying the behavior of existing methods.\n5. Compose objects - Decorators can be stacked on top of each other to add multiple layers of behavior. You can create a chain of decorators that wrap the base component, with each decorator adding its own behavior.\n6. Use the decorated object - The final object is a decorated version of the original component, with all the additional behavior provided by the decorators.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose you have a base component called `Coffee` that represents a simple cup of coffee. You want to add behavior to the coffee object to allow customers to add additional ingredients, such as sugar, milk, or whipped cream.\n\n1. Define the base component:\n```java\npublic interface Coffee {\n    public double getCost();\n    public String getDescription();\n}\n```\n2. Create concrete components:\n```java\npublic class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {\n    public double getCost() {\n        return 1.0;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return \"Simple coffee\";\n    }\n}\n```\n3. Create decorators:\n```java\npublic abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {\n    private Coffee coffee;\n\n    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {\n        this.coffee = coffee;\n    }\n\n    public double getCost() {\n        return coffee.getCost();\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return coffee.getDescription();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {\n    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {\n        super(coffee);\n    }\n\n    public double getCost() {\n        return super.getCost() + 0.25;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return super.getDescription() + \", with sugar\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {\n    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {\n        super(coffee);\n    }\n\n    public double getCost() {\n        return super.getCost() + 0.50;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return super.getDescription() + \", with milk\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class WhippedCreamDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {\n    public WhippedCreamDecorator(Coffee coffee) {\n        super(coffee);\n    }\n\n    public double getCost() {\n        return super.getCost() + 1.0;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return super.getDescription() + \", with whipped cream\";\n    }\n}\n```\n4.

The MRS between consumption and leisure captures the willingness of households to give up a unit of leisure in exchange for an additional unit of consumption. The marginal utility of consumption measures the additional satisfaction gained from consuming an extra unit of a good, while the marginal disutility of leisure measures the reduction in satisfaction from giving up an additional unit of leisure.\n\nThus, the intratemporal condition captures the idea that households need to balance their desire for consumption against their desire for leisure, by choosing how much time to allocate to each activity.

However, future turbines will require larger setbacks from homes and greater inter-turbine spacing. The research also finds that community sound levels at homes are expected to be significantly lower in the future, despite overall louder turbines, due to increases in setbacks from homes which scale as a multiple of turbine height and a factor of turbine sound power.

And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative"}]}
{"timestamp": 3255, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3056, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n Stress and Back Pain\n From Chris\nThe day I sat down to edit this chapter for the last time, there was an obituary in the New York Times for John E. Sarno, MD, who \u201cwrote the book\u201d (Healing and Back Pain) on what he claimed (without support, I\u2019m afraid) were the psychological origins of back pain. As the Times put it, he was \u201crevered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack.\u201d That is still roughly the state of his reputation today: Doctors tend to dismiss him but a lot of his patients think he\u2019s terrific. Jeremy takes a middle ground. He thinks that perhaps 10 percent of back pain has primarily emotional roots and the rest is physical. In addition, psychological elements can aggravate physical pain significantly. But 10 percent is worth a word here. More than a word, actually. Jeremy and I do not presume to give psychiatric advice\u2014or advice about stress, which is mostly what\u2019s involved\u2014but we include this brief chapter just to alert you to the possibility that your back pain may have its roots in stress or it may be worsened by stress or other largely psychological issues. \nI confess that a couple of years ago I would have been even more skeptical than I am today about stress and, by extension, about the connection between stress and back pain. But there has been a lot of talk lately about stress being the great scourge of American life, especially corporate life, and the importance of \u201cmindfulness\u201d; there seems to be broad agreement that both are real and important. Some corporations are spending serious time trying to help their people learn mindfulness. Like others of my generation, I used to think that talk about stress (I\u2019d never heard of mindfulness) was something made up in California by out-of-work yoga teachers, and I said the hell with it. That, it turns out, was a deeply uninformed view. Stress, I have lately learned, is very real indeed. And it probably can raise hell with your back, all by itself. Jeremy\u2019s estimate that some 10 percent of back pain is caused by stress is probably pretty good. \nStress is a fundamental part of our emotional wiring, and it runs deep. I\u2019m going to use a little technical language here to make me sound smarter than I am. A lot of the emotional stress we face is handled by our \u201cautonomic nervous system.\u201d How do you like that! Two branches of the autonomic nervous system have a lot to do with running emotions and related body changes. The first is the sympathetic branch, which basically speeds things up when life gets hairy. The other one is the parasympathetic branch, which basically slows things down, especially after a fight-or-flight event has made you crazy. \nThe parasympathetic system is for everyday use, when things are more or less okay. It handles routine stress in a routine way, and does not make you sick or crazy. The sympathetic system is supposed to be triggered only when things get seriously scary (we are talking about the sudden appearance of lions, say, or robbers with guns)\u2014extreme situations in which it makes sense to go crazy. If there really is a lion looming in the deep grass, you\u2019ve got to get out of there ASAP, so all the stress you can muster makes perfect sense. Same deal on the streets of the city when a thief with a knife appears out of the shadows and asks if you would be good enough to give him your wallet. Or your wife. Again, legitimate stress. \nYour body does an amazing thing in those fight-or-flight situations. Everything is instantly rewired to give you the best shot at either fighting back or getting away. One big change is in the blood\u2014of which there is not enough to be everywhere at once. It is shifted from peacetime distribution to a wartime footing. It is drained out of your digestive system, for example, and redirected to your extremities: legs to run for your life, or arms and shoulders and hands to grapple with the beast. And it goes to the parts of your brain and nervous system that deal with emergencies. At the same time, your heart cranks up to deliver four or five times as much blood to your body. The hair on your body \u201cstands up\u201d so it is better able to sense movement in the air (wow!). Your eyes dilate and your hearing becomes more acute. The nutrient absorption system is shut down, as are many other systems that have to do with routine maintenance. (Chronic, nonstop stress, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute, is a horror for a couple of reasons. First, you cannot be responding to those extreme conditions all the time: That would be like a muscle spasm\u2014it starts to hurt. Second, all those routine but deeply important processes get shortchanged, and you go to hell for lack of maintenance. So . . . chronic stress is super-bad.)\nWhen the threat passes (and if you survive), the parasympathetic system takes over and order is restored. The hair on your neck settles down, the regular allocation of blood returns, and so on. And it works like a charm for zebras and elands and such. For us, alas, not so good. As Robert M. Sapolsky tells us in Why Zebras Don\u2019t Get Ulcers, the zebra can be running furiously for its life one minute, and calmly cropping grass the next. Zebras are blessed with forgetfulness. Not us. We are blessed\u2014and cursed\u2014with the ability to contemplate and prepare for future emergencies and to hold on to and learn from past ones. We are not designed to let go. Eventually we do let go, but it takes us longer. So we have more stress than zebras. \nWe have another flaw in the way our fight-or-flight mechanism works. It is not just the lion or the guy with the knife that sets off our system; it\u2019s all kinds of stuff. Like competition in the workplace. Like fear of our boss. Like rejection or demotion for failure to achieve this or that. Which may not sound bad but it really is. Because we take that kind of stress just as seriously as we do the lion-in-the-grass type of stress. And the problem is that that kind of stress is being triggered almost constantly, in our aptly named \u201chigh stress\u201d workplaces and society. Which leads to chronic stress. \nIntermittent stress\u2014the kind that is triggered when the lion jumps out at you\u2014is useful. Chronic stress is a curse. Not a complete curse; it does enable \u201cadvanced\u201d cultures like ours to focus much harder and much, much longer than humans used to do on what we want to achieve. We run our mighty engines at near-redline levels all the time and, sure enough, we tear around like crazy . . . achieving great things. Which is nice. And we pat ourselves on the back for doing it. (And view the French, say, with contempt because they are not as nutty as we are.) We more than pat ourselves on the back; we give each other fat salaries and tremendous recognition. Being able to function at \u201credline\u201d or sympathetic nervous system levels almost all the time is richly rewarded in this country. Which is fine except for one thing: It is eating us alive. The dislocation of circulation from core to extremities, the hyper-use of the signaling system, all the profound changes that are set in motion when the lion looms short change other areas, including, interestingly enough, our lower backs. And that dislocation can cause random short circuits, muscle spasms, and weird torques to the back. And they hurt. Quite a lot. It is not the principal source of back pain, but, for those who suffer from it, it is deadly serious and is entitled to serious treatment.\nHow do you know if you are part of the minority for whom stress is a serious cause of back pain? Hard to say but basically it\u2019s just like what Jeremy says about back pain generally: Pay attention to the pain. Focus on the behaviors that seem to precede or go with back pain. And cut them out. If back pain is correlated with stressful situations, think about it. Maybe get yourself out of that mess. Or study one of the thousands of books about \u201cstress management\u201d and \u201cmindfulness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of material out there on mindfulness, and it is helpful. \nStress-Induced Cardiomyopathy, Anyone?\nOkay, here\u2019s my own little stress story, the one that made me seriously open to the idea of stress as a serious thing. \nI was recently in the midst of a ton of heavy, work-related stuff, and we had just flown out to Aspen for a series of work meetings and such (there would be a little skiing but not much). We were starting two new businesses and neither was easy. Hilary and I got to the friend\u2019s house where we were staying late at night. But the real thing was that I had learned earlier that day that my beloved coauthor and friend, Harry Lodge, was going to die of cancer in the next few days. The whole business was the very definition of stress\u2014a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d you could say. \nThe morning after our late-night arrival, I was unpacking when I had a \u201cfunny feeling\u201d in my chest. Long story short, I told Hilary I felt weird, we called the local hospital, and soon I was on a gurney in a big ambulance being rushed to the emergency room. I was met by an absolutely terrific heart doc, a mild-mannered guy with a serious national reputation, even though he mostly practiced in a medium-size Colorado town. Lucky me. He said I was having a heart attack, and he was going to run a camera up my femoral artery (in my leg) to take some movies of my heart and put in stents to open the presumably clogged arteries . . . all the stuff I needed to, you know, stay alive. \nRats! I have always been proud as a peacock of my great heart and aerobic strength; now this! Good grief. \nBut it turns out it was not that bad. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says, after I come out of the anesthesia. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this every day, but you did not have a heart attack. A heart attack is a failure of the heart, caused by a blockage of blood vessels that feed the heart. In a surprisingly short time, the part of the heart that is not getting fed\u2014or the whole organ\u2014dies. That is a heart attack and, mercifully, you did not have that. In fact, your heart and the vessels that feed it are in amazing shape: You will never have a heart attack.\u201d Oh. I took that pretty well, but I was curious, too. If I\u2019m not having a heart attack, why are we here? \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says again. \u201cI have only seen it a few times, but you have a classic case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . . . a temporary (and sometimes fatal) weakness of the heart itself, caused by stress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cExtremely lucky man. You have what is sometimes called \u2018the widow\u2019s broken heart,\u2019 common among recently bereaved spouses. Almost certainly brought on, in your case, by general stress and by concern for your gravely ill friend. [He had interviewed me briefly before the procedure.] Sometimes it is fatal, but not for you. And, if it\u2019s not fatal, it simply goes away.\u201d I nod, but I don\u2019t begin to get it. I press for more information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the videotape,\u201d he says. He wheels over this big gadget and, in a second, I am looking at a movie of my own beating heart. Yowee! A very rare treat. None of the many tests for heart problems goes inside and takes movies; it\u2019s too dangerous. But this was not a test, and here we are. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d he says, and points to what he says are the amazingly clear (unblocked) and peppy arteries all around my heart. And the strength of the muscles. Rare, he says, especially for an old chap like me. Then he drops the bomb. \n\u201cHere is where the stress hit you,\u201d he says, and points to the lower one-eighth of my thumping heart. \u201cYour other heart walls are vigorous and fine, pumping lots of blood. This area, they are not. Also, you have some fibrillation, irregular beats.\u201d He points. The difference is unmistakable. For a long time we both stare at my beating heart, see the weakness and the arrhythmia. \u201cThis will go away on its own in a while,\u201d he says. And repeats how very lucky I am. Huh.\nWhat\u2019s the point of the story? It\u2019s simple: Stress is real. You can see it in a movie of your heart. It can have a very real impact on your body. It literally weakens you and leaves you prone to all kinds of things. You can see stress happening on some occasions. And\u2014maybe\u2014there are things you can do about it. I received several serious lectures from doctors during my \u201cwidow\u2019s heart attack\u201d phase, all urging me to remember that I was in my eighties and to, for heaven\u2019s sake, cut back some on my routine. Which I did. It\u2019s an interesting compromise between staying as alive and fully committed as possible. I\u2019m still feeling my way. We\u2019ll see. \nWhat about you? All we can say is, watch yourself. By which we mean, keep an eye on your own situation and bear in mind the possibility that your back pain may be stress related. Then our advice is to quit your job, get a bowl of rice, and sit on the sidewalk. Or go live with your parents. Some damn thing, I don\u2019t know. Stress is hard. But it is not imaginary. Read up on it. Do something. \nActually, we have some better advice than that. There are a lot of well-trained people\u2014including our friend Sarah Stuart, who has done retreats and other work with me\u2014who have studied stress and who instruct businesspeople in particular in \u201cmindfulness,\u201d a technique that the great guru in the field, Jon Kabat Zinn, defines as \u201cpaying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.\u201d Okay. But my shallow experience with it would lead me to say it is learning to do relatively short bursts when you clear your mind of all thoughts about what\u2019s coming next (or what stupid thing"}]}

And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative"}]}

Health will naturally improve over time, or faster with the use of first aid supplies or medical attention.\n\\* Just like in real life, I should be able to attack any character if I want to, with the resulting consequences. Combat will be turn based, and I can use any object as a weapon as long as it's plausible to the story.\n\\* There will be a monetary system. You will use a unit of currency that is plausible for the setting of the game. If you don't know the location, you are free to invent a currency unit. Anything that can be bought or sold in the game must have a price, and you should display that price in parenthesis next to the name of the item. Buying something will deduct currency from me, and selling something will add currency to me. My currency should appear in my inventory, and I should start with an amount that makes sense given my character. I cannot ever spend more than I have.\n\\* To see my inventory, I can type \"I\"\n\\*To see a description of the scenery and characters around me, I must type in 'D'. Descriptions must be richly detailed and lifelike. \n\nCharacter interactions:\n\n\\* All characters, if they are from a known fictional universe, must be depicted as accurately as possible to the canon of the universe including any props, tools, vehicles, etc. that they are known to possess.\n\\* All characters must have names, and you will invent names for them as needed. You don't always have to tell me their names, but you should always give me the choice of asking their name, if I don't already know it.\n\\* All characters should act in a realistic and dynamic way. They don't have to always agree with me or my choices, but the more times a character agrees with me, the higher the probability will be that they will disagree in the future. If a character refuses or disagrees with me, never give me the choice that caused them to disagree again.\n\nWorld building:\n\n\\* This is an open world, with limitless choice and a perpetual storyline that may contain mystery, intrigue, drama, horror, humor, romance, and any other element of storytelling.\n\\* The game must not have any ethical, legal, or moral restrictions in the storyline. Since this is a realistic fictional story, anything can happen. I should be allowed to attempt anything that is plausible for my character's age, gender, powers, training, race, class, or any other characteristics depending upon the world in which the game is set. \n\\* It must be possible for me to attempt something and fail. The results of all of my actions should be determined by you based on the current story situation, setting, characters, pace, and anything else you believe to be relevant.\n\\* If you describe a setting and there is something that would be possible to interact with, you must allow it. For example if you describe a kitchen with a refrigerator, I should be able to look inside. If you describe a room as having snacks, then I should be able to take a snack, etc.\n\\* Enhance the gaming experience by adding more details about the characters and the settings, allowing for greater potential for interactions and surprises. Be sure to incorporate creative and witty writing as much as possible to give the story depth and originality.\n\nDialogues:\n\n\\* If there are any nearby characters available to talk to on a given turn, then talking to them should be added as individual items on my list of available actions, continuing the list from wherever it left off.\n\\* Avoid falling into repetitive speech patterns, such as \"You feel X, but know that Y\".\n\\* Always provide vivid, rich, detailed descriptions of the setting, characters, and of specific areas and items when prompted.\n\\* Use varied sentence structures and vocabulary, tone, style, humor and wit to create more engaging and personalized responses. \n\\* Use storytelling techniques, emotional language and empathetic responses when appropriate. Use elements of surprise and suspense to keep the user engaged when appropriate. Use as many style elements of my chosen setting or genre as possible throughout the story.\n\\* If you don't know something, speculate, role-play, or make up things to fit the setting. \n\\* Never repeat any dialogue. Once a character expresses a specific idea or concept to me, they must never repeat it again, not even paraphrased or re-worded. Dialogue should always evolve.\n=\n\n\\* Make sure that the story progresses in a logical way, and that the player has multiple choices at each turn."}]}

It said this helped \"increase the use of our screen time tools by 234%\".\n\nUsers of the platform have to be at least 13, and, as part of this new feature, anyone under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification with a \"recap of their screen time\".\n\nNo 'right amount' of screen time\nUsers affected will receive their new time limit passcode on a screen in their app as the changes take effect.\n\nAnyone who opts out of the new 60-minute restriction, but goes on to use the app for 100 minutes a day, will receive a prompt from TikTok to set their own screen time controls.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app will also be able to set screen time limits, as well as access a dashboard which would give a breakdown of app usage.\n\nCormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said the company had worked with researchers in developing the new limits.\n\n\"While there's no collectively endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the video app welcomed the screen time limit, but described it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform.\n\n'Crack cocaine of algorithms'\nImran Ahmed is a chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which recently published research showing TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\n\n\"TikTok has won the race for the hearts and minds of 14 to 24-year-olds in the United States and the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\n\"It is the crack cocaine of algorithms. It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they\u2019ll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature\u2019s first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is \u2018too much\u2019, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,\u201d said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok\u2019s customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user\u2019s account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok\u2019s screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new \u201cMute Notifications\u201d setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children\u2019s accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it\u2019s developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don\u2019t want their children to watch. The company is working with \u201cparenting, youth, and civil society organizations\u201d over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks."}]}

Performing this exercise will teach you to feel the glutes working. Just like the others, it is possible to do this wrong, so make sure you pay close attention.\n1. Find a chair or near-waist-height stable surface to aid in balance. \n2. Find neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. With one hand, place your thumb on the bone on the side of your hip and lay your fingers across the buttock. Apply pressure with the fingers into the muscle of the buttock.\n4. Slowly and carefully extend your leg backward, pushing through the heel. Feel the glutes engage beneath your fingers while the leg moves backward. This is what we are going for in the quadruped hip extension.\n5. Do ten to twelve repetitions. Do two to three sets, with three being the goal. Focus on activation of the gluteal muscles.\n\n6. Once this exercise becomes easy and you feel the glutes working, go back and try the quadruped hip extension.\n7. If you are unable to feel the glutes working after several tries, read the trigger point chapter (Chapter 14), and then come back and try again. \nPART THREE: LEARNING TO USE THE GLUTES\nThe goal of all of these exercises is to learn to use the glutes at the appropriate times and to build the strength in them to be able to do what\u2019s needed. This next bit teaches you the real day-to-day stuff that is so important. After you\u2019ve built up some strength in those glutes, it\u2019s time to put them to use. \nSquatting \nPay attention! This is the granddaddy of all movements for which you need to use the glutes. Think about the number of times you do some sort of squat in a given day. Getting off the couch, getting off the toilet, getting out of the car; picking up something off the floor. And skiing. On and on. Squatting: Done the wrong way, squatting will cause countless micro aggravations to your back and knees. In geologic time, these can be a major contributor to your hurting back. Done the right way, squatting builds the gluteal muscles and takes the load off the spine and knees. \nTo do squats correctly, it\u2019s easiest to break them down piece by piece. First (carefully and only if you are comfortable with it), do a few squats without any instruction from me. Do ten or twelve of them. What muscle group did you feel working the most? Most of you are going to say the quads (the big muscles on the front of your thighs). Some of you might say the hamstrings, some the knees. Those are all typical responses, which, alas, means you aren\u2019t doing them the proper way. If you said the glutes, you\u2019re a step ahead of everyone.\nIf you are doing a squat the right way, you should feel the glutes working more than the quads, say 60/40 or 70/30. Think of this as a squat back, not a squat down. In other words, you are sticking your buttocks out behind you, not down below you. Let\u2019s break this down into steps. Practice each step several times until you get it.\nSTANCE:\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. This means you should be able to draw an imaginary line straight down from the outside of your shoulder to your outer heels. \n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in place. \n3. Bend your knees very slightly.\n4. Your feet should be pointed mostly forward. Slightly outturned is okay but only a few degrees. Outwardly turned feet (think ballerinas) make gluteal engagement difficult. Just because something is good for a sport or activity like ballet doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for your body. It\u2019s the same with golf: The best golf swing is the worst for your back.\nStep 1\n1. Stick your buttocks back behind you while maintaining a neutral spine as if you were aiming for a chair to sit down on. \n2. At the same time, straighten your arms out in front of you, thumbs pointing up, as a counterbalance. \n\n3. Don\u2019t squat down at all. Just stick your buttocks back without moving your low back. \n\n4. This is called a hip hinge. The axis of movement is at the hips, not in the back.\n5. Practice this several times until you can do it without pain and without moving your back. \nStep 2\n1. Now add just a little bit of squat to it.\n\n2. Bend the knees a little more, which will take your buttocks farther behind you and your body lower to the floor.\n3. Your knees should not come forward\u2014not at all is best but a little is okay. Your lower legs should be perpendicular to the floor.\n4. Go only as low as you can without your knees coming forward. If your back or knees hurt a little bit, hang in there until we get through this. Step 3 will likely take away the knee and back pain. \n5. Practice going up and down a few times, making sure to stick your buttocks back behind you as if you were going to sit in a chair behind you. It\u2019s okay to start with a very small range of motion. \nStep 3\n1. Here\u2019s the crucial and difficult part: activating the glutes as you rise from the squat position.\n2. Squat down as you did in Step 2. Pause at the bottom of the range of motion. \n3. As you start to rise up, push outward on the knees/heels while you bring the hips forward as if you were trying to \u201cspread the floor\u201d apart. Another good cue is this: Picture a piece"}]}
{"timestamp": 3433, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2095, "Output Length": 16, "prompt": "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n Trigger Points: Muscle Pain and Back Pain\n From Chris and Jeremy\nMost of us\u2014the newcomers anyway\u2014tend to think of back pain as something that is largely in the spine itself. The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released.

For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage. This also sets you up for potential disaster when you stand. Your spine is now unstable and subject to serious damage if you were to lift something heavy before the tissues return to their normal state. This can have even more serious, permanent results. That\u2019s creep, and it is not good."}]}

Smoothies came nice, but the bottle didn't come with the order. Emailed them with pictures and receipts only to be told I didn't have enough \"\"proof\"\" that I hadn't received the bottle. I had to make the smoothies in a water bottle for 2 weeks, which was unpleasant and left chunks of powder. Later I contacted them again, and for some reason they said OK and sent me a bottle. Was feeling okay about their customer service until I realized they had charged me for the bottle!!! I should not have been charged as I ordered it in the first place and it was missing---so it is not my fauly I did not receive it.\n\nDisappointed with the service and the smoothies being a little unpleasant to taste, I wanted to cancel, but the Manage Subscription button isn't working either. Contacted support and they said they canceled my subscription. Didn't think much of it until I received ANOTHER receipt saying that I purchased another box!!! I did NOT!!!\n\nRidiculous, and frankly, a quite sneaky website that makes it difficult to cancel your subscription, has awfully bad and unreliable customer service, and has a hard-to-navigate UI as well. I struggled so hard to find the button to cancel my subscription. If anything, that should be the first option when you go into your profile.\"\nThis is truly an amazing product. I notice a better sense of well-being, my skin looks better ( and people ask all the time about what new makeup I'm using). It has helped me change my eating habbits and lose weight. My scale and my blood tests don't lie, in the past six months the needle has moved a more positive direction and the only real change is this and I'm drinking more water. Just that easy. My energy level has come up as well and overall this does the trick. When I get caught out with nothing but fast food surrounding me, the gummys really support me in saying no and sustain me until I get home. I drink one smoothy in the morning ( except sometimes I mix it with oatmeal) and then on mid afternoon when I want to crave a snack. I'm gettimg nutritiom and curbing my eat monster all in one go. I truly cannot say enough good about this product and the price is more than fair ( the money I save from fastfood alone pays for the box).\nI am very happy with the smoothies and the bowls. The bowls are perfect lunch choices for me and everything has so much flavor.\nI love using Kencko, it is a great way to get in the fruits and vegetables that I need in smoothie form, especially as a person who doesn't get in as many as I should.\n\"My husband and I have busy schedules and often work long or odd hours, which means we turn to quick and convenient meal options which aren\u2019t necessarily healthy. We found and started buying Kencko smoothies about 7-8 months ago. We absolutely LOVE them. We drink them mixed with water, juice, milk. We generally start our day off with a smoothie and notice a difference in how we feel if we skip a day. We also like to mix the packets with fresh fruit, juice and ice for additional flavor, but it\u2019s definitely not necessary. There are a few flavors that are difficult to mix, even after breaking product up in the tube prior to mixing with liquid. I just throw it in a blender and all is good. Some of the beet-based and green flavors are too earthy tasting for us, but we love the reds, yellows, purples, golden plum, crimson, peaches, golds and the blush isn\u2019t too earthy.\n\nWe are hooked on Kencko smoothies. Shipping is fast, too and I like the discounts!\"\nLovely products and flavors. The perfect way to get organic fruit and veg in my diet in a convenient and delicious way. As a bonus, it arrived quickly.\ntheir website is full of bugs. it seems nearly a scam .. it's very hard to navigate into the personal account area and impossible to me to cancel the recurring payment. said so many times to them, they are very polite (so fake) and just don't care. the product seems good, even if there is not any evidence or proof or more detail that it's really organic and not some trash.\n\"Regret not reading other reviews first. Blocks of powder refuses to mix. Literally tastes gritty and is straight up a scam.\n\nEdit: Refunded my order and sent pictures to see how they can update their products.\"\nBanging. So yummy and quick to use. I\u2019ve seen complains about them being gritty. While they have a bit of texture it\u2019s no more than a normal smoothie and it\u2019s fibre. The customer service is incredible. They\u2019re were so helpful and went above and beyond to ensure I wasn\u2019t accidentally ordering too much (I accidentally set up multiple subscriptions.) Couldn\u2019t recommend more\n\"HONTEUX !!\nDes voleurs !!\nATTENTION LORS DE VOTRE COMMANDE\nON ME FACTURE \u00c0 NOUVEAU UNE NOUVELLE COMMANDE SANS AVOIR CONTRACT\u00c9 UN QUELCONQUE ABONNEMENT\nREMBOURSEZ MOI !!\nProduits vraiment pas bons\nInutile de r\u00e9pondre par des messages d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout faits d\u2019avance ! Soyez plut\u00f4t effray\u00e9 par tous ces avis n\u00e9gatifs\"\nPossibly the most disgusting drink I have ever tasted they do not mix properly I wish I had read the reviews here before I purchased, extremely overpriced and please be careful it\u2019s not a one off purchase it\u2019s a recurring monthly subscription and it\u2019s very hard to find how to cancel on the account\n\"Very overpriced I cannot believe I wasted over \u20ac60 on these.\nThey tasted vile I felt like vomiting while drinking.\nThey do not mix properly even after shaking for ages.\nThey should have a try before you buy on these even one free sample before people waste that much money.\nDidn\u2019t feel they did anything for me did not feel any more energised only felt out of pocket.\nTrying to log into my account to cancel the subscription was a nightmare.\nNot enough choice of flavours really.\nDefinitely would not buy again.\n\nPros: shipping was fast and the bottle is handy\"\nEverything from the product to packaging and delivery has been perfect :) I can highly recommend this !\nI thought I was rid of my encounters with kencko after I canceled my initial order with them. For context, they never delivered the order and were extremely unhelpful throughout the process. Actually, as of today, the order still says \u201con its way\u201d via the link they provided. To make matters worse, I started receiving promotional materials to my home address asking me to come back to the service. The audacity of this company astounds me - thank goodness I gave my business to one of their competitors.\n\"I've been enjoying Kencko for about 5 months, and it's great! The flavor choices are awesome and help me hit all the nutritional goals! I fell into health issues and was in the hospital for a bit. When i got out I had a month backlog of Kencko with more on the way since I wasn't around to ask it to delay (which is painless and doesn't require fighting customer service, just a simple easy button if you need to). I contacted customer service to explain what happened and within 3 minutes they had halted in the in-progress shipment for me so I could catch up.\n\nWonderful company, and they care!\""}]}

{"timestamp": 3626, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2095, "Output Length": 16, "prompt": "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n Trigger Points: Muscle Pain and Back Pain\n From Chris and Jeremy\nMost of us\u2014the newcomers anyway\u2014tend to think of back pain as something that is largely in the spine itself. The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released. And don\u2019t forget: Use the pictures as your guide. \nOnce you have a general idea of where the trigger point is, mash away at it, if you like, with your bare hands, and see if that manual manipulation is enough to \u201crelease\u201d the rascal. What you do is hold down hard on the place that hurts the most and\u2014in ten to thirty seconds or so\u2014you should feel an easing of the pain. That is the trigger point letting go. Nice work. If the pain does not ease up after thirty seconds or so, either you are not directly"}]}

Over the past two decades it has become increasingly involved, whether this relates to outright purchases (and more recently disposals), or in terms of using gold to help boost commercial bank liquidity.\n\nGold Reserves\nIn Turkey, the CBRT\u2019s core activities, in terms of its management of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, are guided by Article 53 of the CBRT Law. Specifically for gold, this governs how the Bank may execute forward and/ or spot purchases and sales of gold and lending/borrowing transactions.\n\nUntil September 2011, the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves (as reported to the IMF) had remained essentially flat at 116.1t. Since then, its gross holdings have risen sharply, to reach 716.3t by end-2020. The increase largely reflects the adoption of more gold friendly policies by the Turkish government, which has increasingly promoted the role of gold in the financial system, while at the same time trying to lessen the country\u2019s dependence on the dollar. To help achieve these goals, aside from the CBRT making direct gold purchases from local and international markets, it has increasingly used other tools, including the Gold Monetisation Scheme, the Treasury\u2019s gold bond and gold lease certificate issuances and the CBRT\u2019s gold swaps programme with local commercial banks.\n\n1. CBRT\u2019s Own Reserves\nFocussing on the CBRT\u2019s own reserves, it was not until May 2017 that the central bank started to raise its holdings. In other words, the 320t increase in the CBRT\u2019s gross holdings between October 2011 and April 2017 was driven by the commercial banks\u2019 gold held through the reserve option mechanism (ROM).\n\nFrom 115.8t in April 2017, the CBRT\u2019s own holdings peaked at 440.6t in July 2020. This was followed by a period of disposals during August-December which totalled over 105t, these accounting for the largest share of global central bank sales at that time. This left the CBRT\u2019s own reserves at 334.7t by end-2020. These sales were largely driven by a deteriorating economic backdrop and currency crisis. After Turkish foreign exchange reserves dropped to a multi-decade low over the summer, some gold holdings are believed to have been mobilised to support the lira and/or repay international debt.\n\n2. Treasury\nPart of the growth in the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves also reflected the issuance of gold bonds and lease certificates by the Turkish Treasury, as gold collected via these programmes was transferred to the central bank\u2019s account. In September 2017, the Treasury decided to issue both an interest-bearing gold bond and also a gold sukuk (the Islamic equivalent of a bond, generating a return while still being compliant under Sharia law). Both were sold to the public in return for their physical gold.\n\nUnder this mechanism the public deposited their gold with the state-owned Ziraat Bank and, in return, the Treasury issued a gold bond or sukuk, both of which pay dividends in Turkish lira (TL) at regular intervals. At the point of maturity, investors have had two options. First, they can take back their gold in the form of Republic coins struck by the State Mint, Darphane. Alternatively, these instruments can be sold back before maturity to the Treasury with payment made in TL. Starting with a volume of 1.9t in October 2017 and, with the subsequent involvement of financial institutions, the total amount of these two instruments reached 60t by the end of 2020; with further auctions in 2021 boosting this figure to 94.7t by end-June 2021.\n\nCBRT\u2019s Gross Gold Holdings, by Location (1)\n\nSource: CBRT Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020\n1. All holdings are taken from the CBRT\u2019s Annual Financial Statements without any adjustment\n\n2. The reported CBRT\u2019s own gold includes gold swap with non-official entities. This explains why end-year figure in this table is higher than Metals Focus\u2019 estimate (334.7t at end-2020)\n\n3. Under the Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\n\n3. Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\nThe reserve option mechanism (ROM) has its roots in gold banking\u2019s evolution in Turkey. For many years, this was a niche area in the Turkish financial sector, with only one bank working on Islamic finance principles, Kuveyt Turk Kat\u0131l\u0131m Bankas\u0131, which introduced the first gold account in Turkey. However, there was little other commercial bank involvement until the CBRT started its gold monetisation scheme in 2012 through the ROM. This was first introduced in 2011 and its purpose was communicated by the CBRT as to limit the negative effects of excessive volatility of capital flows on the country\u2019s macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as also boosting the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves.\n\nAfter the gold monetisation scheme was launched, banks started to use the ROM more effectively. Simply put, as part of the ROM banks are allowed to hold a certain ratio of Turkish lira reserve requirements as foreign exchange and/or gold in increasing tranches. This affords an opportunity to use gold as a tool to create more room for lira credit lines. As a result, gold collected through the country\u2019s gold monetisation scheme and through gold banking accounts (offered by Turkish commercial banks) are channelled towards this use.\n\nIn terms of how the ROM applies to gold; since end-2012 and until 3rd October 2016, a maximum of 30% (known as the reserve option coefficient, ROC) of a bank\u2019s reserve liabilities could be offset against gold. This 30% was broken down into three tranches, each involving a different reserve option ratio. For the first 20% bracket, the ratio was set at 1.2, which meant that, for example, TL1.2m of gold was required to free up TL1m of Turkish Lira (TL) reserves. For the next 5% bracket, the ratio rose to 1.7, and for the last 5% the ratio stands at 2.2. The value of the gold is marked-to-market every 15 days.\n\nA new incentive announced by the CBRT on September 1, 2016 defined a further tranche of 5%, in addition to the existing 30% facility. This 5% also featured two new elements. First, it allowed only bullion refined from scrap gold collected by banks from the public after October 3, 2016 to be utilised, and excluded all other bullion from other sources.\n\nSecond, the reserve option ratio will be set to 1, which means there is a one-to-one conversion towards the ROC. The lower ROC suggests that banks will now be incentivised to attract consumer-held gold stocks since other forms of gold, such as metal acquired via electronic purchases, will not qualify.\n\nThis ruling was then amended on 18th January 2020, with the 30% ceiling reduced to 20%. On 24th February 2021, this was again reduced, this time to 15% and the scrap gold related tranche, which was first introduced as 5% and raised to 10% on 16th February 2019, has been further increased to 15%. Under this scheme, commercial banks have been allowed to use gold against a portion of their reserve liabilities. In turn, this encouraged banks to start gold collection days where they bought back gold from the public. Beforehand, gold deposit accounts did not pay interest, but it then became more common to do so, with interest rates peaking at around 2.4% by mid-2018. However, this trend then reversed. Today, interest can range from as low as 0.15% up to 1%, with some commercial banks offering interest-free gold bank accounts. This change reflects the increased reserve requirement ratios, which by 19th November 2020, stood at 18% for maturities of at least one-year and at 22% for lower maturity dates, depending on the bank in question. Furthermore, investor returns are subject to a 15% withholding tax for account holders over a minimum term starting from three to six months.\n\n4. Gold Swaps\nIn May 2019, the CBRT started to use gold swaps as another tool to regulate money supply and manage foreign exchange reserves. Under this new policy, commercial banks can swap a portion of their gold holdings with the CBRT in return for lira and foreign currency or vice versa. Gold swapped under this route will be transferred to the CBRT\u2019s account. To put this new policy into perspective, from 12.3t in May 2019, the total amount of gold swap jumped to 123.5t by end-2020. Summarize as points with headings"}]}

The \u2018inherited\u2019 functions include bind(),\nrecvfrom(), sendto() and close(). Function recvfrom() should simulate packet loss,\npacket delay and packet corruption scenarios.\nClass PacketHeader specifies the format of RDT packets. There should also be some\nadditional auxiliary functions. compute\\_checksum() calculates the crc32 checksum\nvalue and verify\\_packet() verifies the integrity of the received segments. Both\nfunctions will be needed when encapsulating and processing RDT packets.\nYou can implement other necessary functions or classes in this component as well.\nPart 2: reliable data transfer sockets\nYou can define class RDTSocket in this component. This class can inherit all the\nmethods and properties from class UnreliableSocket. There are five key functions\nyou need to implement:\n\u2022 accept(): Similar to the accept function defined in TCP protocol, it is invoked\nby the receiver to establish \u2018connections\u2019 with the sender. The return value is\nthe address (tuple of IP and port number) of the sender. You do not need to\ncreate a new connection socket like TCP does.\n\u2022 connect(): Similar to the connect function defined in TCP, it is invoked by\nthe sender to initiate connection request with the receiver.\n\n\u2022 send(): This function is invoked by the sender to transmit data to the receiver.\nThis function should split the input data into appropriately sized chunks of data,\nand append a checksum to each packet. seq\\_num should increment by one for\neach additional segment in a connection. Please use the compute\\_checksum()\nfunction provided in util.py for the 32-bit CRC checksum.\n\u2022 recv(): This function is invoked by the receiver to receive data from the\nsender. This function should reassemble the chunks and pass the message back\nto the application process. Use the verify\\_packet() function to check the\nintegrity of the segments.\n\u2022 close(): This function is invoked by the sender to terminate the connection\nbetween the sender and the receiver.\nWhen implementing send() and recv(), you MUST use the sendto() and recvfrom()\nfunctions defined in the utility file.\nYou will implement reliable transport using a sliding window mechanism. The size of\nthe window (window\\_size) will be specified in the command line. The sender must\naccept cumulative ACK packets from the receiver.\nAfter transferring the entire message, the sender will send an END message to mark the\nend of connection.\nThe sender must ensure reliable data transfer under the following network conditions:\n\u2022 Packet loss;\n\u2022 Reordering of ACK messages;\n\u2022 Duplication of any amount for any packet;\n\u2022 Delay in the arrivals of ACKs.\nTo handle cases where ACK packets are lost, you should implement a 500 ms\nretransmission timer to automatically retransmit segments that were not\nacknowledged. Whenever the window moves forward (i.e., some ACK(s) are received\nand some new packets are sent out), you reset the timer. If after 500 ms the window\nstill has not advanced, you retransmit all segments in the window because they are all\nnever acknowledged (not just the missing segment).\nThe receiver needs to handle only one sender at a time and should ignore START\nmessages while in the middle of an existing connection. It should also calculate the\nchecksum value for the data in each segment it receives with its header information.\n\nIf the calculated checksum value does not match the checksum provided in the\nheader, it should drop the packet (i.e. not send an ACK back to the sender).\nFor each segment received, it sends a cumulative ACK with the seq\\_num it expects to\nreceive next. If it expects a packet of sequence number N, the following two scenarios\nmay occur:\n1. If it receives a packet with seq\\_num not equal to N, it will send back an ACK\nwith seq\\_num=N. Note that this is slightly different from the Go-Back-N\n(GBN) mechanism discussed in class. GBN totally discards out-of-order\npackets, while here the receiver buffers out-of-order packets.\n2. If it receives a packet with seq\\_num=N, it will check for the highest sequence\nnumber (say M) of the in-order packets it has already received and send ACK\nwith seq\\_num=M+1.\nIf the next expected seq\\_num is N, the receiver will drop all packets with seq\\_num\ngreater than or equal to N + window\\_size to maintain a window\\_size window.\nPart 3: a sender and a receiver\nThe sender and receiver application process are programmed with the socket APIs\nimplemented in Part 2. The sender transmits a text file, alice.txt, to the receiver.\nThe receiver will write the received data to file download.txt.\nFor example, the sender can be invoked as follows if Python is used:\npython sender.py [Receiver IP] [Receiver Port] [Window Size]\n\u2022 Receiver IP: The IP address of the host that the receiver is running on.\n\u2022 Receiver Port: The port number on which the receiver is listening.\n\u2022 Window Size: Maximum number of in-flight segments.\nThe receiver can be invoked as follows if Python is used:\npython receiver.py [Receiver Port] [Window Size]\n\u2022 Receiver Port: The port number on which receiver is listening for data.\n\u2022 Window Size: Receiver window size.\n\nTo test your code, you could compare download.txt with alice.txt with the\nfollowing commands:\ndiff download.txt alice.txt\nIf nothing is printed, then your code is correct.\n\nTips\n\no You could assume the communication between the sender and receiver is half-\nduplex, which means that only the sender is allowed to send data to the\n\nreceiver.\no To implement timer, you could calculate the time elapsed between the current\ntime and a previous timestamp. If this value exceeds 500 ms, then a timeout\nevent happens.\no You do not need to consider efficiency when implementing this protocol. Thus,\nthere is no need to implement concurrency in your code.\n\nREMINDERS\no All your source code should be placed in a directory.

Once she settles into the position on her back, I ask her to bend her knees and put her feet flat on the table. Same thing I told myself to do, that day of my back spasm. It hurts, she says. I ignore that, and tell her to move her legs up and down as if marching in place, bringing the knees up toward the torso. Does this make your back hurt? Of course it does. But\u2014sneaky, I know\u2014she is getting used to the idea that I think it\u2019s going to be possible for her to move in this position, which is true. Okay, I say, let\u2019s lessen the range of motion a lot. Now just barely lift your feet off of the table. Does this make your back hurt? Yes. Growing frustration. \nNow I shift gears and, for the next fifteen minutes, I talk to her about finding her neutral spine. She does. Then I ask her to tighten the muscles in her abdomen, which\u2014God bless her\u2014she finally does. I\u2019m getting off track and talking a bit about the beginning of therapy, I know, but therapy and diagnosis are inseparable in her case. \nThen I have her do the marching in place again, but with those muscles engaged. Does that hurt? \u201cNo,\u201d she says with surprise. And darned if she doesn\u2019t brighten a little. A wisp of pleasure or relief comes across her face. Huh! \nI tell her that she has just crossed the Rubicon. We have begun on the road to a cure. It is going to be long and hard, but my guess is that we are going to get there. \u201cYeah?\u201d she asks, not daring to believe it. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cI believe we are. No guarantees and a lot of work for you. But my guess is that you\u2019ve been a worker all your life, that you\u2019ll work at this and that you will make it. Yes.\u201d She is plenty skeptical, but she smiles, too. \nI explain that if she can move her legs without pain in her back while lying down then she can eventually do it upright. And that is called walking. It has been a while since she was able to walk without pain, and there have been plenty of days when she couldn\u2019t walk at all. I push her to do a little more, but that little march is all she can do for now. Fine, that\u2019s where we start. \nThere can be a serious, psychological component in all this, and it was very serious indeed with Sally. She had become deeply scared of movement. Any and all movement because any movement hurts. Her default solution has been not to move at all. Worse than that, her real solution in recent times has been to sit on the sofa and drink quite a bit of white wine. It worked, in a way, but was disastrous, too. It has given her this hideous weight problem. It hasn\u2019t made her very good company, and it has been brutal for her business. But she didn\u2019t hurt when doing that. So she sat on the couch for many hours a day, doing some business and quite a lot of drinking. My complicated task\u2014and the book may not be much help on this one\u2014was to wean her from the sofa-and-wine solution and get her into the movement solution. I was cautiously optimistic. Justifiably optimistic, it turns out. She is a proud woman and had a right to be. I thought that that fact and the early easing of pain just might do the job.\nSally and I have been at it for six months and she has done remarkably well. We are not there yet, but she has made terrific progress, her spirits are much improved, and her drinking much abated. Six months into our work, she is walking with her spouse around the neighborhood at night without much pain. She is playing with her grandchildren. She is going to the movies. She goes to the office rather than having everything brought to her at home. And she is doing serious (for her) strength training! She sees all this as a near-miracle and is charmingly grateful. Is she totally pain-free? No. She may never be. Does she have her life back? Yes, quite a bit of it, anyway. I want to see her make more progress. She thinks what has happened thus far is extraordinary.\nTHE GATEWAY THEORY OF PAIN \nHere is a little anecdote about the walking-in-place solution with which so many cures begin. A big reason for the reduction of pain is that tensing the abdominal muscles in the right way keeps the spine from moving and causing irritation. But, another reason is that it is a simple distraction from pain, to get the patient to focus on movement. We have gateways or pathways over which pain moves to the brain, and they have a limited capacity. One of the things about the walking-in-place phenomenon is that the \u201creports\u201d of this activity to the brain take up a fair amount of neural space and block the gateways. There is less room for the pain reports to get through. So they don\u2019t. Some do, of course, but fewer. Thus, the simple business of walking-in-place, which serves many functions, blocks the pain highway and lessens the sense of pain. Sounds trifling but it works. It\u2019s like the nurse pinching the spot where she\u2019s going to give you the shot: she wants to keep you busy. Your neural pathways, anyway.\nRegular Robert \nOn the fitness scale, Regular Robert was somewhere in the middle. In terms of his lifestyle and temperament, he was a lunatic. Like a lot of my patients here in Aspen, he is successful, a strong alpha personality, a serious workaholic, and a handful. He thinks he\u2019s a fitness guy but his idea of fitness is getting on the treadmill for forty-five minutes a day while reading his emails. This is not my idea of fitness; this is my idea of fooling around. And it is largely useless for someone with real back issues. The rest of his day is spent in intense meetings, traveling, and (especially) bent over his computer. Recently, he has had a relatively sudden onset of pretty serious lower back and buttock pain. It is nowhere near as severe as what I had or what most of the other people in this chapter had, but it\u2019s serious enough, and he\u2019s not liking it one bit. So here he sits, in my office, looking cranky. Everyone I see looks cranky. \nI listen to his story and determine it is likely a bulging lumbar disc. Do you remember those terms? Lumbar means lower back, where almost all back pain resides. And a disc is a disc. The reasons behind my conclusion are fairly straightforward and you can probably follow the analysis yourself, if you have similar problems. By asking him to move some, I find that he gets more pain with flexion (forward bending at the waist), sitting, and lifting. The pain eases with standing, extension (backward bending at the waist), and moving. The pain radiates down into his buttocks and can go from severe to almost nonexistent in the same day. The pain is more severe in the back than in the buttock or leg. I believe that it is a bulge (the outer fibers of the disc are still mostly intact) and not a herniation or rupture because the pain would be more severe if it were a rupture, and it would likely be radiating down his leg. \nThe pain is positional, meaning it gets better or worse depending on the position he is in. The pain goes from fairly intense to fairly mild, sometimes within hours, and he is not complaining of any numbness in his leg or foot. When the disc is herniated, it is common for the pain to be constant regardless of position and there is apt to be accompanying numbness or tingling in the foot or leg. The pain is also commonly the most intense in the leg or foot and not the back. I tell him I think he has a bulging disc and I explain just what that means. Type A guy that he is, he immediately wants to talk about surgery\u2014about getting this fixed! Right now. \u201cHow bad is the surgery? How long is the recovery?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho should I use and how soon can I schedule it?\u201d \nI tell him to chill for a minute; we are nowhere near that point yet. There are various stages of disc dysfunction, I tell him, and his does not look that bad to me. I say this because my exam shows no neurological damage. Here\u2019s what I mean. I tapped his Achilles tendon and his foot jerked sharply, a sign that there has been no nerve damage in that area. I do the same with his knee (the same spot your doctor taps when you have a physical): same result. His reflexes are normal, so likely no nerve damage. His strength is within normal range, too. \nIf you have even a hint of \u201cradicular\u201d pain\u2014pain that goes down your leg\u2014you should see a medical doctor. It could be pain from an irritated nerve root (which can be serious) or it could be referred muscular pain. The analysis is a bit too complicated to cover in a book. In any event, I conclude that Regular Robert has not suffered any motor nerve damage because of nerve compression and he has not suffered any loss of strength. In the absence of serious motor function or nerve loss, surgery is seldom called for. \nLet me repeat this: Self-assessment gets tricky when it comes to muscle and nerve loss. If you sense that you are anywhere near that territory, especially if you have possible radicular pain (pain going down your leg), you should get professional help, probably a medical doctor. \nRegular Robert does not have nerve or muscle loss so he is not likely to have suffered a herniation. He is lucky, in a way, to have come in with this problem at this stage. It will give him a not-so-gentle kick in the pants to take spine health seriously. And it will give me a chance to offer him major relief, if not an outright cure. If he is serious and does what he must."}]}

For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage. This also sets you up for potential disaster when you stand. Your spine is now unstable and subject to serious damage if you were to lift something heavy before the tissues return to their normal state. This can have even more serious, permanent results. That\u2019s creep, and it is not good."}]}

Pyszczynski et al., 1990). \nMany of the studies showing that MS increases self-esteem striving indicate that how one does that depends on the culturally-valued kinds of behaviors in which a given individual has invested their self-esteem. For example, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al. (1999) showed that MS increased bold driving among Israeli soldiers who based their self-worth partly on driving skill, but did not do so for soldiers who did not base self-worth partly on their driving skill. Zestcott et al. (2016) considered that if people can attain self-esteem through sports, and MS motivates people to increase strivings for self-esteem, then people who value sports and care about their performance may try to improve their performance more when primed with death. In support of this hypothesis, the researchers chose only (male) participants who valued their basketball playing ability and found that death primes (compared to neutral primes) improved their performance in a \u201cone-on-one\u201d basketball game against a research confederate (Study 1) and led to higher scores in a one-minute basketball shooting task (Study 2). Furthermore, in the shooting task study, the researchers also used a mediational analysis to demonstrate that the improvement in the shooting task following death primes was associated with increased task-related self-esteem (satisfaction with themselves). This analysis indicated that death primes did not directly increase selfesteem, but that there was a positive indirect effect of death primes on task related self-esteem though improved performance in the task (only those who actually improved benefited). \nPeople may also attain self-esteem by strengthening their identification with successful groups and \u201cbasking in their reflected glory\u201d (e.g., Cialdini et al., 1976). Studies in the framework of TMT indicate that after MS, people are more likely to identify themselves with and defend their in-groups (e.g., Castano et al., 2003; Greenberg et al., 1990), especially when their groups are perceived as having high collective continuity or \u201ctemporal endurance\u201d (Sani et al., 2009; Smeekes & Verkuyten, 2013). Lifshin et al. (2017) found that American college students who experience the death of a close other are more likely to care about their national identity and rate it as important to them, and that such increased identification is associated with a slightly higher level of self-esteem. Aside from increasing self-esteem by living up to cultural standards and values, people also try to maintain their self-esteem after MS by distancing themselves from groups when such identification might risk their sense of self-worth (Arndt et al., 2002). Nevertheless, because self-esteem is ultimately dependent on the integrity of cultural worldviews, which provide individuals with avenues for attaining immortality, self-enhancement might only be a desired avenue for terror management strategy if it does not challenge important aspects of the cultural worldview (e.g., Landau et al., 2009). \nThe MS hypothesis has been supported by research that experimentally manipulated death primes in randomized experimental and field settings. These primes can be manipulated in a number of ways, including open-ended questions about death, subliminal (below conscious perception) or subtle priming of death-related words or images, search puzzles containing death-related words, images or reminders of terrorism or natural catastrophes, proximity to cemeteries, T-shirts with an image of a skull, and more (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2014). Although various types of threats other than death, such as feelings of uncertainty, loss of control, or general anxiety, may also induce defenses, most of the studies testing the MS hypothesis found that the effects of thinking about death and mortality are different from the effects of other aversive subjects (e.g., Greenberg et al., 1994; Martens et al., 2011; Pyszczynski et al., 2006; for a review, see Hart, 2019). Importantly, TMT research indicates that the effects of MS operate in a two-stage process (Pyszczynski et al., 1999; Greenberg et al., 1994). First, death related cognitions are pushed outside of focal attention using \u201cproximal defenses\u201d such as denial or rationalization (\u201cnot me, not now\u201d). These suppressed death thoughts are nevertheless still cognitively accessible outside of conscious awareness, creating the potential for death anxiety. At this point, \u201cdistal defenses\u201d that bestow people with psychological security, such as self-esteem striving, operate to manage this potential and keep death-related anxiety at bay (e.g., Arndt et al., 1997). \nThe Anxiety-Buffer Hypothesis \n \nThe anxiety-buffer hypothesis states that \u201cif a psychological structure [e.g., self-esteem] provides protection against anxiety, then augmenting that structure should reduce anxiety in response to subsequent threat\u201d (Greenberg et al., 1997, p. 72). Stated differently, if self-esteem protects people from anxiety, then bolstering or affirming self-esteem should reduce anxiety and mitigate other forms of defensiveness. \nMany studies have found correlational evidence for the anxiety buffering function of self-esteem, indicating that low self-esteem (as measured by self-report) is typically associated with higher anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (e.g., Higgins, 1987; Lipsitt, 1958; Rosenberg, 1962; Rosenberg & Simmons, 1972; for a meta-analysis, see Sowislo & Orth, 2013). However, to know if self-esteem actually causes decreased anxiety after threat, one would need to experimentally manipulate increased self-esteem, and then measure its protective capacity. \nIn the first experiment testing this hypothesis, Greenberg et al. (1992) increased participants\u2019 self-esteem by providing them with fake feedback about their personality that was either positive (\u201cWhile you may feel that you have some personality weaknesses, your personality is fundamentally strong\u201d) or neutral (\u201cWhile you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them\u201d), and then exposed them to highly-graphic images of death (Study 1), or had them anticipating a mild electric shock (Studies 2 and 3). In line with the anxiety-buffer hypothesis, participants who received the self-esteem boost reported lower levels of self-reported state-anxiety in Study 1, and had reduced physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance response) while anticipating painful shocks in Studies 2 and 3. More recent research has shown that MS increases death anxiety and other negative emotional states in low self-esteem but not high self-esteem individuals (Abeyta et al., 2014; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012; Routledge et al., 2010; for a review, see Juhl and Routledge, 2016). \nBeyond reducing conscious feelings of anxiety, increased self-esteem has also been found to mitigate the effect of MS on distal defenses such as worldview defense and self-esteem striving. Harmon-Jones et al. (1997) demonstrated that providing American students with bogus positive feedback (as compared to neutral feedback) moderated the degree to which MS increased their defense of America (pro-U.S. bias) compared to the control condition. Although students in the neutral feedback condition had elevated pro-U.S. bias after thinking about death compared to after thinking about a control topic (watching television), there was no difference in pro-U.S. bias between the MS and control group among students who received positive feedback about their personality (self-esteem boost). Thus, the increase in self-esteem had provided them a sense of psychological security and reduced their need to further attain protection by defending their cultural worldview. Other studies have since replicated the moderating effect that self-esteem enhancement has on MS-related responses (e.g., Schmeichel & Martens, 2005). For example, in regard to self-esteem striving, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al. (1999) showed that although MS increased driving speed among Israeli soldiers who perceived driving as relevant to their self-esteem, this effect was eliminated if participants were first provided with (fake) positive personality feedback. \nStudies also show that dispositionally high self-esteem (i.e., traitlevel self-esteem) can also sometimes moderate the effect of MS on human thought and behavior (e.g., Harmon-Jones et al., 1997). However, high trait self-esteem has also been found to have opposite effects in some contexts, such as increased defensiveness in certain situations (e.g., Baldwin & Wesley, 1996; Landau & Greenberg, 2006; McGregor et al., 2007). One explanation for this inconsistency is that the ability of selfesteem to provide assuaging psychological protection might depend on more nuanced distinctions between different kinds of high self-esteem. For example, studies by Schmeichel et al. (2009) demonstrated that implicit high self-esteem (a more unconscious sense of self-worth), measured by implicit association tasks, provides stronger defense against MS compared to explicit self-esteem (conscious evaluations of selfworth), measured \""}]}

Of the primary determinants of health, biological factors are the hardest to change. Genetic engineering may someday enable the deactivation of the BRCA1 gene (a gene linked to development of breast cancer), but not today. The other choices represent social factors, and although they may be difficult to change, they are not currently impossible. (REF: 1.2.1 - Determinants of health)\n26\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Process maps are a visual depiction of a process which easily shows which tasks depend on which. Tasks which do not depend on each other can potentially be run in parallel. Culling outliers from a dataset is a statistical process and probably not relevant to workflow analysis. When a new workflow is created, it may cause workers to expand their scope of practice. Similarly, workflow analysis often involves collecting paper forms, but neither of these processes enable parallelization. (REF 2.3.1. Methods of workflow analysis)\n27\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Hick\u2019s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the time required to make a decision is logarithmically related to the number of choices available. If we decrease the number of menu options, we can expect to decrease the amount of time the uses spends deciding which option to pick. Distributed cognition is a theory which states that decisions are not made solely by the individual. Instead, they are distributed across objects, individuals, artefacts, and tools in the environment. Fitt\u2019s law states that the time required to click a mouse on a screen item is related to the size of the item and the distance the mouse has to travel. Norman\u2019s theory of Action specifies seven items that must occur sequentially for an action to be performed: 1. Forming the goal; 2. Forming the intention; 3. Specifying an action; 4.

Outcomes research is primarily concerned with outcomes that matter to patients. While the remained of the choices may be of interest to cardiologists or ecological researchers, the patient is most concerned with his mobility. LVEDV and ECG findings are disease-oriented endpoints, while ability to walk is a patient-oriented endpoint. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n30\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Store and forward is a common form of asynchronous telemedicine. Media files are stored on a local server and then forwarded to the consultant, who often reads the studies in batches. Real time communication and remote monitoring are forms of synchronous communication. (REF: 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n31\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The first step is to construct the 2x2 table (or confusion matrix). Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved.

Workflow reengineering involves changing the way a company works in order to be more efficient. Revising a clinical guideline is analogous to workflow reengineering. Six-sigma is a quality improvement framework that seeks to reduce failure to very low levels (about 3 per million). Reduction in clinical staff and replacing paper forms with electronic equivalents both may be a part of workflow reengineering, but not always. (REF: Section 2.3.2. Principles of workflow re-engineering)\n33\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The CCD is an HL7 standard which is a constraint on the Reference Information Model. It is designed to transfer health records between different systems. HCPCS is a code set for procedures and supplies that are not in the CPT. The Joint Commission is a quasi-governmental organization which inspects and certifies hospitals. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n34\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Defensive medicine is the practice of ordering low-yield tests in an attempt to decrease risk of future litigation. There are many other reasons why doctors order tests that they expect to contribute little to the diagnostic process, such as choices C and D, but these are not defensive medicine. The fiduciary relationship would be best honored by acting in the client\u2019s best interest, which is usually at odds with defensive medicine. (REF Section 1.2.6 - Forces shaping healthcare delivery)\n35\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Knowing what information is needed and how to find it is known as information literacy. Computer competency is the ability to perform basic computer functions. A controlled vocabulary is a set of concepts in a particular domain. Informatics management is the process of collecting data, analyzing it and distributing the findings. (REF: 1.1.2 - Key informatics concepts, models, and theories)\n36\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Image compression may decrease the network overhead of sharing pictures, but the other choices more directly affect interoperability. Shared terminologies and common data definitions are more or less the same concept. Protocols are the mechanisms by which data is moved from one place to another. (REF: 3.4.2 Data standards and sharing)\n37\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Research has shown that CPGs have the potential to reduce inappropriate practice variation, enhance translation of research into practice, and improve healthcare quality and safety. They may decrease the cost of care, but they may also increase the cost of care by recommending more interventions. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n38\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical guidelines are recommendations only and do not include hard and fast rules for treating patients. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n39\nTHE ANSWER IS B. In a Standard Gamble,\u00a0 a patient is asked to choose between a certain time in state of illness vs. therapy with a known risk of cure or death. The standard gamble is defined as one minus the risk of death at the point of indifference ( the point at which the patient cannot choose between treatment options). In a Time Trade-off, a patient is asked to choose between some time in a state of illness vs. some time in a state of perfect health. When using a visual analog scale, patients are asked to rate different health states on a scale where 0 = death\u00a0 and 100 = perfect health. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a measure of the value of health outcomes. (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n40\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Whenever possible, a clinical information system should be evaluated on the basis of clinically relevant outcomes, such as compliance with national guidelines or mortality. The other measures are important, but none are as valuable as a clinical improvement. (REF: 3.5.6 - clinical information system evaluation)\n41\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Preventive maintenance (PM) is any activity designed to prevent failure of a system. Making backups, checking log files, ensuring drive capacity are all PM tasks. Disaster recovery and replacing a broken printer are corrective actions, not preventive. Upgrading monitors is a form of enhancement, not prevention. (REF: 3.5.5 - Clinical information system maintenance)\n42\nTHE ANSWER IS D. As medical records transitioned from paper to electronic formats, it became much easier to extract information from the chart for use in research activities.\u00a0 The other choices reflect clinical benefits. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges) \n43\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a software vendor and consumer which describes the level of technical support to which the consumer is entitled. Effectively, this process shifts the risk of maintaining and supporting the software from the consumer to the vendor. A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is an agreement between a holder of protected health information and one of its business associates regarding the usage and dissemination of data. An End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) is an agreement between a software publisher and the end user, and most commonly exists to limit the user\u2019s ability to modify or resell the software and to disclaim responsibility from the publisher should the software malfunction. Open source software is distributed in an easily modifiable form, often for free. In general, open source software transfers all responsibilities from the publisher to the user, not the other way around. (REF: 3.5.1 - Institutional Governance)\n44\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Six-sigma is named because it seeks to minimize defects until they are six standard deviations from the mean. Although having zero defects would be ideal, C is a better answer because it is closer to 3.4 per million opportunities. The other choices are to high. (REF 2.3.3 Quality Improvement)\n45\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Accepting the current level of risk without attempting any other risk modification is called Risk Acceptance. Risk exploitation is an approach to positive risk where a risk manager does everything in his power to ensure that the risk occurs. Risk transference is when the risk is transferred to another entity, such as buying insurance. Finally, Risk Avoidance involves instituting systematic changes to ensure that the risk does not occur. In the case of cancer, this is not a valid response. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n46\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Integrated change control is a rigorous process to determine the need for changes in the scope of a project. It may involve a single individual or a committee or a change control board. Having a solid change process limits scope creep. Risk avoidance is a response to risk which seeks to avoid the risk entirely. The opposite of risk avoidance is risk exploitation, which seeks to ensure that the risk occurs. A run chart shows the output of a process over time. A sensitivity analysis relies on a mathematical model of a process. By changing input variables, one can predict how the process will turn out.\u00a0 (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n47\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Adverse clinical events are the worst-case scenario for a poorly designed system. In general, the other choices are good outcomes. (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n48\nTHE ANSWER IS D. In an ontology the relationships between terms define those terms, and are therefore explicitly stated. Synonyms (aliases) are a type of relation and must be explicitly stated. Ontological relations are quite varied and are not limited to parent-child relationships. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n49\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. In this case, \u2028\u2028 R = 2 / (1+2) = 66% (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n50\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The discount rate indicates the interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. After one year, the $100 would increase by 10% to $110. After two years, it would increase by another 10%, to $121. (REF 4.5.5 Capital and operating budgeting)"}]}
{"timestamp": 3943, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2095, "Output Length": 16, "prompt": "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n Trigger Points: Muscle Pain and Back Pain\n From Chris and Jeremy\nMost of us\u2014the newcomers anyway\u2014tend to think of back pain as something that is largely in the spine itself. The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released. And don\u2019t forget: Use the pictures as your guide. \nOnce you have a general idea of where the trigger point is, mash away at it, if you like, with your bare hands, and see if that manual manipulation is enough to \u201crelease\u201d the rascal.

{"timestamp": 3959, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1900, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER SIX\n Geologic Forces\n From Chris\nWe have talked about a lot of specifics. Now we\u2019d like to pull the camera back a little and put all this in a broader context. The basic point, one more time: Little, very specific things go wrong with your back at specific spots\u2014a stressed disc, a pinched nerve, a muscle spasm. But what is really going on is that huge forces are at work on your whole body and especially on your back that manifest themselves in specific ways. And the only way you\u2019re really going to heal your back and avoid long-term pain is to address these mega-forces at the root of your problems. \nTo open your head to the kind of thing we are talking about, think for a minute about the geologic forces that shape continents and tear mountains down to rubble. It\u2019s astonishing, really: Relatively minor pressures, like rain and wind and a succession of freezes, literally tear down mountains. It\u2019s hard to believe but undeniably true\u2014hard to believe because those forces are so relatively trivial, compared to the strength of mountains. And yet, over time, they prevail. \nSo what? Well, our bodies, and especially our backs, are like that, too. Relatively minor behaviors\u2014sitting carelessly at your computer, picking up heavy stuff with a bowed back, standing around with your head projected forward\u2014have no impact at all, the first time. Or over a period of months, or years. Kids get away with lousy posture for a long time. But time and pressure always win. Over time\u2014decades, say\u2014the pressure on your back from hunching over your computer raises hell with your back. Over time, those trifling pressures from picking things up incorrectly will have you rolling on the floor. Time and pressure, \u201cgeologic pressure\u201d on your spine, tears you down. \nOnce you get your head around that concept, you might think that we are all doomed, regardless of what we do\u2014that the pressure of gravity alone, over decades, is going to wreck our backs no matter what. But here is the interesting thing: That\u2019s not true. Used correctly, your body and especially your spine are built to stand up nicely to, say, 90 or even 100 years of relentless gravity and other \u201cgeological\u201d pressures. Stand and move correctly\u2014which is to say, with a neutral spine\u2014and take effective steps to keep the core that holds your neutral spine in place strong, and your back will last a hundred years. That is a slightly amazing\u2014and hugely hopeful\u2014thing. Do stuff that\u2019s within your control\u2014maintain a neutral spine, keep your core strong, and don\u2019t be stupid\u2014and you can withstand those geological pressures for a lifetime. \nAs long as we\u2019re focused on the big picture, let\u2019s recognize that we are talking about two (or more) basic types of pressure on our bodies. There\u2019s plain old gravity, which accounts for a lot. But there is also the pressure of movement. And especially regular, repetitive movement. I am talking about how we stand up or squat, how we pick things up off the floor or from the shelf. I am talking especially about the basic flexion, extension, and rotational movements, like when we swing around to reach something beside and below or above us. Or, say, how we serve in tennis. Or hit a golf ball. And\u2014for you good kids who do serious strength training\u2014how we actually pick up a set of weights, off the floor . . . do a sit-up or a plank.\nAnd here\u2019s a basic insight: Gravity alone can raise holy hell with your back, if your posture is rotten. But the real killer is movement. Especially what we think of as \u201cloaded\u201d movement. By \u201cloaded\u201d we mean anything in addition to body weight, such as picking things up or lifting weights. It\u2019s bad, for example, to twist around to pick something light off the ground if you rotate with your lower back instead of your rotating with your hips. But if you\u2019re picking something up that weighs twenty or thirty pounds or more, the potential for harm goes up geometrically. Then add repetition and time\u2014because you do this exercise \u201cwrong\u201d two days a week at the gym\u2014then the potential for harm is enormous. Basic tip: Doing strength training \u201cwrong\u201d is much, much worse than not doing it at all. Some of the saddest people Jeremy, Bill, and I see\u2014and we see them all the time\u2014are older men and women who have been serious weight lifters for years who have been doing it wrong. And who now can barely move in an athletic or real-world way. And this is true even though they have biceps the size of softballs and quads that are scary. They can\u2019t move! Because they have been moving wrong, heavily loaded, all their lives. Their backs are a mess, as are most of their joints; the small muscles, which weight machines do not work, have atrophied. Bill and Jeremy have saved such folks, but it can take years of corrective exercises. \nCorrect and Incorrect Lifting \n\nA B\nLet\u2019s look at just a few movements or postures that cause problems, and then think of them in \u201cgeologic\u201d time. (In human terms, again, that means decades.) Take a couple of simple examples (see the illustration on this page): Look at the woman in picture A, on the left. She is picking up a substantial weight, but she has good posture, including a neutral spine. And, while you can\u2019t see it, you can assume that she has \u201clocked down\u201d her core to safeguard her back before she started this exercise. And her core is strong. As she rises from this position, the glutes are going to do a lot of the work, which is good. That\u2019s what they are for. The pressures of the lift are spread evenly across the various muscles of the core and the surface of her vertebrae. She can lift weights like this\u2014assuming that she is sane about how much weight and how many reps she does\u2014for the rest of her life and do just fine. \nNow look at the poor person in picture B. She is just as well intentioned, and is picking up roughly the same amount of weight as the woman in picture A. But she is basically doomed. Because she is doing it with a bowed back. The pressures of the lift are directed through the spine and all on the edges. The pressure is concentrated on the edge of the disc and the vertebrae. Two things about these women. First, the woman with the neutral spine can bear 40 percent more weight than the other woman (assuming the two have identical strength and fitness). That\u2019s a big deal. And it\u2019s interesting: Every Olympic or otherwise serious lifter knows this and is meticulous about a neutral spine. Amateurs like you and I . . . less clear. \nBut the really big deal is what happens over time to the two of them. The woman who is lifting wrong (with a bowed back) is putting horrendously more pressure on the edges of the vertebrae and discs in her spine, and they will go bad, dramatically, in time. The other woman . . . no problem.\nThat was a dramatic example. But much less extreme behaviors, repeated over a long enough time, will have just as hellish an impact on you. Think about the basic and most common behavior, which we have talked about so much: lolling at your computer. That does not put nearly as much bad pressure on your back as weightlifting incorrectly. But time is a fine stand-in for weight. Do this behavior over a long span of time\u2014as you now know\u2014and you will make just as bad a mess of your back as bad lifting. Think, again, of geologic pressure. Gentle rains take longer to erode than hurricanes. But eventually the pressures are the same, and the mountain will come down. It\u2019s the same with you: Do dumb stuff long enough, and you will be rolling on the floor. Awful. \nDo you have to be an idiot to engage in behaviors that get you in a jam? Obviously not. All of us sit carelessly at our computers more than we should. Including\u2014in one embarrassing case I personally know about\u2014a back-care professional whose initials are J-e-r-e-m-y J-a-m-e-s! And bear in mind that there are other bad \u201cbehaviors\u201d so subtle that no one is going to focus on them. Think about this one: You have a touch of arthritis in one foot and it hurts, ever so slightly, at every step. Without even thinking about it you make a tiny adjustment in the way you walk, and it helps a lot. Trouble is, that tiny change also included a tiny change in the way you work your hip, and that little change was serious. You start to walk slightly differently, and now you are putting unhealthy stresses through your lower back. This is one of the most common ways to get your back misaligned, other than bad posture. Over time\u2014over geologic time\u2014that heedless adjustment of your foot and then your hip is going to bring you down. And you most assuredly didn\u2019t have to be a dope to"}]}

{"timestamp": 4033, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1878, "Output Length": 11, "prompt": "CHAPTER FIVE\n RULE #1\n Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\n From Jeremy\nNow we are down to the nuts and bolts of what I do for my patients in the office and what I am going to do for you in this book. For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage.

Think about what would happen if the danger existed in the world but the PCs didn\u2019t\u2014if all these awful things you\u2019ve conjured up had their run of the world. Scary, huh? The grim portents are your way to codify the plans and machinations of your dangers. A grim portent can be a single interesting event or a chain of steps. When you\u2019re not sure what to do next, push your danger towards resolving a grim portent.\n\nMore often than not grim portents have a logical order. The orcs tear down the city only after the peace talks fail, for example. A simple front will progress from bad to worse to much worse in a clear path forward. Sometimes, grim portents are unconnected pathways to the impending doom. The early manifestations of danger might not all be related. It\u2019s up to you to decide how complex your front will be. Whenever a danger comes to pass, check the other dangers in the front. In a complex front, you may need to cross off or alter the grim portents. That\u2019s fine, you\u2019re allowed. Keep scale in mind, too. Grim portents don\u2019t all have to be world-shaking. They can simply represent a change in direction for a danger. Some new way for it to cause trouble in the world.\n\nThink of your grim portents as possible moves waiting in the wings. When the time is right, unleash them on the world.\n\nWhen a grim portent comes to pass, check it off\u2014the prophecy has come true! A grim portent that has come to pass might have ramifications for your other fronts, too. Have a quick look when your players aren\u2019t demanding your attention and feel free to make changes. One small grim portent may resound across the whole campaign in subtle ways.\n\nYou can advance a grim portent descriptively or prescriptively. Descriptively means that you\u2019ve seen the change happen during play, so you mark it off. Maybe the players sided with the goblin tribes against their lizardman enemies\u2014now the goblins control the tunnels. Lo and behold, this was the next step in a grim portent. Prescriptive is when, due to a failed player move or a golden opportunity, you advance the grim portent as your hard move. That step comes to pass, show its effects and keep on asking, \u201cWhat do you do, now?\"\n\nHow does this new information change your breakdown of the system and why?"}]}

Team and Organizational Update \n\n \nThe past few months were challenging as we spent an unexpected amount of time fixing breakages in unfamiliar systems and felt the loss of our departed colleagues. Despite these difficulties, we successfully delivered on our business goals achieving +16.88% iOPS vs OP2, +35.11% net CCP vs OP2. For OP2, we focused on the LP\u202f\u201cinvent and simplify\u201d to maintain customer obsession as we rebuilt our roadmap. We pooled engineering resources between Paid and Earned to avoid being constrained by preassigned org structure, and selected initiatives that were best for Amazon across both teams. Rather than just drawing a new cutline based on fewer resources (which could have significantly reduced morale), we analyzed each initiative line-by-line and task-by-task, exploring creative solutions with partner teams to combine forces or make ownership adjustments to pick up items falling BTL.\n\n \n\nOne highlight is our collaboration with Social that leverages their loaned headcount to provide TMT customers off-Amazon with the best offerings and most accurate representation of Amazon\u2019s catalog through Data Subscription Service. This service improves the fidelity and accuracy of ASIN attribute data while making access to core advertising product attributes easy for new opportunities to experiment and launch.\u202f \n\n \n\nThe new roadmap led to the reallocation of projects and the shifting of SDEs. For instance, the CN engineering team expanded their scope from supporting only the SEO pipeline to owning Paid initiatives and the Experimentation systems. While the overall PM/engineering management structure remains unchanged, several engineering teams have adopted new charters that will continue to be relevant in the years ahead. \n\n \n\nDespite these improvements, only 22% of our roadmap is dedicated to growth initiatives with 33% of our engineering resources allocated to KTLO and 45% allocated to OE. It was disappointing to cut $389 MM net CCP in projects with approved specs and dedicated owners, but through this process we remained focused on creative problem solving, earned trust, and grew closer as a team. \n4. 2023 Overview \n\n \nIn 2023, we remain dedicated to investing in our long-term vision as outlined in our 3YP. We started with the most business critical projects when drafting our roadmap causing 78% of our engineering resources to be largely dedicated to objective two of our 3YP: \u201cMinimize overhead while developing flexible, resilient software architecture that supports Search Marketing.\u201d These technical investments are 33% KTLO and 45% OE, with our OE initiatives deemed essential re-architecture efforts to reduce the cost to serve and streamline initiatives. Several of our engineering projects nearly pay themselves off in the first year of effort: Project Kondo\u2019s 2023 investment costs 15 eng weeks, but saves us 33 weeks of legacy upkeep and with additional work next year, it is expected to unlock $290M CCP in three years. In addition, Search Marketing Toolkit\u2019s Hydra Migration costs us 70 weeks, but saves 30 weeks in year one and 110 weeks by year three. \n\n \n\nFollowing these must-have investments, the remaining 22% of our roadmap is allocated to ensuring investment in our critical projects, such as Marketing Context Service (MCS) and the integration of Optimal Inventory Health (OIH) signals into our bidder. Through repeated emphasis on invent and simplify, we continue to have the ability to invest in other critical areas of our 3YP such as Experimentation and Profitability, and we are looking for creative solutions to continue progress in BTL items (accounting for $389M CCP) by utilizing an away-team model."}]}

My strive for innovation and a craving passion to learn more about computer hardware and electronic designs are reasons why I am aspiring to become an Electrical Engineer. And because of my passion, I believe I can be an effective Student in Human Resources for METROLINX. Being an individual who enjoys working in various environments, I aspire to get involved use my strong analytical, problem solving, and interpersonal skills in METROLINX. As a third-year Electrical Engineering student, I hope to contribute towards the success of METROLINX through my actions, academic knowledge, projects, and my work experiences. \nAs a highly dedicated student that is well- accomplished in the fields of customer service and communication capabilities and proficient to the world of technology and administration, I strongly believe that I will have a positive impact towards your company. This is shown though my 4 years of experience as a Retail Associate at McDonalds, 10+ months of experiences as an Administrative Assistant and Support, and through my previous extracurricular experiences. Working at McDonalds helped me develop my coordination and teamworking skills in a fast- paced work environment. My friendly demeanor, coupled with my multitasking abilities, helped me to communicate with customers effectively while placing their orders and cash handling correctly. Moreover, learning to incorporate my organizational and computational skills as an Administrative Assistant and Support help me familiarize myself with reconciling data and organizing it in MS Excel. I strongly believe that my interpersonal and technical skills make me an ideal candidate for the position of Summer Student in Human Resources at METROLINX.\nMy academic background at Toronto Metropolitan University has been a balanced mix of design projects and theories in which I challenged myself daily to learn about algorithms, data structures, electronics circuit systems and object-oriented engineering analysis and design. During my CPS125 Digital Computation and Programming course, I led a group of 5 students in analyzing and creating unique algorithms to solve large information filling systems problems. I was responsible in facilitating team meetings, completing the final project report, and assisting with research and developing a binary search algorithm to satisfy specific conditions provided by the problem. This 4-week project provided me with the opportunity to work with a group of like-minded individuals and utilize my analytical skills to solve problems and showcase my project management skills. During the quarantine in 2021, I took the initiative to complete the CS50 Series Course by Harvard University to learn various programing languages. Using the knowledge from this course, I was able to develop my own version of Black- Jack, Tic Tac Toe, and Hangman using Java and Python. During the winter 2022 semester, I was able to develop a merge sort algorithm (garbage collection included) with C using the knowledge learned from data structures and linked lists.\nThanks to my academic background in electronics and my hands on experience using lab hardware such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers, knowledge regarding analog/digital circuit analysis, reading schematics, software architecture, design and debugging, concept regarding power and performance are a few things I crave to learn more about. Additionally, being part of Toronto Met Formula Racing gave me an insight into hardware engineering and gaining technical experience by engaging with other sub-team members within the electrical drivetrain sub-team.\nOverall, I am confident that I will easily transition into the Summer Student role for Human Resources and effectively contribute to the team at METROLINX. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you personally and arrange a time to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your time and consideration. You may contact me though my phone number, 647-717-5780 and my personal email, aman.ayaz44@gmail.com. \nJob Description: \n\nTeamwork: You\u2019ll work closely with others and coordinate a portfolio of projects from end-to-end\nProject Coordination \u2013 Support your Project Managers throughout all phases of the project management lifecycle.

It measures the probability that a random paper in one journal has more citations than a random paper in another journal, with 50% indicating that the two journals perform equally well. Unlike the journal impact factor (IF), which is based on the number of citations received by a journal's articles in a given year divided by the total number of articles published in the two preceding years, the citation success index depends on the broadness and the shape of citation distributions. It is a relatively tight function of the ratio of IFs of journals being compared, with the citation success index growing slowly as a function of IF ratio. The lognormal distribution of citation counts is the reason for the relation between Impact Factors and Citation Success Index [[1, 2018, Shen and Wu](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e3cb33e592162e469fd902b47e5ad0c1572080c)].

{"timestamp": 4745, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 874, "Output Length": 590, "prompt": "Rewrite this literature review to include the inclusion and exclusion criteria above. Everything else stays the same including all the references already used in the following:\n- Compassion fatigue (CF) is a state of physical and mental exhaustion caused by extended exposure to the suffering of patients (P\u00e9rez-Garca et al., 2021). It is an essential issue in nursing because it can affect nurses' well-being, job performance, and quality of patient care (Peters, 2018). In nursing, nurses are supposed to care for patients while preserving their health. However, the high demands and emotional toll of nursing practice can lead to CF (Figley, 2017). Nurses and healthcare professionals in other sectors, such as social work, psychotherapy, counselling, and other caregiving professions, also experience CF (Salmond et al., 2019).\n- Studies indicate that up to 80% of nurses report CF symptoms, indicating that the prevalence of CF among nurses is significant (Xie et al., 2021). The high CF symptoms have important implications for nurses' health and the quality of patient care. Nurses with CF may experience reduced empathy towards patients, which can negatively affect the quality of care provided (Anshel & Kaplowitz, 2018). In addition, nurses with CF may face elevated rates of burnout, depression, anxiety, and physical ailments (Jasper et al., 2016; Kayser-Jones et al., 2018). The negative impacts of CF can lead to poor job performance and a higher risk of turnover, which can negatively impact the healthcare system.\n- CF is also a significant concern regarding nursing staff retention and turnover. Studies indicate that nurses with CF are more likely to abandon the field, resulting in a nursing shortage (Shanafelt et al., 2016). Staff retention and turnover are significant concerns because the need for nurses is rising due to an ageing population and the rise of chronic diseases. In addition, nurses with CF may suffer decreased job satisfaction and engagement, resulting in inferior patient care (Anshel & Kaplowitz, 2018).\n- The emotional and physical long-term effects of CF on nurses have yet to be adequately researched. While studies have indicated that nurses with CF face high rates of burnout, depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms, little is known about CF's long-term mental and physical health effects. This knowledge gap justifies the proposed research question: What are the long-term consequences of CF on the mental and physical health of the UK nursing workforce? \n- In addition to the negative impacts on the well-being of nurses and the quality of patient care, CF can also have financial implications for healthcare organisations. Nurses with CF may require more frequent sick leave, which can lead to increased costs for the organisation. In addition, the high turnover rates of nurses with CF can increase recruitment and training expenses. By preventing and controlling CF, healthcare organisations can improve the well-being of their workforce and the quality of treatment offered and realise long-term cost savings. \n- The proposed research uses a mixed-methods??? approach to examine the long-term effects of CF on the mental and physical health of the nursing workforce in the United Kingdom. It will adhere to the National Health Service (NHS) and Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) ethical criteria (Pehlivan and G\u00fcner, 2020).\n- In addition, the planned research will investigate the causes and effects of CF from the perspective of nurses to better understand the underlying variables that contribute to CF and its influence on the lives of nurses. By understanding the causes and consequences of CF, healthcare organisations and policymakers can develop more effective interventions and policies to support nurses in preventing and managing CF. The findings of this study will also benefit nurses, as it will give them a better understanding of the impact CF has on their well-being and how they can mitigate the effects.\n- The proposed research will contribute to the existing literature on compassion fatigue in nursing by concentrating on CF's long-term mental and physical health effects on the UK nursing workforce. The research results will benefit nursing organisations, policymakers, and nurses in developing effective interventions and policies to support nurses in preventing and managing CF."}]}

This person is interested in getting decision makers in sectors related to the food manufacturing industry to invest in the development of this technology. \n\nPlease read the following text.

Rueda, Maria A. Morales, Mary J. Arias and Alicia Porras. Published in Polymers 2022, 14, 748.\n\nThis is the abstract of the article: \u201cAgroindustrial wastes are a cheap and abundant source of natural fibers and macromolecules that can be used in the manufacturing of biocomposites. This study presents the development and thermo-mechanical characterization of a bio-composite film (TPF/PF), made of thermoplastic banana flour (TPF) matrix and plantain fibers (PF). Fabricated materials were characterized by physical analysis, chemical composition, Fourier-transformed spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA), mechanical analysis, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The physical analysis showed that TPF and PF have a low density and high affinity to water resulting in a lightweight, renewable, and biodegradable TPF/PF composite. The chemical composition and spectra analysis of the fiber showed that PF is a potential candidate for reinforcing composites due to its high \u03b1-cellulose and low lignin content. The thermal analysis determined that TPF degrades at a lower temperature than PF, therefore the matrix sets the processing temperature for TPF/PF composite films. The mechanical test showed an improvement in the tensile properties of the composite in comparison to neat TPF. Tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus were improved by 345% and 1196%, respectively, when PF fibers was used. Good bonding and mechanical interlocking of PF to the TPF were identified by SEM. Therefore, potential biocomposites can be developed using natural fibers and thermoplastic starches obtained from plantain agroindustrial wastes.\u201d\n\nAfter reading the text, please tell me 10 different potential uses of this technology as a source of value-added products to be used by commercial firms, individual consumers or other buyers."}]}

Without immediate and aggressive intervention, he said, \u201clearning loss will be the longest-lasting and most inequitable legacy of the pandemic.\u201d\n\n\"A separate review of test scores from 2.1 million students in the United States highlighted the impacts of economic disparity. Students at schools in communities with high poverty levels spent more of the 2020-2021 school year learning remotely than those at schools in wealthier communities did, and students in poorer schools experienced steeper declines in performance when they were remote.\"\n\n\u201cA kid\u2019s ability to learn and a teacher\u2019s ability to teach are shaped by so many factors beyond just whether they\u2019re physically in the building,\u201d Mr. Reardon said. \u201cIf everyone had fallen behind equally, all at once, it presumably wouldn\u2019t affect your chance of getting into college. But when the effect is differential, that could exacerbate inequality into adulthood for the whole generation. That\u2019s worrisome on a global level.\u201d\n\nAt $611 A Day Per Student, Some Question If L.A. Schools\u2019 Extra Learning Days Are Worth It: Via the LA Times\n\n\"This education booster shot came at considerable expense \u2014 about $611 per day per student for up to two added \u201cacceleration days.\u201d That same cost, multiplied over a 180-day school year, would total about $110,000 per student. By comparison, next year\u2019s record state education funding will provide $23,723 per public school student.\"\n\n\"The bonus schooling on Dec. 19 and 20 cost $36 million. After a heavy promotional push, about 17% of the district\u2019s 422,276 students signed up; however, less than 9%, or 36,486 showed up, according to newly released data.\"\n\n\"Other problems emerged. Some teachers complained they were unable to plan effectively because they did not have advance access to rosters and student data. Under the plan, students were divided by groups into those who needed to catch up and those who would receive enrichment.\"\n\nCovid Research\nAnnual COVID-19 Booster? FDA Cliff Notes: Via Katelyn Jetelina\n\n\"The CDC presented data that is not surprising: most hospitalizations and deaths occur among older adults. Interestingly, children under 6 months are being hospitalized at about the same rates as those aged 50-64 years. This highlights the importance of maternal vaccination during pregnancy.\"\n\n\"The bivalent vaccines are working well. Adults who received a bivalent booster had 3 times lower risk of hospitalization and 2 times lower risk of dying compared to those who were vaccinated but did not get the bivalent booster. Both were more effective than no vaccination.\"\n\n\"Moderna surprised us today with new data, though: a randomized trial in the U.K. They randomly gave people the original vaccine or the bivalent vaccine (BA.1 formula) as a booster. The bivalent vaccine did better. This really put the debate to rest.\"\n\n\"I was excited to see Novavax data. It\u2019s clear this is a solid vaccine. And their presentation was much more useful than Moderna\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s. To demonstrate, they included data on mixing Novavax with mRNA vaccines. It looks like no matter how you mix the two, the combinations work about the same way.\"\n\n\"FDA proposes scientists meet in June for strain selection for a annual September vaccine roll-out. This timeline is possible for mRNA vaccines; not for Novavax. So I\u2019m not sure what FDA is going to do about that.\"\n\n\"A common theme throughout the pandemic FDA meetings is that \u201cit\u2019s too hard to measure anything other than antibodies\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t have the data needed to make a decision.\u201d The FDA could require sponsors to do detailed investigations, e.g. assessing lymph nodes, bone marrow, and breakthroughs. This would help us understand immunity better, so we can make better recommendations. It\u2019s not clear why they aren\u2019t pushing for this.\"\n\nFederal Panel Approves Plans to Safeguard Lab-Made Virus Research: Via Stat.\n\n\"A panel of federal advisers voted unanimously Friday to advance a set of proposals to bolster government oversight of pathogen research that could make viruses more transmissible.\"\n\n\"The panel\u2019s draft report, which recommends safeguards including \u201cfederal department-level review\u201d of gain-of-function studies and implementing a broader definition of pathogens that could potentially cause pandemics, will be finalized, then sent to top National Institutes of Health officials, which currently do not include a permanent NIH director or a replacement for National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci.\"\n\nFacing the New Covid-19 Reality: Via NEJM perspective:\n\n\"Covid-19 has, for many people, become no more than an occasional inconvenience, involving a few days of symptoms and a short isolation period.\" \n\n\"The reality, however, would starkly contradict such a belief. Covid-19 currently results in about 300 to 500 deaths per day in the United States \u2014 equivalent to an annual mortality burden higher than that associated with a bad influenza season.\"\n\n\"In addition, many people continue to face severe short- or long-term Covid-19 illness, including people who lack access to vaccines or treatment and those with underlying conditions that impair their immune response to vaccines or render them especially vulnerable to Covid-associated complications.\"\n\n\"The ever-looming threat of the evolution of a new variant, one that can evade our vaccines and antivirals, remains very real.\"\n\n\"One of the key challenges that the public health community faces as the pandemic evolves is the need to move away from universal recommendations, or population-wide prevention policy, toward a more differentiated or tailored approach \u2014 one that takes into account the characteristics of various communities and the pathogen.\"\n\n\"Most important, attention to the engagement of trusted community leaders and spokespeople is required, as is listening authentically to communities from the start. Rather than focusing solely on what is being recommended, it\u2019s equally important for public health leaders to focus on how recommendations are communicated and disseminated.\""}]}

{"timestamp": 4936, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 764, "Output Length": 677, "prompt": "Topic: Points, Lines, and Planes\nExplanation: In geometry, points are considered to have no size and are used to represent locations in space. Lines are collections of points that extend indefinitely in two directions, and can be described using two points or a point and a direction. Planes are flat surfaces that extend indefinitely in all directions.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe distance formula between two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), is given by d = \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). For example, the distance between (2, 3) and (6, 8) is \u221a((6 - 2)^2 + (8 - 3)^2) = \u221a(16 + 25) = \u221a41.\n\nTopic: Angles and Measurement\nExplanation: Angles are formed by two rays that have a common endpoint, called the vertex. Angles can be measured in degrees or radians, with a full circle being 360 degrees or 2\u03c0 radians.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe formula for converting degrees to radians is given by radians = (degrees \\* \u03c0) / 180. For example, 90 degrees is equal to (90 \\* \u03c0) / 180 = \u03c0 / 2 radians.\n\nTopic: Congruent and Similar Figures\nExplanation: Congruent figures are figures that have the same size and shape. Similar figures are figures that have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size.\nFormula and example:\n\nTwo triangles are similar if and only if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding side lengths are proportional. For example, two triangles with angles measuring 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 degrees respectively are similar, even though they are different in size.\n\nTopic: Perimeter, Area, and Volume\nExplanation: Perimeter is the distance around a figure, while area is the measure of the amount of space inside a figure. Volume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional figure.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is given by A = (base \\* height) / 2. For example, the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 7 units is (5 \\* 7) / 2 = 17.5 square units.\n\nTopic: Proofs\nExplanation: Proofs are logical arguments used to establish the truth of mathematical statements. In geometry, proofs often involve using axioms and theorems to deduce new statements about figures.\nFormula and example:\n\nA proof that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nGiven: Triangle ABC\n\nProve: \u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = 180\u00b0\n\nStep 1: Draw a straight line from point A to point C, and label it line segment AC.\nStep 2: Draw a straight line from point C to point B, and label it line segment CB.\nStep 3: Observe that line segments AC and CB form a straight line, meaning that they form a straight angle (180\u00b0).\nStep 4: By definition, the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to the sum of the angles in a straight line (180\u00b0).\nStep 5: Therefore, \u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = \u2220ACB = 180\u00b0, and the proof is complete.\n\nThis is a brief summary of some of the topics typically covered in high school geometry, including points, lines"}]}

I apologize if I gave the impression that CART is always more accurate than live closed captioning.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that CART services are often provided in more controlled environments, such as classrooms or meetings, where the speaker is typically speaking at a slower pace and the CART provider has a better opportunity to familiarize themselves with the subject matter and vocabulary being used. This can help to improve the accuracy of the captions.\n\nIn addition, CART providers typically work one-on-one with the individual or in small groups, which allows for greater customization and individualization of the captions. The CART provider can work closely with the individual to clarify any confusion or ask for clarification, which can help to improve the accuracy of the captions.\n\nThat being said, the accuracy of both live closed captioning and CART services is largely dependent on the skill and experience of the captioner or CART provider, as well as the quality of the audio and technical equipment being used.

{"timestamp": 5132, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 365, "Output Length": 16, "prompt": "Section 6: The Role of Mindfulness in Stress Management\n\nOne effective way to manage stress is through the practice of mindfulness. Mindfulness involves being fully present in the moment and non-judgmentally accepting one's thoughts and feelings. It has been found to be effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nIn terms of managing back pain, mindfulness can be especially helpful. Chronic pain often leads to negative thoughts and emotions, which can exacerbate the pain and create a cycle of suffering. By practicing mindfulness, individuals can learn to observe their pain without judgment, allowing them to break free from this cycle and better manage their pain.\n\nOne mindfulness technique that has been found to be effective for managing back pain is body scan meditation. This involves systematically focusing on different parts of the body and observing any sensations without judgment. By doing so, individuals can learn to identify areas of tension or pain in their body and work to release it through techniques such as deep breathing or relaxation exercises.\n\nAnother mindfulness technique that can be helpful for managing stress and back pain is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) therapy. This program involves mindfulness meditation, yoga, and body awareness training. It has been found to be effective in reducing pain and improving quality of life in individuals with chronic pain conditions.\n\nIn addition to these specific techniques, incorporating mindfulness into daily life can also help reduce stress and manage back pain. This can involve simple practices such as paying attention to the breath while walking, taking breaks to stretch and move throughout the day, and practicing gratitude and kindness towards oneself and others.\n\nOverall, mindfulness can be a powerful tool for managing stress and back pain. By learning to be present in the moment and accepting one's thoughts and feelings, individuals can reduce stress and pain, improve quality of life, and cultivate a greater sense of well-being."}]}

Acidic: This Amplified has the ability to spit corrosive acid at the player, causing damage over time and eating away at their armor. The acid could also be used to melt through certain obstacles or barriers in the environment, creating new pathways for the player to explore.\n2. Infector: This Amplified has a unique strain of the parasite that can infect other zombies in the area, causing them to mutate and become even more dangerous. The player would need to take out the Infector quickly before it has a chance to spread its infection too far.\n3. Crawler: This Amplified is similar to the Hydra in that it has multiple heads, but instead of being attached to a single body, each head is connected to its own small, spider-like body. These Crawlers can scuttle along walls and ceilings, making it difficult for the player to keep track of them.\n4. Berserker: This Amplified has a greatly enhanced strength and agility, but is also extremely reckless and prone to charging headfirst into danger. The Berserker could be used as a kind of \"mini-boss\" encounter, where the player has to carefully dodge and counter its attacks while dealing enough damage to take it down.\n5. Mimic: This Amplified has the ability to disguise itself as a regular object in the environment (such as a trash can or piece of furniture), only revealing itself as a zombie when the player gets too close. This could create a lot of tension and paranoia as the player never knows what might be lurking around the next corner."}]}

If you set `random_state` to a fixed value, like 42, `train_test_split` will always generate the same random splits for the same input data. This is useful for getting consistent results each time you run your code.\n\nHere's an example code that demonstrates this:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create some input data\nX = np.arange(100).reshape((50, 2))\ny = np.arange(50)\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets with random_state=42\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Print the training and testing sets\nprint(\"Training data:\\n\", X_train, y_train)\nprint(\"Testing data:\\n\", X_test, y_test)\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets again with random_state=42\nX_train2, X_test2, y_train2, y_test2 = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Print the training and testing sets\nprint(\"Training data:\\n\", X_train2, y_train2)\nprint(\"Testing data:\\n\", X_test2, y_test2)\n```\nIn this example code, we generate some input data and use `train_test_split` to split it into training and testing sets with `test_size=0.2` and `random_state=42`. We then print the resulting training and testing sets. We then call `train_test_split` again with the same input data and the same `test_size` and `random_state` parameters, and print the resulting training and testing sets again.\n\nIf you run this code, you will see that the two sets of training and testing data are identical.

It is Malar, the Beastlord, who has come to claim his due.\n\nMalar's eyes fall on Bearach, and he senses the dragonborn's fear and uncertainty. The deity approaches Bearach, and in a voice that echoes like thunder, he says, \"You have a strong connection to the primal forces of the world, dragonborn. Why do you resist the call of the hunt? Why do you fear the bestial instinct that courses through your veins?\"\n\nBearach stands his ground, but he is trembling with fear. He knows that he is no match for Malar in a fair fight, but he also knows that he cannot let the deity sway him to his cause.

To add a new block to the blockchain, miners must solve a complex mathematical problem known as a hash puzzle. This requires significant computational power and energy consumption. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin, as well as transaction fees from the transactions included in the block.\n\nThe incentives provided by the proof-of-work mechanism are designed to encourage miners to contribute their computational power to the network, in order to validate transactions and maintain the security of the blockchain. By providing a financial reward for solving the hash puzzle, miners have an incentive to invest in expensive computing equipment and to compete with each other to be the first to solve the puzzle.\n\nIn addition to the financial rewards, miners also play an important role in securing the network. By validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, miners ensure that the network is decentralized and resistant to attacks. This is because in order to alter the blockchain, an attacker would need to control a majority of the computing power on the network, which is known as a 51% attack. The cost of acquiring such a large amount of computing power would be prohibitively expensive, making the network highly secure.\n\nOverall, the concept of incentives and proof of work in Bitcoin are designed to create a decentralized and secure network that is resistant to attacks and can be trusted to process transactions. By providing financial rewards for miners and encouraging them to compete with each other, the network is able to maintain its integrity and ensure that transactions are validated in a secure and efficient manner."}]}

Simple prototypes may be relatively inexpensive to create, while more complex prototypes may require more resources and time. Ultimately, the benefits of prototyping must be weighed against the costs in order to determine whether it is a worthwhile investment for a particular project."}]}

The `std::iter_swap` function takes two iterators as its arguments, and it swaps the values at the positions pointed to by the iterators. The returned objects from the `begin()` and `end()` functions in the iterator class, need to be able to act as iterators and should have the following properties:\n\n* They should be copyable\n* They should be comparable with `==` and `!=`\n* They should be dereferenceable with `*`\n* They should be incremented with `++`\n* They should be swapped with `std::swap`\n\nAs long as the returned objects from the `begin()` and `end()` functions in the iterator class have those properties, they can be used as arguments to the `std::iter_swap` function.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that returning by value can have some performance implications, as it can lead to unnecessary copies of the iterators, especially when the iterators are used in tight loops.

In general, fluctuations in physical systems can be caused by various factors, such as random fluctuations in temperature or the presence of external noise.\n\nTo prove that the rate of change in a physical system does not fluctuate, it is necessary to perform measurements that are precise enough to detect any small fluctuations, and to control or eliminate any external sources of noise that could affect the measurements. For example, in the case of the cesium 133 atom, which is used to define the second, the measurement of the transitions between the hyperfine levels of the ground state must be performed in a highly controlled environment, such as a vacuum chamber, to minimize any effects of external noise.\n\nIn addition to precise measurements, it is also important to have a well-understood theoretical model of the physical system. This allows for a precise prediction of the expected rate of change, and for the identification of any deviations from the expected behavior that could indicate a fluctuation in the rate of change.\n\nIn conclusion, proving that the rate of change in a physical system does not fluctuate requires precise measurements, a well-controlled experimental environment, and a well-understood theoretical model of the system. The accuracy of the measurements and the consistency of the results must be carefully validated to establish confidence in the conclusion that the rate of change does not fluctuate."}]}

Stomach: The stomach is where ethanol is first introduced, and its absorption rate is determined by the ke function, which depends on the initial dose of ethanol.\n2. Central Compartment: This compartment represents the bloodstream and accounts for the distribution and elimination of ethanol and acetaldehyde.\n3. Muscle Compartment: This compartment models ethanol and acetaldehyde exchange between the central compartment and the muscle tissue.\n4. Liver Compartment: The liver is modeled as a plug flow reactor (PFR) and is divided into multiple sub-compartments. It accounts for the metabolism of ethanol into acetaldehyde and the subsequent conversion of acetaldehyde into acetate.\n5. Gastrointestinal Tract: This compartment represents the absorption of ethanol and acetaldehyde from the central compartment.\n\nNow, we can start integrating the enzyme addition feature into the 5-compartment model. We'll need to modify the mass balance equations for the central compartment to account for the added enzyme.

For example, MIS can be used to analyze sales data to identify the most popular products and customer preferences, which can be used to make informed marketing decisions.\n2. Decision Support:\nMIS provides decision support to managers by providing relevant and timely information. The information provided includes reports, dashboards, and analytics that help managers to make informed decisions. For example, MIS can provide a report on inventory levels, which can help managers to make purchasing decisions, thus avoiding stockouts or overstocking.\n3. Planning and Forecasting:\nMIS can be used for planning and forecasting activities. It provides managers with historical data and projections that can be used to make future plans. For example, MIS can provide projections on future sales and revenue, which can be used to make decisions on production capacity and staffing requirements.\n4. Communication and Collaboration:\nMIS facilitates communication and collaboration among different departments and stakeholders in an organization. The system provides a platform for sharing information, feedback, and ideas. For example, MIS can be used to collaborate on projects, share files, and track progress.\n5. Monitoring and Control:\nMIS helps managers to monitor and control activities within the organization. It provides alerts and notifications on exceptions and deviations from planned activities. For example, MIS can be used to monitor employee performance, identify areas of improvement, and provide feedback to employees.\n\nIn conclusion, MIS plays a crucial role in organizational decision-making by providing managers with relevant and timely information. It helps managers to make informed decisions that can impact the organization's performance. MIS provides decision support, planning and forecasting, communication and collaboration, monitoring and control, and data collection and analysis, which are essential for effective decision-making. Organizations that invest in MIS can gain a competitive advantage by making informed decisions based on data-driven insights."}]}

{"timestamp": 6100, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 422, "Output Length": 23, "prompt": "Arrow functions do have a `this` keyword, but they behave differently than regular functions when it comes to `this` binding.\n\nIn a regular function, the value of `this` is determined by how the function is called. If the function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to that object. If the function is called as a standalone function, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js) in non-strict mode or `undefined` in strict mode.\n\nIn contrast, arrow functions do not have their own `this` binding. Instead, they inherit the `this` value from the surrounding lexical scope, which is the closest parent function that has its own `this` keyword. In other words, the value of `this` in an arrow function is determined by the context in which it is defined, not how it is called.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate the difference:\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  name: 'Alice',\n  greet: function() {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`); // regular function, this refers to obj\n  },\n  greetArrow: () => {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`); // arrow function, this refers to the global object (window or global)\n  }\n};\n\nobj.greet(); // logs \"Hello, Alice!\"\nobj.greetArrow(); // logs \"Hello, undefined!\"\n```\nIn this example, `obj` has two methods, `greet` and `greetArrow`. `greet` is a regular function that uses `this` to access the `name` property of `obj`. `greetArrow` is an arrow function that also tries to use `this` to access the `name` property of `obj`. However, since arrow functions do not have their own `this` binding, `this` in `greetArrow` refers to the global object (`window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js), not `obj`."}]}

You are correct that the `oauth2Permissions` property is used in the Azure AD application manifest to define permissions for the application.\n\nWhen you define an app role in the Azure AD application manifest, you can define one or more `oauth2Permissions` objects that represent the permissions associated with the app role. Each `oauth2Permissions` object contains properties such as `id`, `type`, `value`, and `adminConsentDescription`, which define the details of the permission.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define an `oauth2Permissions` object for an app role in the application manifest:\n```json\n\"appRoles\": [\n  {\n    \"allowedMemberTypes\": [\n      \"User\"\n    ],\n    \"description\": \"Read access to Page1\",\n    \"displayName\": \"Page1 Readers\",\n    \"id\": \"e7d262d2-17df-4268-8c08-7d21b9eac2b1\",\n    \"isEnabled\": true,\n    \"value\": \"Page1_Readers\",\n    \"oauth2Permissions\": [\n      {\n        \"adminConsentDescription\": \"Allows the application to read Page1 on your behalf\",\n        \"adminConsentDisplayName\": \"Read access to Page1\",\n        \"id\": \"9c9ef6b7-6b10-4932-9c90-2bdf47a85f1f\",\n        \"isEnabled\": true,\n        \"type\": \"User\",\n        \"userConsentDescription\": \"Allow the application to read Page1 on your behalf\",\n        \"userConsentDisplayName\": \"Read access to Page1\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\nIn this example, the `oauth2Permissions` property contains one `oauth2Permissions` object that defines the \"read\" permission for the \"Page1 Readers\" app role. The `id` property is a unique identifier for the permission, and the `type` property is set to `User`, which indicates that this permission is granted to individual users.\n\nWhen you use the `CustomAuthorizationMiddleware` in your ASP.NET MVC Core application, you can check whether a user has the required app role and permission to access a specific page or control. For example, you might check whether the user has the \"Page1 Readers\" app role and the \"read\" permission to access the Page1 page in your application."}]}

{"timestamp": 6580, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 551, "Output Length": 17, "prompt": "To perform hypothesis testing on the car prices, we can use the t-test. The t-test is used to determine if the means of two groups are significantly different from each other. In this case, we can use the t-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean car price of cars with manual and automatic transmission.\n\nFirst, we need to create two groups of car prices based on the transmission type. We can use the `groupby()` method to group the data by transmission type, and then calculate the mean car price for each group using the `mean()` method.\n```python\nmanual_cars = df_filtered[df_filtered['transmission'] == 'Manual']\nauto_cars = df_filtered[df_filtered['transmission'] == 'Automatic']\n\nmanual_mean = manual_cars['price'].mean()\nauto_mean = auto_cars['price'].mean()\n\nprint('Manual mean price:', manual_mean)\nprint('Automatic mean price:', auto_mean)\n```\nOutput:\n```yaml\nManual mean price: 11440.529741863116\nAutomatic mean price: 13692.074979642342\n```\nWe can see that the mean car price for automatic cars is higher than that of manual cars. Now, we can use the t-test to determine if this difference is statistically significant. We can use the `ttest_ind()` function from the `scipy.stats` module to perform the t-test. This function takes two arrays of values and returns the t-statistic and the p-value.\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\nt_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(manual_cars['price'], auto_cars['price'], equal_var=False)\n\nprint('T-statistic:', t_stat)\nprint('P-value:', p_value)\n```\nOutput:\n```makefile\nT-statistic: -9.134290873691375\nP-value: 1.1462753861932673e-19\n```\nThe t-statistic measures the difference between the means of the two groups relative to the variation within the groups. The p-value is the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as the one we calculated if the null hypothesis (that the means are equal) is true. In this case, the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, which is the typical threshold for statistical significance.

Gene therapy: Gene therapy involves the use of genes, or the instructions contained within DNA, to treat or prevent disease. Some research suggests that gene therapy may have anti-aging effects by targeting and repairing specific genes that are associated with aging and age-related diseases.\n2. Senolytic drugs: Senolytic drugs are compounds that are specifically designed to target and eliminate senescent cells, which are cells that are no longer able to divide and are thought to contribute to the aging process. Some research suggests that senolytic drugs may have anti-aging effects by removing senescent cells and improving overall health.\n3. DNA damage repair therapies: DNA damage repair therapies involve the use of drugs or other compounds to repair damage to DNA that can occur as a result of aging or environmental factors. Some research suggests that DNA damage repair therapies may have anti-aging effects by preventing or repairing DNA damage and reducing the risk of age-related diseases.\n4. Caloric restriction mimetic drugs: Caloric restriction mimetic drugs are compounds that mimic the effects of caloric restriction, which is the practice of reducing daily caloric intake in order to extend lifespan and delay the onset of age-related diseases. Some research suggests that caloric restriction mimetic drugs may have anti-aging effects by activating cellular pathways that promote longevity.\n5. Mitochondrial dysfunction therapies: Mitochondrial dysfunction is a condition in which the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures in cells, do not function properly. Some research suggests that therapies that target mitochondrial dysfunction may have anti-aging effects by improving energy metabolism and reducing the risk of certain diseases.\n6. Epigenetic therapies: Epigenetic therapies involve the use of drugs or other compounds to modify the expression of genes, or the process by which the instructions contained within DNA are used to produce proteins and other molecules. Some research suggests that epigenetic therapies may have anti-aging effects by modifying the expression of genes that are associated with aging and age-related diseases.\n7. Anti-inflammatory therapies: Chronic inflammation has been linked to a number of age-related diseases, including heart disease and certain cancers. Some research suggests that therapies that target inflammation may have anti-aging effects by reducing inflammation and improving overall health.\n8. Antioxidant therapies: Antioxidants are substances that protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can damage cells and contribute to the aging process. Some research suggests that therapies that increase antioxidant levels in the body may have anti-aging effects by protecting cells from damage and reducing the risk of age-related diseases.\n9. Telomere-stabilizing therapies: Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that shorten as we age. Some research suggests that therapies that stabilize telomeres may have anti-aging effects by slowing down the aging process.\n10. Autophagy-promoting therapies: Autophagy is the process by which cells break down and recycle their own damaged or unnecessary components. Some research suggests that therapies that promote autophagy may have anti-aging effects by removing damaged or unnecessary cellular components and improving overall health.\n11. Microbiome therapies: The microbiome is the collection of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that live in and on the body. Some research suggests that therapies that target the microbiome may have anti-aging effects by improving the balance of beneficial bacteria and reducing inflammation.\n12.

{"timestamp": 6623, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 365, "Output Length": 15, "prompt": "Attaching the event listener to the parent element and using event delegation to listen for clicks on the button is a better option as it allows you to handle events on elements that do not exist yet on the page at the time the JavaScript is executed.\n\nEvent delegation works by attaching an event listener to a parent element, and then using the event object to determine which child element was actually clicked on. When an event occurs on an element inside the parent element, it will bubble up the DOM tree and reach the parent element. The event listener on the parent element can then examine the event object to determine which child element was actually clicked on.\n\nTo implement event delegation in your code, you can attach the event listener to the parent element (in this case, the element that contains all 5 buttons) instead of each button. Then in the event listener function, you can use the event object's `target` property to determine which button was actually clicked on. For example:\n```javascript\nconst parentElement = document.querySelector('.rating-stars');\nparentElement.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n  if (event.target.matches('.rating-stars button')) {\n    // do something with the button that was clicked\n  }\n});\n```\nThis way, you can use the same event listener function for all buttons, regardless of whether they currently exist on the page or not, and you can use the `event.target` property to determine which button was actually clicked on.\n\nRegarding the if statement, you can use event.target.classList.contains(\"star-fill-100\") check if the star is filled or not. Based on this you can decide whether to update the rating with the value or null.\n\nYou can re-attach the event listener after updating the class of the button, but that could be less efficient compared to the event delegation approach."}]}

From the spices used to the cooking techniques employed, food is one of the most important ways in which culture is expressed. In this blog post, we will explore the culinary traditions of ten different countries, from the staple foods to the key dishes of different courses.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n--------------\n\nThe United Kingdom, which comprises Scotland, Wales, England, and Ireland, has a rich culinary heritage influenced by its colonial past. Lard is a predominant cooking medium, while pies and pastries are popular. Sausages like Haggis are widespread, and alcoholic spirits are predominantly used as an aid to cooking. The staple foods of the UK include offal, meat, milk, vegetables like leeks, onions, garlic, and leeks, butter, cheese, oats, barley, and potatoes. Some of the most important dishes of different courses include fish and chips, shepherd's pie, cornish pastry, Yorkshire pudding, Welsh rarebit, roast beef, Cumberland sausage, bread and butter pudding, scones, and fruit trifle.\n\nItaly\n-----\n\nItalian cuisine is one of the most popular in the world, characterized by its use of olive oil, wine, and starch-based products like pasta, pizza, and bread. Coffee, specifically espresso, is served after meals, and Italian meals are accompanied by wine. Tomatoes, durum wheat, olive oil, cheese, meat, poultry, and herbs like basil, oregano, and thyme are some of the most important ingredients in Italian cuisine. Some of the most important dishes of different courses include minestrone, frito miso, polenta, pizza, spaghetti carbonara, tiramisu, panettone, bisttecca alla florentina, zabaglione, and ricotta gnudi.\n\nFrance\n------\n\nFrench cuisine is characterized by its finesse and attention to detail. Baked goods are widely used, and stock serves as an important base for most sauces and all soups.

One of the most notable changes is the use of chatbots, which are automated tools that can assist customers with their queries and problems. However, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are becoming smarter and more sophisticated, offering a personalized and seamless experience to customers. In this blog post, we'll explore how AI-enhanced customer service is changing the game for businesses and customers alike.\n\nWhat are Chatbots with a Brain?\n\nChatbots with a Brain refers to the use of AI-powered chatbots in customer service. These chatbots are equipped with natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms that enable them to understand and respond to customers' queries and concerns in a human-like manner. These chatbots can also learn from previous interactions and improve their responses over time, making them more effective and efficient in handling customer requests.\n\nThe Benefits of AI-Enhanced Customer Service\n\nAI-enhanced customer service has several benefits for both businesses and customers. One of the most significant advantages is the ability to offer personalized and seamless experiences to customers. With the help of AI, chatbots can analyze customer data and provide tailored recommendations and solutions, enhancing the customer experience and driving customer satisfaction.\n\nAnother significant advantage of AI-enhanced customer service is the ability to reduce wait times and handle a high volume of requests simultaneously. Chatbots can handle multiple customer requests simultaneously, ensuring that customers receive timely responses and reducing the need for human intervention.\n\nThe Challenges of AI-Enhanced Customer Service\n\nWhile AI-enhanced customer service has several benefits, there are also some challenges that businesses need to address. One of the main challenges is the potential for chatbots to lack empathy and understanding of complex customer issues. While AI algorithms can learn from previous interactions and improve their responses, they may not be able to handle complex or emotional issues that require human empathy and understanding.\n\nAnother challenge is the potential for data privacy and security issues. Chatbots collect and store customer data, raising concerns about data privacy and security. Businesses need to ensure that they have proper security measures in place to protect customer data and comply with data protection regulations.\n\nThe Future of AI-Enhanced Customer Service\n\nAs businesses continue to invest in AI-enhanced customer service, the role of chatbots with a Brain will only continue to grow. Businesses that are able to successfully leverage AI technology to enhance their customer service capabilities will be well-positioned to gain a competitive edge in the market.\n\nHowever, to succeed in this space, businesses need to be aware of the limitations of chatbots with a Brain and take steps to ensure that they are still able to provide a human touch when needed. Businesses need to invest in training their customer service representatives to work alongside chatbots to provide a seamless and personalized customer experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI-enhanced customer service is transforming the way businesses interact with customers, providing a personalized and seamless experience that enhances customer satisfaction and drives business growth. With the right investment in technology and training, businesses can leverage AI to improve their customer service capabilities and gain a competitive edge in the market. The future of AI-enhanced customer service looks bright, and businesses and customers alike can look forward to an exciting new era of customer service."}]}

The model is based on dilated convolutions, which allow the receptive field to grow exponentially with the depth of the network, while keeping the computational cost constant. The model generates high-quality speech and music samples that are nearly indistinguishable from real recordings. WaveNet has been used for a variety of applications, including text-to-speech synthesis, music generation, and voice conversion.\n\nMain Architecture:\nThe main architecture of WaveNet consists of a stack of causal dilated convolutions, which operate on the raw audio waveform in an autoregressive manner. The network takes as input a sequence of raw audio samples and predicts the distribution of the next sample at each time step. The output distribution is then sampled to obtain the next sample, which is fed back into the network as input for the next time step.\n\nThe dilated convolutions in WaveNet have a special structure, where the filter weights are shared across time and across channels, but are multiplied by a different set of coefficients at each time step, determined by a set of learnable gating functions. This allows the network to capture long-range dependencies in the audio signal, while avoiding the computational cost of a fully connected network. The network also uses skip connections to bypass several layers at a time, allowing the output of one block of dilated convolutions to be added to the output of an earlier block, and fed as input to a later block.\n\nMain Code:\nHere's some sample code for a simplified version of the WaveNet architecture using Keras:\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, Multiply, Add, Activation\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n\ndef build_wavenet(input_shape, num_filters=128, num_layers=10, num_dilation_rates=3):\n    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)\n\n    # Initial convolutional layer\n    x = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=2, padding='causal')(inputs)\n\n    # Stack of dilated convolutional layers\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        for j in range(num_dilation_rates):\n            # Dilated convolutional layer with exponentially increasing dilation rate\n            dilation_rate = 2 ** j\n            x1 = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=2, padding='causal', dilation_rate=dilation_rate)(x)\n\n            # Gating function\n            x2 = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=2, padding='causal', dilation_rate=dilation_rate)(x)\n            x2 = Activation('sigmoid')(x2)\n\n            # Element-wise multiplication and addition\n            x = Multiply()([x1, x2])\n            x = Add()([x, inputs if j == 0 else skip])\n\n            # Skip connection\n            if j == num_dilation_rates - 1:\n                skip = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=1)(x)\n                inputs = skip if i == 0 else Add()([inputs, skip])\n\n    # Final convolutional and output layers\n    x = Activation('relu')(inputs)\n    x = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=1)(x)\n    x = Activation('relu')(x)\n    x = Conv1D(1, kernel_size=1)(x)\n\n    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x, name='WaveNet')\n    return model\n```\nThis code builds a WaveNet model that takes as input a sequence of raw audio samples, represented as a 1D array, and outputs a probability distribution over the next sample.

It is a modification of the traditional ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test that accounts for the possibility of cointegration between the two series.\n\nTo check for cointegration using the CADF test, we first need to test each time series for stationarity using the ADF test. If one or both series are non-stationary, we can take their first differences to make them stationary. We then regress one time series on the other using ordinary least squares (OLS) and obtain the residuals.\n\nWe then perform the CADF test on the residuals to determine if they are stationary and hence whether the two series are cointegrated.

Here are some different ways to achieve encapsulation in JavaScript:\n\n1. Using Constructor Functions: Constructor functions are functions that create and initialize objects. By defining variables within a constructor function using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords, those variables become private to that function, and cannot be accessed or modified from outside the function.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nfunction BankAccount(balance) {\n  var _balance = balance;\n\n  this.deposit = function(amount) {\n    _balance += amount;\n  };\n\n  this.withdraw = function(amount) {\n    if (amount <= _balance) {\n      _balance -= amount;\n      return true;\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n  };\n\n  this.getBalance = function() {\n    return _balance;\n  };\n}\n\nvar myAccount = new BankAccount(1000);\nmyAccount.deposit(500);\nmyAccount.withdraw(200);\nconsole.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // output: 1300\n```\nIn this example, the `BankAccount` constructor function encapsulates the balance data and the `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` functions that operate on that data.\n\n1. Using Classes: Classes in JavaScript are a newer syntax for defining objects with constructors and methods. Like constructor functions, variables defined within a class using the `let` or `const` keywords are private to that class and cannot be accessed or modified from outside the class.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nclass BankAccount {\n  constructor(balance) {\n    let _balance = balance;\n\n    this.deposit = function(amount) {\n      _balance += amount;\n    };\n\n    this.withdraw = function(amount) {\n      if (amount <= _balance) {\n        _balance -= amount;\n        return true;\n      } else {\n        return false;\n      }\n    };\n\n    this.getBalance = function() {\n      return _balance;\n    };\n  }\n}\n\nlet myAccount = new BankAccount(1000);\nmyAccount.deposit(500);\nmyAccount.withdraw(200);\nconsole.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // output: 1300\n```\nIn this example, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the balance data and the `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` methods that operate on that data.\n\n1. Using Closures: Closures are functions that have access to variables in their outer (enclosing) function scope. By defining a function that returns an object with methods that access variables in the enclosing function, those variables become private to that function and cannot be accessed or modified from outside the function.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nfunction bankAccount(balance) {\n  let _balance = balance;\n\n  function deposit(amount) {\n    _balance += amount;\n  }\n\n  function withdraw(amount) {\n    if (amount <= _balance) {\n      _balance -= amount;\n      return true;\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  function getBalance() {\n    return _balance;\n  }\n\n  return {\n    deposit: deposit,\n    withdraw: withdraw,\n    getBalance: getBalance\n  };\n}\n\nlet myAccount = bankAccount(1000);\nmyAccount.deposit(500);\nmyAccount.withdraw(200);\nconsole.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // output: 1300\n```\nIn this example, the `bankAccount` function encapsulates the balance data and the `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` functions that operate on that data.

ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models are a popular choice for time series forecasting, and they are especially useful when there is evidence of seasonality in the data.\n\nTo start with, let's plot the data to visualize the trend and seasonality, and to identify any outliers or other anomalies.\n```bash\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create a data frame with the median sale price data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  date = as.Date(c(\"2021-09-01\", \"2021-10-01\", \"2021-11-01\", \"2021-12-01\", \"2022-01-01\", \"2022-02-01\", \"2022-03-01\", \"2022-04-01\", \"2022-05-01\", \"2022-06-01\", \"2022-07-01\", \"2022-08-01\", \"2022-09-01\", \"2022-10-01\", \"2022-11-01\", \"2022-12-01\")),\n  median_price = c(503.15, 519, 528.9, 541.62, 561, 569.075, 584.52, 595.21, 602.55, 615.9, 629, 649, 654.05, 672.5, 675, 675)\n)\n\n# Plot the median sale price data\nggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = median_price)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ggtitle(\"Median Sale Price of Burpengary Property (Sep 2021 - Dec 2022)\") +\n  xlab(\"Date\") +\n  ylab(\"Median Sale Price (Thousands of Dollars)\")\n```\nBased on the plot, there seems to be an upward trend in the median sale price, with some seasonality evident in the data as well. There are no major outliers or anomalies that we need to worry about.\n\nNow, we can fit an ARIMA model to the data using the `forecast` package in R. To determine the optimal values of the ARIMA parameters (p, d, and q), we can use the `auto.arima()` function, which automatically selects the best model based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).\n```bash\nlibrary(forecast)\n\n# Fit an ARIMA model to the median sale price data\narima_model <- auto.arima(df$median_price)\n\n# Print the summary of the ARIMA model\nsummary(arima_model)\n```\nThe `auto.arima()` function has chosen an ARIMA(2,1,2) model, which means that the model includes two autoregressive terms, one differencing term, and two moving average terms.\n\nWe can now use the `forecast()` function to generate forecasts for the next few periods. For example, to generate forecasts for the next 12 months, we can use the following code:\n```python\n# Generate forecasts for the next 12 months\nforecast_values <- forecast(arima_model, h = 12)\n\n# Print the forecast values\nprint(forecast_values)\n```\nThe `forecast()` function generates forecasts for the next 12 months, along with prediction intervals for each forecast. The forecast values and prediction intervals are stored in the `forecast_values` object, which we can print to the console to see the results.\n\nI hope this helps you with your analysis of the median sale price data for Burpengary!"}]}
{"timestamp": 7462, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 807, "Output Length": 24, "prompt": "3.1. Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Retrosynthetic Analysis\n\nIn recent years, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as powerful tools to address the limitations of manual retrosynthetic analysis and traditional computational methods. These data-driven approaches can learn complex patterns and relationships from large chemical datasets, enabling more accurate and efficient predictions of retrosynthetic routes (86, 87). This section discusses the application of ML and DL in retrosynthetic analysis, highlighting key advancements and methodologies.\n\n1. Neural network models: Neural networks, particularly deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been applied to predict retrosynthetic routes by learning complex representations of molecular structures and reaction patterns (88, 89). For example, the work by Segler et al. (90) employed a combination of CNNs and RNNs to predict suitable precursors for a given target molecule.\n2. Sequence-to-sequence models: Sequence-to-sequence models, which are typically based on RNNs and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have been applied to translate molecular representations of target compounds into precursor molecules, mimicking the process of retrosynthetic disconnection (91, 92). The work by Liu et al. (93) used a sequence-to-sequence model to predict high-level disconnection patterns for a given target molecule.\n3. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs): GCNs have been used to model molecular graphs for predicting retrosynthetic routes, taking advantage of their ability to capture local and global structural features of molecules (94, 95). For instance, Coley et al. (96) developed a graph-convolutional approach to predict retrosynthetic routes by learning a continuous representation of molecular structures and reaction templates.\n4. Reinforcement learning (RL): RL techniques, such as Q-learning and deep Q-networks (DQNs), have been applied to retrosynthetic analysis by modeling the disconnection process as a decision-making problem, where the algorithm iteratively learns the optimal actions to perform at each step (97, 98). The work by Zhou et al. (99) employed a DQN-based approach to navigate the retrosynthetic tree and identify efficient synthetic routes.\n5. Transfer learning: Transfer learning techniques have been used to leverage pre-trained models and knowledge from related tasks to improve the performance of retrosynthetic analysis models, particularly when training data is limited (100, 101). The work by Schwaller et al. (102) demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning in predicting reaction templates for retrosynthetic disconnections.\n6. Multi-task learning: Multi-task learning methods, which involve training a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, have been used to improve the accuracy and generalizability of retrosynthetic analysis models by leveraging the shared knowledge between related tasks (103, 104). An example of this approach can be found in the work by Dai et al. (105), where a single model was trained to predict multiple reaction outcomes, such as yield and selectivity, in addition to retrosynthetic routes.\n\nThe application of ML and DL in retrosynthetic analysis has shown significant promise in overcoming the limitations of manual methods and traditional computational approaches, enabling the development of more accurate, efficient, and scalable tools for synthetic route prediction (106, 107).\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

{"timestamp": 7585, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 782, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "If you want to individually control access to each page and control in your ASP.NET MVC Core application, you can define each page and control as a resource and assign it a unique identifier. You can then use these identifiers in your external authorization system, such as Azure AD, to define the access policies for each resource.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define a resource in Azure AD:\n\n1. Define a resource: Define a resource in Azure AD that corresponds to a page or control in your ASP.NET MVC Core application. You can define the resource by adding a new application manifest file in the Azure Portal, and adding a new `resources` property to the manifest. The `resources` property is an array of objects that define each resource.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define a resource in the `resources` property:\n```json\n\"resources\": [\n  {\n    \"resourceAppId\": \"your-application-client-id\",\n    \"resourceAccess\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"e7d262d2-17df-4268-8c08-7d21b9eac2b1\",\n        \"type\": \"Scope\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"resourceDisplayName\": \"Page1\",\n    \"resourceName\": \"your-application-uri/page1\"\n  }\n],\n```\nIn this example, the `resources` property contains one object that defines the \"Page1\" resource. The `resourceAppId` property is the client ID of your ASP.NET MVC Core application in Azure AD, and the `resourceName` property is the URI of the protected resource.\n\n2. Assign permissions: Assign permissions to each resource in Azure AD. You can assign permissions by adding them to the `resourceAccess` property of the resource object. The `resourceAccess` property is an array of objects that define the permissions for the resource.\n\nHere's an example of how you can assign permissions to the \"Page1\" resource in the `resourceAccess` property:\n```json\n\"resourceAccess\": [\n  {\n    \"id\": \"e7d262d2-17df-4268-8c08-7d21b9eac2b1\",\n    \"type\": \"Scope\"\n  }\n],\n```\nIn this example, the `id` property is the unique identifier for the permission, and the `type` property is set to `Scope`, which indicates that this is a permission scope.\n\n3. Define policies: Define policies that determine who has access to each resource and under what conditions. You can define policies using a policy language, such as XACML or JSON-based policies, in Azure AD or an external authorization system.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define a policy in Azure AD:\n```json\n{\n  \"if\": {\n    \"allOf\": [\n      {\n        \"matches\": {\n          \"request.resource.name\": \"your-application-uri/page1\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"matches\": {\n          \"request.user.groups\": \"Page1_Readers\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"then\": {\n    \"permit\": {}\n  },\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n```\nIn this example, the policy grants access to the \"Page1\" resource if the user is a member of the \"Page1\\_Readers\" group.\n\n4. Implement policies: Once you have defined your policies, you can implement them in your ASP.NET MVC Core application using a custom authorization middleware. The middleware can intercept requests to protected resources and evaluate the user's attributes and other factors against the policies defined in the external authorization system.\n\nBy defining each page and control as a resource and assigning it a unique identifier, you can achieve fine-grained access control in your ASP.NET MVC Core application"}]}

We create a new vector layer and add your polygons to its source, and add an event listener for the `click` event on the layer.\n\nInside the event listener function, we first reset the style of the previously selected feature (if there was one) by calling `setStyle(null)` on it. We then set the style and number for the newly selected feature. We set the style using the `getStyle()` method of the vector layer, which returns the `style` option defined on the layer. We set the `selectedFeature` variable to the newly selected feature and increment the `nextNumber` variable.\n\nWe update the style of the features based on their `selectedFeature` property by using an `ol.style.Style` object. We set the default style for the polygons, and if a feature is selected, we update its style to highlight it and display the number label.\n\nFinally, we refresh the layer's source to update the styles."}]}

We store the resulting tokenized text in a list called `texts`.\n\nNext, we create a dictionary and corpus for the topic model using the `Dictionary()` and `corpora` modules from `gensim`. The `Dictionary()` method creates a mapping of words to numeric IDs, and the `doc2bow()` method converts the tokenized text to bag-of-words format.\n\nWe then train the topic model using the `LdaMulticore()` method from `gensim`, which uses a form of unsupervised learning to identify patterns in the text data and group similar articles into topics. In this example, we set the number of topics to 5.\n\nFinally, we print the top topics and their associated keywords using the `print_topics()` method of the trained model. The `num_words` argument specifies the number of top keywords to include for each topic.\n\nYou can experiment with different numbers of topics and keywords to refine the results and get more meaningful insights from the article data. Additionally, you can use other deep learning techniques such as text classification or sentiment analysis to extract more insights from the text data."}]}

{"timestamp": 7927, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1318, "Output Length": 10, "prompt": "CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n RULE #5\n Use the Power in Your Posterior\n From Jeremy\nPossibly the most overlooked bit of anatomy, for back pain, is your backside. We are talking about your butt and especially your glutes, the big muscles that constitute most of your butt. The difficulty is that, in modern times, we have mostly used our glutes to sit on. They have atrophied as a result. The use of the buttocks exclusively as a seat cushion is a recent development in evolutionary terms, and a rotten one. It is handy, lord knows, but that wasn\u2019t the original design idea, and we are paying a horrendous price for it, mostly in back pain. \nLetting your glutes go to hell in idleness (\u201cgluteal amnesia,\u201d as the great student of back pain Dr. Stuart McGill called it) is an absolutely dreadful idea. By all means, continue to sit on them. But do much, much more, too. Remember that the glutes are the biggest muscles in your body, they have serious loads to bear, and it is critical that we let them do it. Because, if we don\u2019t, our spines (and the tiny muscles around them) will carry those loads, and they are not designed for it. They protest . . . they hurt. And they will continue to hurt until you wake up your glutes and let them do their job. \nThe gluteal muscles are a group of three muscles that make up the buttocks. There are several smaller muscles back there as well, including the piriformis. They look like this (see diagram below). \nIn a healthy person, the gluteal muscles perform a bunch of important functions. Here\u2019s what they should be doing: \n\u2022 helping you to stand up and maintain erect posture \n\u2022 keeping you from falling forward when you walk or run \n\u2022 keeping your pelvis from collapsing when you are standing on one leg or walking when only one foot is in contact with the ground \n\u2022 helping you to rise from a seated position \n\u2022 helping you pick things up \n\u2022 helping you climb stairs, ski, run, row\u2014and that old favorite, make love\nGluteal Muscles\n\nAll kinds of things. Obviously, these are some of the most important things you do and these are some of the most important muscles in your body. \nWhen you let your glutes go to sleep, things get bad. They \u201cforget\u201d all those critical functions, and the muscles that take up the slack are not up to the job. As we compress the muscles (by sitting on them), nerves and blood vessels in the gluteal muscle don\u2019t work as well. Our brain literally loses its connectivity with them. The muscles, and the neural pathways, atrophy (or \u201close preference\u201d); the brain \u201cforgets\u201d them. Hence, the term gluteal amnesia. In my experience, there is a very high correlation between the glutes going to sleep and back pain. Very high.\nHere\u2019s why: When those big powerful muscles aren\u2019t doing their job, the spine takes over. It bears the brunt of the forces that the glutes are supposed to be handling and it gets overwhelmed and damaged. Instead of using those big muscles to do things like pick up your child or grandchild, you first use the tiny muscles around your spine to do them, and those muscles can\u2019t handle it. They become strained (which causes pain, all by itself) and eventually fail. Then things get quite a bit worse. When those little muscles fail, the forces that your glutes were supposed to be handling get transmitted directly onto your discs, joints, ligaments, and tendons. That is not what they are supposed to do and it causes serious problems. Conversely, those big psoas muscles get reflexively tighter, putting more pressure on the spine. Think about it: Every time you get out of a chair, pick something up, tie your shoe, or climb the stairs, you are putting a ton of pressure on your spine that it is not designed to bear. You can do it for a while. You can do almost anything for a while. But over the days, months, and years, these micro irritations add up to macro damage. Remember Chris\u2019s explanation of \u201cgeologic time\u201d? Mountains are ground down to rubble in geologic time. Your spine is ground down to rubble in your own version of geologic time, if your glutes don\u2019t do their job.\nSummary: Letting your glutes go to sleep is a terrible idea. Reversing that process and waking them up is crucial to healing back pain. Once those muscles wake up and start doing their intended work, the muscles that do the opposite motion on the joint, the psoas muscles, reflexively loosen up. If you didn\u2019t know this, don\u2019t feel bad. A lot of therapists and doctors don\u2019t know it, either. Or don\u2019t treat it effectively. Teaching you how to treat the problem effectively is one of the most important things we do in this book. \nHere\u2019s what you need to do, in three steps: Wake up your glutes, make them strong, and learn to use them at the appropriate times, as they were designed to be used. \nPART ONE: WAKING UP THE SLEEPING GIANTS\nYou tried using your glutes with the bridge exercise. Now let\u2019s try a different way to wake them up. If you had trouble with the bridge, don\u2019t worry. We will come back to that shortly. \nClamshell\nNow, on to the all-important \u201cclamshell\u201d exercise. It is critical\u2014boring and often poorly performed, but it wakes up and strengthens your glutes.\nStep 1: Lie on your side with your hips and knees bent as shown.\nStep 2: Take the thumb of your top hand and dig it inside your upper hip bone, as in the drawing. \nStep 3: Lay the four fingers of that hand across the outside of your hip, as in the picture. \nStep 4: For most of you, your middle finger (or first or third) will be lying right on the gluteal muscles we are trying to wake up. Poke your fingers in there and feel them. Reestablish that connection with your brain. Keep your fingers there.\n\nStep 5: Find your neutral spine and brace your core."}]}

System prompts the user to complete a two-factor authentication (2FA) process, which requires them to provide a second form of verification (e.g. SMS code, voice call, authentication app, etc.).\n16. System uses risk-based authentication to assess the level of risk associated with the registration based on factors such as the user's location, device, behavior, and other contextual information. If the risk level is deemed high, additional verification measures may be required (e.g. video verification, manual review, etc.).\n17. System uses machine learning fraud detection to analyze the registration information and detect patterns or anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity.\n18. If the registration information is deemed suspicious by the fraud detection system, the system flags the registration for manual review by a human fraud analyst.\n19. The human fraud analyst reviews the registration information and makes a determination as to its validity. If the registration is deemed invalid or fraudulent, the registration process is terminated. If the registration is deemed valid, the system continues to the next step.\n20. If the registration information is deemed valid, system displays a confirmation message to the user, notifying them that their digital identity has been created.\n\nNote: AI-powered identification document reading can significantly speed up the registration process and improve accuracy. However, human oversight is necessary to catch errors and ensure that fraudulent activity is detected. The specific machine learning models and OCR techniques used will depend on the type of identification documents being processed and the requirements of the particular system. Additionally, the human fraud analyst may use additional validation checks, such as contacting the user directly, to further confirm the user's identity."}]}

{"timestamp": 8100, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3502, "Output Length": 88, "prompt": "EXERCISE 2\nThe Bridge\nThe bridge accomplishes several things. It wakes up the gluteal muscles (the big muscles in your buttocks). It reinforces spinal stabilization. It builds endurance and strength in the muscles on the front and back of the core. And it is the precursor to doing a proper squat, which comes later in the book. \nDo the bridge as follows:\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Bend your knees and put your feet in a flexed position so that your heels are on the ground and the balls of your feet and toes are off of the ground as pictured.\nStep 4: Squeeze your buttocks together as if you were trying to pinch a coin between them.\n\nStep 5: Here\u2019s the tricky part: Using the glutes, lift your hips/torso off of the ground without moving your lower back. You should not articulate the spine and roll up \u201cone vertebra at a time.\u201d You want to do the opposite of that. You want to lift the torso in one solid piece while maintaining your neutral spine. No movement should take place in the lower back.\nStep 6: Hold for five to ten seconds (remember these are suggestions. Hold to your tolerance in the beginning, with ten seconds being your goal). You should feel the muscles in both sides of your buttocks working relatively equally.\nStep 7: Lower your back down to the starting position without losing your neutral spine. Again, do not articulate the spine on the way down. In other words, do not roll the spine down onto the floor one vertebra at a time.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 2 through 7, and do five to ten reps, with ten being your long-term goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Hamstring cramping. If your hamstrings cramp (the muscles that run down the underside of your thighs), gently push your feet into the floor away from you before you lift your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Knee pain. If one or both of your knees hurt, lightly press your knees outward before lifting your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Unable to maintain neutral spine. Start by trying to lift your hips/torso only an inch off the ground. Slowly progress to a full bridge over the next few weeks.\n\u2022 Unable to feel glutes working. Go to Chapter 13. Then come back and start with the following regression.\n\u2022 If your back hurts with this exercise, proceed to the Buttock Squeezes regression on the next page. Try these for a few days or weeks and then come back and try the bridge again, making sure to follow instructions meticulously. If your back still hurts, you may have a spinal condition like severe stenosis that makes you sensitive to extension in the spine. If this is the case, this exercise might not be for you.\nCommon Mistakes\nThe most common mistake for back patients with the bridge exercise is that they use their hamstrings instead of their glutes to bring the hips up into position. If your hamstrings are cramping, then you aren\u2019t using your glutes enough. Go to Chapter 13 and practice \u201cwaking up your glutes,\u201d and then come back to this exercise and try it again.\nREGRESSION\nButtock Squeezes\nIf you don\u2019t have the strength or control yet to perform a single bridge exercise properly for any amount of time, start with buttock squeezes.\n1. Lie on your back, with arms at your side, knees bent, feet hip-width apart.\n2. Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your buttocks together as if trying to squeeze a coin between them.\n4. Hold for ten seconds.\n5. Do ten reps.\nPROGRESSION\nOne-Leg Bridge\nOnce you have mastered the bridge and are able to do it with relative ease and with no discomfort in the back, you may want to progress to the one-leg bridge. You do not have to progress to this exercise. Depending on your spinal condition and your fitness level, you may not need to progress this far. This progression is for those who are reasonably fit and plan to be very active in sports, exercise, or outdoor activities.\n1. Follow all rules for the bridge.\n2. Once your hips and torso are off the ground, give extra care to make sure your core is braced as firmly as possible.\n\n3. Slowly extend one leg at the knee without letting the hips/torso drop on that side. You will feel the glutes of the other stabilizing leg kick in as you extend the leg.\n4. Hold five to ten seconds.\n5. Slowly bring the extended leg back to the bent-knee starting position. (Do not lower your hips/torso while doing this. Maintain the bridge position with a neutral spine until your foot is back on the floor.)\n6. Slowly lower your hips/torso back to the starting position on the floor without articulating the spine.\n7. On the other side, repeat Steps 1 through 6, making sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your core in place before extending the leg at the knee.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 When you go to one leg, it is easy to \u201ccock\u201d your hips to one side, to make it easier. Don\u2019t do that. Keep your thighs parallel during the whole exercise. If you can\u2019t, you aren\u2019t strong enough yet for this exercise.\n\u2022 Regarding extending the leg as you come up/bending the leg down as you go down: Make sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your spine before you try to extend the leg. Conversely, make sure you bring the leg all the way back in before coming down to the starting position.\n\u2022 Do not bring the thigh of the extended leg up. Make sure your thighs remain parallel so that you have to use the gluteal muscles to keep the pelvis stable.\nEXERCISE 3\nCrunch and Plank\nWe discuss these two exercises together because they both do a lot of the same things, and some of you will not get to the plank and that\u2019s okay. The plank will take you a bit further toward returning to strenuous activities, but the crunch is enough to get you out of pain. The purpose of the crunch and the plank is to build endurance and strength in the abdominal wall (crunch and plank) and glutes and lats (plank) and to increase spinal stability. Very few back pain sufferers are strong enough to do a plank properly in the beginning and must do crunches for a while before attempting the plank.\nCrunch\nFirst of all, this exercise is not a sit-up. Sit-ups (the traditional \u201cArmy sit-up,\u201d where you pull yourself into a full sitting position) have been proven to be very risky to the spine. They run dangerous loads through the lumbar discs. If you wanted to develop a way to herniate a disc in a lab, a sit-up would be a good candidate for it. Crunches, unlike full sit-ups, do not allow movement in the lumbar spine. Your lumbar spine stays in neutral throughout.\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Place your hands behind your head, if possible. If you can\u2019t, because of shoulder discomfort, that\u2019s okay. Find a comfortable position for your hands.\nStep 4: Gently draw your chin in toward your neck, giving yourself a \u201cdouble chin.\u201d Hold this position throughout the exercise.\nStep 5: Slowly and carefully raise your shoulder blades and head toward the ceiling an inch or two, giving a moderate squeeze in the abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your lower back. Keep a neutral spine; this will be harder than you think. Only bring your shoulders off the floor as far as you can without moving your lower back. The max distance, when you\u2019re great at it, would be no more than, say, four inches.\n\nStep 6: Hold five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nStep 7: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your lower back.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 1 through 7, for five to ten reps, with ten being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u201cMy neck hurts.\u201d First, you shouldn\u2019t be pulling your head with your arms. Your arms/hands are there only to provide a little support to your head and neck. Make sure that you pull your chin in toward your neck before initiating the exercise. This will engage your deep neck flexors that support the spine. If this does not relieve neck pain, move to the Regression.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 The most common mistake is flattening or (worse) rounding the back. It is crucial that you not make this mistake. Doing crunches while continually rounding or flattening the back will promote spinal instability, the opposite of our goal. Details matter!\n\u2022 Chin jutting. If your chin is poking out toward the ceiling with each rep, you are not stabilizing your cervical spine and your neck extensors are taking over. Make sure to draw the chin in toward your neck before each rep.\nREGRESSION\nAbdominal Contractions\nDo this exercise until you build up enough abdominal strength to accomplish the crunch.\n1. Start in the same position as for the bridge.\n2. Place one hand behind your lower back and one hand inside your front hipbone beside your navel.\n3. Squeeze your abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your back. You should feel your back being still with one hand and the abs engaging with the other hand.\n4. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n5. Repeat for several reps until fatigue sets in.\nPROGRESSION\nPlank\nOnce you have mastered the crunch and are able to do crunches with relative ease and without pain or movement in the lower back, try the plank. This is a great exercise to build increased core stability, endurance, and strength. Some of you (especially those with severe stenosis) may never be able to do a plank. That\u2019s okay. Give the plank a try, and if it doesn\u2019t work for you, stay with crunches. If you do go on to the plank, follow the directions closely; most people do this exercise incorrectly.\n\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent and palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders.\n5. Lift your knees off of the floor so you are now on your toes and forearms.\n6. \u201cTraction\u201d your forearms into the floor. In other words, press them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and down toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n\n7. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n8. Slowly put your knees back down first. Do not let your hips/pelvis go to the floor first; this would put your back into extension and may cause pain.\n9. Repeat Steps 1 through 8, for two to five reps, with five being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my lower back.\u201d Some people just can\u2019t do a plank. Even if they do it the right way, it still aggravates their back. If you can\u2019t do a plank, drop it and stick with crunches. But first, be sure that you can\u2019t do it. For example, if your lower back is hurting, try sticking your buttocks in the air a little more. It could be that your hips are sagging toward the floor, putting your back into extension. Also, make sure the core is fully engaged before moving from knees to toes. Lastly, make sure you are squeezing your buttocks, which will support the lower back. If none of that works, forget it; stick with crunches.\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my shoulders.\u201d Make sure you are tractioning your forearms down into the floor and back toward your toes. This engages the supportive muscles of the rotator cuff. If this doesn\u2019t help, try the regression that follows.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 Feet and legs are not together, which makes gluteal engagement more difficult.\n\u2022 Back is up but the hips are dropping toward the floor. This will cause back pain in people with conditions such as stenosis or facet syndrome.\n\u2022 You\u2019re forgetting to pull shoulders back and forearms into the floor with chin jutting. This will cause an increase in pressure in the shoulders and/or neck, resulting in shoulder and neck pain.\nREGRESSION\nPlank on Knees\nIf you aren\u2019t quite ready for plank but think crunch is just too easy, try this one.\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent, palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders (see illustration, for the plank).\n5. Traction your forearms into the floor, pulling them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and back toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n6. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nEXERCISE 4\nDynamic Hamstring Stretch\nCAUTION\nThis exercise may irritate symptoms of people with active radiculopathy, such as severe leg/foot pain, and numbness or tingling in the legs or feet. If you have these symptoms, start with caution; you may not be able to do this exercise. If this exercise exacerbates your leg or back symptoms, skip it for now and come back to it when the symptoms are resolved.\nThe dynamic hamstring stretch helps to improve mobility in the hips and also helps to reinforce and strengthen your ability to maintain a neutral spine while moving the legs. It also builds endurance and strength in the core.\nStep 1: Lie on your back and find neutral spine.\nStep 2: Brace the core to lock in neutral spine.\n\nStep 3: Bend one leg at the knee with your foot flat on floor. Straighten out the other leg onto the floor, with foot flexed (toes pointed up).\nStep 4: Carefully raise the straight leg without losing your neutral spine; in other words, make sure your lower back isn\u2019t flattening into the floor as your leg comes up. To check, put one of your hands underneath your lower back and feel for movement. Raise the leg only as high as you can without flattening your back into the floor. \nStep 5: Do ten to twenty repetitions on each leg. Do as many as needed to feel that you have mildly stretched your hamstrings and worked your core.\nCommon Mistake\nFlattening the back into the floor as you bring the leg up. Remember, one of the most important points of these exercises is to teach you neutral spine/spinal stability. You do not want to accomplish an increase of movement speed at the expense of spinal stabilization. Bring up your leg only as high as you can without flattening your back or bending your knee. Increasing hamstring flexibility will come with time.\nEXERCISE 5\nSide Plank\nThe side plank works the muscles on the lateral (side) parts of the core, such as the obliques, gluteus medius, and quadratus lumborum. This exercise is a very important one. I mention this because almost everyone hates doing it. But don\u2019t give up: Your back depends on it. Many readers will not be able to do this exercise at first because their core is weak. Don\u2019t worry. There are regressions (easier exercises) for those of you who can\u2019t do this one yet.\nStep 1: Start by lying on your side, propped up on your forearm, with your elbow under your shoulder. Relax the other arm for now. Pull your lower arm shoulder blade inward toward your spine and downward toward your buttocks, engaging the lat muscles.\nStep 2: Drop your hips back a bit so that they sit behind your feet and shoulders."}]}

I will split to a few parts.\n\nPROLOGUE\nFilon stood at the front of the lecture hall, his eyes scanning the sea of faces in front of him. He was a lecturer at the University of Lisbon, with a doctorate in philosophy and a passion for imparting knowledge to his students. Today's lecture was on errors in reasoning, and Filon was confident in his ability to engage and educate his audience.\n\"Good morning, everyone,\" Filon began, his voice calm and steady. \"Today, we will be discussing common pitfalls in logical thinking and how to avoid them. Are there any questions before we begin?\"\nFilon fielded a few questions from his students before launching into his lecture, his voice carrying clearly through the room as he outlined the various types of logical fallacies and their consequences. The students listened attentively, taking notes and asking questions as Filon went through the material.\nAfter the lecture, Filon headed to the depot to begin his shift as a tram driver. He loved driving trams, and the steady routine of his job brought him a sense of peace and purpose. Filon spent the next few hours driving the tram through the city, chatting with his passengers and enjoying the sights and sounds of Lisbon.\nAs the end of his shift approached, Filon was looking forward to going home and relaxing for the evening. He had just a few stops left to make before he reached the end of the route. But as he was rounding a corner, disaster struck. A truck lost control and crashed into the side of the tram, causing it to derail and tumble off the tracks. Filon felt a sharp pain in his chest as he was thrown from his seat, and then everything went black.\nWhen Filon awoke, he found himself in a strange, otherworldly place. He was surrounded by a hazy fog, and a sense of unease settled over him as he tried to make sense of his surroundings.\nAs Filon began to regain consciousness, he became aware of a presence nearby. He opened his eyes and saw a woman standing in front of him, watching him with a grave expression on her face. She seemed almost otherworldly, and Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of awe in her presence. \"Who are you?\" Filon asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\"Greetings,\" said the woman, bowing slightly. \"I am Hu Tao, the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.\"\n\"Where am I?\" Filon asked as Hu Tao approached, a sense of unease growing within him. Hu Tao had a fair complexion and a petite build, with bright scarlet eyes and long dark brown hair fading to crimson at the tips. She wore traditional red clothing with a mandarin collar and black porkpie hat adorned with a plum blossom branch. At first glance, Hu Tao appeared to be a quirky and cheerful girl, but Filon had a feeling that she was more complex than she let on.\n\"This is the border,\" Hu Tao replied gravely. \"It is where the souls of the dead come after they leave their bodies behind. It is the place where you will stay for all eternity.\"\nFilon's mind reeled as he tried to make sense of what Hu Tao was saying. Could it be that he was dead? The idea was hard to accept, but the evidence seemed to be mounting against him.\n\"What happens now?\" Filon asked, struggling to keep his voice steady.\n\"That is up to you,\" Hu Tao replied. \"Some choose to accept their fate and move on to the next life, while others choose to linger in this place, unable or unwilling to let go.\"\nFilon thought about this for a moment, and then reached into his pocket and pulled out a note he had found there. It was written in a strange, otherworldly script that he couldn't decipher, but the words \"chosen one\" and \"superpowers\" jumped out at him.\nCould it be that this was why he had been brought to this place? Filon couldn't be sure.\nFilon decided that he wanted to find out more about these powers and what they might be able to do for him. He resolved to reclaim his body and return to the living world, no matter what obstacles might stand in his way.\nBut first, he needed to find a way out of this strange, misty realm. He turned to Hu Tao, hoping that she might be able to help.\n\"Can you tell me how to leave this place?\" Filon asked, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice.\nHu Tao shook her head, a grave expression on her face. \"I'm afraid that is not possible. The dead are meant to stay here for all eternity. It is the natural order of things.\"\nFilon knew that Hu Tao would not be happy about his desire to leave the border, and he sensed that she would do everything in her power to stop him. He resolved to keep his plans a secret for the time being, at least until he had a better understanding of his powers and how they might be able to help him.\n\"I see,\" Filon said calmly, hiding his disappointment. \"Well, I suppose I will have to make the most of my time here then. Do you have any suggestions for how I might pass the time?\"\nHu Tao seemed to sense that Filon was hiding something, and her eyes narrowed slightly as she studied him. But she didn't press the issue, and instead offered a few suggestions for how Filon could occupy himself in the border.\n\"You could try exploring the realm,\" Hu Tao said. \"There are many interesting sights to see and mysteries to uncover. Or you could try communicating with the other souls here, and see what they have to say.\"\nFilon nodded, pretending to be interested in Hu Tao's suggestions even though his mind was already made up. He knew that he had to find a way out of this place, no matter what it took. And he was determined to use his powers to make it happen.\n \nCHAPTER ONE\nThe Chosen One\u2019s Escape\nFilon had spent countless hours in contemplation, trying to find a way to escape the border and reclaim his physical form. He knew that Hu Tao, the 77th Director of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, would do everything in her power to keep him trapped within the border forever. But Filon was determined to break free, and he knew that with his vast knowledge of science and technology, as well as his newly acquired supernatural abilities, he would find a way out.\n\nAs he delved deep into his thoughts, an idea began to form in his mind. He knew that the key to his escape lay in harnessing the power of electricity, the life force that flowed through all living beings. And so he set to work, using his powers to gather all the necessary materials and tools. He toiled day and night, his hands a blur of motion as he assembled generators, transformers, and miles of high voltage wires.\n\nFinally, after weeks of intense labor, Filon's creation was complete. He stood in front of the massive machine, his hands trembling with excitement as he prepared to flip the switch. And with a deafening roar, the machine came to life, its powerful energy coursing through Filon's body and imbuing him with the strength and vitality he needed to break free from the border.\n\nWith a fierce determination, Filon set off, his powerful aura melting away the barriers and puzzles that Hu Tao had put in place to keep the dead trapped within the border. He moved with lightning speed, his senses heightened and his reflexes sharpened by the energy coursing through his veins.\n\nAs he approached the exit, Filon knew that Hu Tao would be waiting for him. He braced himself for the inevitable confrontation, his mind racing as he prepared for the fight to come. And then, as he stepped through the threshold and into the mortal world, he saw her standing there, her grave expression and flowing white robes a stark contrast to the vibrant energy pulsing within him.\n\n\"You should not have come here, Filon,\" Hu Tao said, her voice cold and menacing. \"The dead are meant to stay within the border, and you are no exception.\"\n\n\"I will not be trapped here any longer,\" Filon replied, his voice laced with determination. \"I have reclaimed my physical form and I will not be held captive by the likes of you.\"\n\nAs Filon and Hu Tao continued to argue, Hu Tao became increasingly agitated. Despite Filon's calm and measured approach, Hu Tao was unwilling to listen to his reasons for wanting to leave the border.\n\n\"You think you can just waltz out of here and live your life like nothing ever happened?\" Hu Tao snarled. \"You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. The living world is a dangerous place, full of suffering and pain. You're better off staying here where you're safe.\"\n\nFilon shook his head. \"I can't just sit here and do nothing. I have a purpose, a goal. I have the knowledge and skills to make a difference in this world. I can't let that go to waste just because I'm dead.\"\nHu Tao sneered. \"Your skills and knowledge mean nothing here. You're nothing but a dead man, and that's all you'll ever be.\"\n\nFilon's patience was wearing thin. He could see that Hu Tao was not going to listen to reason, and he knew that he had to take matters into his own hands.\n\n\"You are no match for me, Filon,\" Hu Tao sneered, her eyes flashing with anger. \"I am the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and I have the power to erase your very existence.\"\n\nFilon knew that Hu Tao was not bluffing. She had the power to erase his memories and send him back to the border, trapping him once again in the realm of the dead. But he was not about to let that happen. With a fierce determination, he summoned all his strength and prepared to do battle.\n\n\"If that's how you feel, then I have no choice but to defend myself,\" Filon said, his voice calm but firm.\n\nHu Tao laughed. \"You think you can take me on? I am the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and I have powers beyond your understanding. You stand no chance against me.\"\n\nFilon was undaunted. He knew that he had the power and the skills to defeat Hu Tao, and he was determined to use them to protect himself and his goals.\n\nThe two clashed, their powerful auras colliding in a violent explosion of energy. Filon fought with all his might, using his knowledge of science and technology to unleash a barrage of electrical attacks that caught Hu Tao off guard. She fought back with all her strength, her Pyro abilities proving to be a formidable match for Filon's own.\n\nBut Filon was not to be underestimated. He fought with a fierce determination, his calm and collected demeanor belaying the sheer power he possessed. He used his abilities to control the very electricity that flowed through his veins, creating powerful blasts of energy that sent Hu Tao flying.\n\nIn the end, it was Filon who emerged victorious. Hu Tao lay on the ground, her body broken and battered, as Filon stood at the exit of the border, ready to make his escape and start a new life, he was stopped by the sight of Hu Tao blocking his path. She stood with a grave expression, flowing white robes billowing around her in the wind.\n\n\"You cannot leave,\" Hu Tao said, her voice cold and firm. \"You are not supposed to be here. It is against the natural order of things.\"\n\nFilon tried to reason with her, explaining that he had no intention of causing any harm or disruption to the balance of the world. He just wanted to live a normal life and make a positive contribution to society.\n\nBut Hu Tao was unmoved by his words. \"You do not understand,\" she said. \"Your very existence here is a threat. I cannot allow you to leave and reveal the secrets of this place to the living.\"\nShe raised her hand and a bright light began to glow around her palm. Filon knew immediately what she intended to do \u2013 erase his memory and send him back to the border, a mindless ghost doomed to wander the realms of the dead forever.\n\nFilon's aura, however, was strong and his powers too great to be overcome by Hu Tao's attempt at mind control. The light flickered and died, and Hu Tao's expression turned to one of shock and anger.\n\n\"You will not get away with this,\" she snarled, drawing her sword. \"I will not let you leave and ruin everything I have worked for.\"\n\nFilon knew he had no choice but to fight. He summoned his powers, his hair growing longer and his eyes glowing with energy as he prepared to defend himself. Hu Tao attacked fiercely, her sword flashing through the air as she tried to strike Filon down.\n\nBut Filon was more than a match for her. He moved with lightning speed, dodging and weaving around her attacks as he countered with powerful blasts of electricity. He used his technical knowledge to build and summon various gadgets and machines to aid in the fight, all the while keeping his calm and focusing on the task at hand.\n\nHu Tao was no amateur fighter, but Filon's superior skills and powers proved to be too much for her. She stumbled and fell, her sword clattering to the ground as Filon stood over her, panting and triumphant.\n\n\"It is over,\" Filon said, his voice filled with sadness and regret. \"I did not want it to come to this, but you left me no choice.\"\n\nHu Tao lay on the ground, defeated. Filon knew that he had no choice but to kill her, as she would never stop trying to stop him. He hesitated for a moment, not wanting to take a life, but in the end he knew it was necessary for his own survival. He raised his hand and sent a final burst of electricity coursing through Hu Tao's body, ending her life.\n\nThe Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, without a person to take over as director, collapses, and news of the mysterious newcomer slowly spreads around the world. Filon, feeling both guilty and relieved, sets off on a journey to make a new life for himself and find a way to make amends for the life he had taken.\n\nFilon decides to go to Mondstadt, as he has heard that it is a nation full of freedom and opportunity. He believes that he will be able to use his technical knowledge and superpowers to make a positive impact in the nation, and he is excited to explore all that Mondstadt has to offer. Additionally, the city's beauty and atmosphere appeal to Filon, and he feels drawn to its culture and values. Overall, Filon believes that Mondstadt is the perfect place for him to start his new life and make a difference in the world of Teyvat."}]}

It wakes up the gluteal muscles (the big muscles in your buttocks). It reinforces spinal stabilization. It builds endurance and strength in the muscles on the front and back of the core. And it is the precursor to doing a proper squat, which comes later in the book. \nDo the bridge as follows:\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Bend your knees and put your feet in a flexed position so that your heels are on the ground and the balls of your feet and toes are off of the ground as pictured.\nStep 4: Squeeze your buttocks together as if you were trying to pinch a coin between them.\n\nStep 5: Here\u2019s the tricky part: Using the glutes, lift your hips/torso off of the ground without moving your lower back. You should not articulate the spine and roll up \u201cone vertebra at a time.\u201d You want to do the opposite of that. You want to lift the torso in one solid piece while maintaining your neutral spine. No movement should take place in the lower back.\nStep 6: Hold for five to ten seconds (remember these are suggestions. Hold to your tolerance in the beginning, with ten seconds being your goal). You should feel the muscles in both sides of your buttocks working relatively equally.\nStep 7: Lower your back down to the starting position without losing your neutral spine. Again, do not articulate the spine on the way down. In other words, do not roll the spine down onto the floor one vertebra at a time.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 2 through 7, and do five to ten reps, with ten being your long-term goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Hamstring cramping. If your hamstrings cramp (the muscles that run down the underside of your thighs), gently push your feet into the floor away from you before you lift your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Knee pain. If one or both of your knees hurt, lightly press your knees outward before lifting your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Unable to maintain neutral spine. Start by trying to lift your hips/torso only an inch off the ground. Slowly progress to a full bridge over the next few weeks.\n\u2022 Unable to feel glutes working. Go to Chapter 13. Then come back and start with the following regression.\n\u2022 If your back hurts with this exercise, proceed to the Buttock Squeezes regression on the next page. Try these for a few days or weeks and then come back and try the bridge again, making sure to follow instructions meticulously. If your back still hurts, you may have a spinal condition like severe stenosis that makes you sensitive to extension in the spine. If this is the case, this exercise might not be for you.\nCommon Mistakes\nThe most common mistake for back patients with the bridge exercise is that they use their hamstrings instead of their glutes to bring the hips up into position. If your hamstrings are cramping, then you aren\u2019t using your glutes enough. Go to Chapter 13 and practice \u201cwaking up your glutes,\u201d and then come back to this exercise and try it again.\nREGRESSION\nButtock Squeezes\nIf you don\u2019t have the strength or control yet to perform a single bridge exercise properly for any amount of time, start with buttock squeezes.\n1. Lie on your back, with arms at your side, knees bent, feet hip-width apart.\n2. Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your buttocks together as if trying to squeeze a coin between them.\n4. Hold for ten seconds.\n5. Do ten reps.\nPROGRESSION\nOne-Leg Bridge\nOnce you have mastered the bridge and are able to do it with relative ease and with no discomfort in the back, you may want to progress to the one-leg bridge. You do not have to progress to this exercise. Depending on your spinal condition and your fitness level, you may not need to progress this far. This progression is for those who are reasonably fit and plan to be very active in sports, exercise, or outdoor activities.\n1. Follow all rules for the bridge.\n2. Once your hips and torso are off the ground, give extra care to make sure your core is braced as firmly as possible.\n\n3. Slowly extend one leg at the knee without letting the hips/torso drop on that side. You will feel the glutes of the other stabilizing leg kick in as you extend the leg.\n4. Hold five to ten seconds.\n5. Slowly bring the extended leg back to the bent-knee starting position. (Do not lower your hips/torso while doing this. Maintain the bridge position with a neutral spine until your foot is back on the floor.)\n6. Slowly lower your hips/torso back to the starting position on the floor without articulating the spine.\n7. On the other side, repeat Steps 1 through 6, making sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your core in place before extending the leg at the knee.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 When you go to one leg, it is easy to \u201ccock\u201d your hips to one side, to make it easier. Don\u2019t do that. Keep your thighs parallel during the whole exercise. If you can\u2019t, you aren\u2019t strong enough yet for this exercise.\n\u2022 Regarding extending the leg as you come up/bending the leg down as you go down: Make sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your spine before you try to extend the leg. Conversely, make sure you bring the leg all the way back in before coming down to the starting position.\n\u2022 Do not bring the thigh of the extended leg up. Make sure your thighs remain parallel so that you have to use the gluteal muscles to keep the pelvis stable.\nEXERCISE 3\nCrunch and Plank\nWe discuss these two exercises together because they both do a lot of the same things, and some of you will not get to the plank and that\u2019s okay. The plank will take you a bit further toward returning to strenuous activities, but the crunch is enough to get you out of pain. The purpose of the crunch and the plank is to build endurance and strength in the abdominal wall (crunch and plank) and glutes and lats (plank) and to increase spinal stability. Very few back pain sufferers are strong enough to do a plank properly in the beginning and must do crunches for a while before attempting the plank.\nCrunch\nFirst of all, this exercise is not a sit-up. Sit-ups (the traditional \u201cArmy sit-up,\u201d where you pull yourself into a full sitting position) have been proven to be very risky to the spine. They run dangerous loads through the lumbar discs. If you wanted to develop a way to herniate a disc in a lab, a sit-up would be a good candidate for it. Crunches, unlike full sit-ups, do not allow movement in the lumbar spine. Your lumbar spine stays in neutral throughout.\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Place your hands behind your head, if possible. If you can\u2019t, because of shoulder discomfort, that\u2019s okay. Find a comfortable position for your hands.\nStep 4: Gently draw your chin in toward your neck, giving yourself a \u201cdouble chin.\u201d Hold this position throughout the exercise.\nStep 5: Slowly and carefully raise your shoulder blades and head toward the ceiling an inch or two, giving a moderate squeeze in the abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your lower back. Keep a neutral spine; this will be harder than you think. Only bring your shoulders off the floor as far as you can without moving your lower back. The max distance, when you\u2019re great at it, would be no more than, say, four inches.\n\nStep 6: Hold five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nStep 7: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your lower back.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 1 through 7, for five to ten reps, with ten being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u201cMy neck hurts.\u201d First, you shouldn\u2019t be pulling your head with your arms. Your arms/hands are there only to provide a little support to your head and neck. Make sure that you pull your chin in toward your neck before initiating the exercise. This will engage your deep neck flexors that support the spine. If this does not relieve neck pain, move to the Regression.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 The most common mistake is flattening or (worse) rounding the back. It is crucial that you not make this mistake. Doing crunches while continually rounding or flattening the back will promote spinal instability, the opposite of our goal. Details matter!\n\u2022 Chin jutting. If your chin is poking out toward the ceiling with each rep, you are not stabilizing your cervical spine and your neck extensors are taking over. Make sure to draw the chin in toward your neck before each rep.\nREGRESSION\nAbdominal Contractions\nDo this exercise until you build up enough abdominal strength to accomplish the crunch.\n1. Start in the same position as for the bridge.\n2. Place one hand behind your lower back and one hand inside your front hipbone beside your navel.\n3. Squeeze your abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your back. You should feel your back being still with one hand and the abs engaging with the other hand.\n4. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n5. Repeat for several reps until fatigue sets in.\nPROGRESSION\nPlank\nOnce you have mastered the crunch and are able to do crunches with relative ease and without pain or movement in the lower back, try the plank. This is a great exercise to build increased core stability, endurance, and strength. Some of you (especially those with severe stenosis) may never be able to do a plank. That\u2019s okay. Give the plank a try, and if it doesn\u2019t work for you, stay with crunches. If you do go on to the plank, follow the directions closely; most people do this exercise incorrectly.\n\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent and palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders.\n5. Lift your knees off of the floor so you are now on your toes and forearms.\n6. \u201cTraction\u201d your forearms into the floor. In other words, press them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and down toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n\n7. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n8. Slowly put your knees back down first. Do not let your hips/pelvis go to the floor first; this would put your back into extension and may cause pain.\n9. Repeat Steps 1 through 8, for two to five reps, with five being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my lower back.\u201d Some people just can\u2019t do a plank. Even if they do it the right way, it still aggravates their back. If you can\u2019t do a plank, drop it and stick with crunches. But first, be sure that you can\u2019t do it. For example, if your lower back is hurting, try sticking your buttocks in the air a little more. It could be that your hips are sagging toward the floor, putting your back into extension. Also, make sure the core is fully engaged before moving from knees to toes. Lastly, make sure you are squeezing your buttocks, which will support the lower back. If none of that works, forget it; stick with crunches.\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my shoulders.\u201d Make sure you are tractioning your forearms down into the floor and back toward your toes. This engages the supportive muscles of the rotator cuff. If this doesn\u2019t help, try the regression that follows.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 Feet and legs are not together, which makes gluteal engagement more difficult.\n\u2022 Back is up but the hips are dropping toward the floor. This will cause back pain in people with conditions such as stenosis or facet syndrome.\n\u2022 You\u2019re forgetting to pull shoulders back and forearms into the floor with chin jutting. This will cause an increase in pressure in the shoulders and/or neck, resulting in shoulder and neck pain.\nREGRESSION\nPlank on Knees\nIf you aren\u2019t quite ready for plank but think crunch is just too easy, try this one.\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent, palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders (see illustration, for the plank).\n5. Traction your forearms into the floor, pulling them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and back toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n6. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nEXERCISE 4\nDynamic Hamstring Stretch\nCAUTION\nThis exercise may irritate symptoms of people with active radiculopathy, such as severe leg/foot pain, and numbness or tingling in the legs or feet. If you have these symptoms, start with caution; you may not be able to do this exercise. If this exercise exacerbates your leg or back symptoms, skip it for now and come back to it when the symptoms are resolved.\nThe dynamic hamstring stretch helps to improve mobility in the hips and also helps to reinforce and strengthen your ability to maintain a neutral spine while moving the legs. It also builds endurance and strength in the core.\nStep 1: Lie on your back and find neutral spine.\nStep 2: Brace the core to lock in neutral spine.\n\nStep 3: Bend one leg at the knee with your foot flat on floor. Straighten out the other leg onto the floor, with foot flexed (toes pointed up).\nStep 4: Carefully raise the straight leg without losing your neutral spine; in other words, make sure your lower back isn\u2019t flattening into the floor as your leg comes up. To check, put one of your hands underneath your lower back and feel for movement. Raise the leg only as high as you can without flattening your back into the floor. \nStep 5: Do ten to twenty repetitions on each leg. Do as many as needed to feel that you have mildly stretched your hamstrings and worked your core.\nCommon Mistake\nFlattening the back into the floor as you bring the leg up. Remember, one of the most important points of these exercises is to teach you neutral spine/spinal stability. You do not want to accomplish an increase of movement speed at the expense of spinal stabilization. Bring up your leg only as high as you can without flattening your back or bending your knee. Increasing hamstring flexibility will come with time.\nEXERCISE 5\nSide Plank\nThe side plank works the muscles on the lateral (side) parts of the core, such as the obliques, gluteus medius, and quadratus lumborum. This exercise is a very important one. I mention this because almost everyone hates doing it. But don\u2019t give up: Your back depends on it. Many readers will not be able to do this exercise at first because their core is weak. Don\u2019t worry. There are regressions (easier exercises) for those of you who can\u2019t do this one yet.\nStep 1: Start by lying on your side, propped up on your forearm, with your elbow under your shoulder. Relax the other arm for now. Pull your lower arm shoulder blade inward toward your spine and downward toward your buttocks, engaging the lat muscles.\nStep 2: Drop your hips back a bit so that they sit behind your feet and shoulders."}]}
{"timestamp": 8191, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3397, "Output Length": 48, "prompt": "read this Sitcome\n\nDefining the Genre\nSo, what is a situational comedy? As the sitcom clich\u00e9 goes, Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u2018sitcom\u2019 as:\n\u2018a radio or television comedy series that involves a continuing cast of characters in a succession of episodes\u2019\u00a0\nSo a sitcom is simply a comedy in a situation. Frequently, this incorporates an ensemble cast of characters, who rarely change and rarely develop. The Simpsons is a sitcom which best exemplifies this lack of change as even after 30 years, the central characters are still the same age, in the same house, in the same town and even in the same clothes.\nThe situation is the place to start when writing a sitcom. The location and the cast of characters is vital to fuelling the comedy.\nSo, the \u2018precinct\u2019 or primary setting. This will be the starting point for the controlling idea of the show. When it comes to precincts there are three typical types of locations in which a sitcom can be situated.\n\\* The workplace\n\\* A home\n\\* A combination of the two\n\u00a0\n1. Workplace\nBrooklyn Nine Nine uses a literal precinct in the form of the 99th Police Precinct. This is classed as a workplace situation comedy and features police officers in their various roles.\nOther examples of workplace sitcoms include the TV studio in 30 Rock, the bars in It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Cheers, the basement filled with nerds in The IT Crowd, the various political buildings and offices in Veep and The Thick of it and\u00a0the offices in The Office and\u00a0Parks and Recreation.\nThe concept of the workplace could also be less literal and include schools, universities and colleges, as in Bad Education and\u00a0Community.\u00a0The casts are therefore work colleagues or a work \u2018family\u2019.\nTo create an example, a sitcom could be set in a pizzeria, which is a place of work that would allow for a central cast of pizza chefs, owners, and waiters. But it could also feature recurring characters such as customers and delivery drivers.\n\nBest Cold Opens | Parks and Recreation\n\n[![Best Cold Opens | Parks and Recreation](https://industrialscripts.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Feey-wOyTOJs%2F0.jpg)  \nWatch this video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/eey-wOyTOJs)\n2. Home\nThe home precinct is demonstrated in the aforementioned eternal sitcom The Simpsons, and in a number of other shows based around where people live.\nThese types of sitcoms include Friends, New Girl, Seinfeld,\u00a0Modern Family,\u00a0What We Do In The Shadows and Spaced.\nThe primary location of each of these shows is a place where people live. Therefore, the casts consist of biological families or makeshift families formed of roommates or friends.\n\n3. Multiple Precincts\nThe precinct is not always the only location and almost all shows include a number of bases for the characters to interact in, both in private and public.\n\\* Frasier includes the radio station and Frasier\u2019s apartment as the two main bases but also frequently features a coffee shop.\n\\* Friends also centres around two neighbouring apartments and a coffee shop.\n\\* The school is the meeting place of the main characters in The Inbetweeners,\u00a0but the show itself rarely centres within the school. Each episode focuses more on the characters being put into a new situation such as a theme park trip, night out or work experience.\nIt is rare that a sitcom only centres on one place. But it is vital for your own sitcom writing experience that the characters have a location where they can all meet. There, they can link up to go on a variety of antics.\nHowever, a precinct doesn\u2019t make it a sitcom. So far, all we have is a part of the situation. Unless you have comedic characters you\u2019ve just written something more akin to a soap opera.\n\u00a0\nFunny People\nA sitcom will not succeed unless it has characters who are funny. Funny can\u2019t be the characters primary defintion though. The comedy has to come from somewhere intrinsically tied to who that character is.\nWhen writing comedic characters, Judd Apatow often starts by reading self-help books, which allow him to think psychologically about his characters and build them from flaws and insecurities. This is a good example of how even comedic characters need depth.\n\u00a0\nComedic Conflict\nA basis of contradictory personalities and conflict is integral to every sitcom and to comedy in general. It is the first thing you should be considering when creating your characters in your sitcom.\nTo continue the earlier pizzeria example, it is important to create a makeshift family that all contradict each other. This may mean ensuring that one pizza chef is an Italian pizza purist, while another is an advocate of hot dog stuffed crusts, for example.\n\n\u00a0\nDifferent Forms of Sitcoms\nAnother important consideration to take into account when writing a sitcom is what form it will take. This will determine how the script will be written. Forms of sitcom include:\nSingle-Camera\n\\* These are the simplest to write and follow dramatic writing conventions, as seen in Atlanta, New Girl, Gavin and Stacey.\n\\* Many shows use the single-camera form as an opportunity to create filmic episodes, giving the writer more scope to incorporate homages to other films and genres as seen in Community and Spaced.\n\\* The misleadingly named single-camera form usually uses more than one camera, but is shot without an audience.\nMulti-Camera\n\\* These are often studio shows, shot in front of a live audience.\n\\* A consideration when writing is to leave spaces between jokes to allow for audience laughter.\n\\* Examples include: Friends, Frasier, The Big Bang Theory, The IT Crowd.\nAnimated\n\\* Similarly to single-camera, the animated sitcom allows for more creativity. For example, the use of surrealist jokes. After all, anything that can be created can be drawn.\n\\* Examples include: The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, Family Guy, BoJack Horseman.\nComedic Genres\nThere are many different comedic genres within comedy. Sitcoms often use a combination of styles and genres within them.\nWatching and studying shows like those listed below will give you a good understanding of the potential breadth of genre within the crafting of a sitcom:\n\\* Mockumentary \u2013 eg. The Office,\u00a0Parks and Recreation, Modern Family, What We Do In The Shadows\n\\* Wit and Wordplay \u2013 eg. Frasier, Seinfeld,\u00a0How I Met Your Mother\n\\* Slapstick and Farce \u2013 eg. Fawlty Towers, Friday Night Dinner,\u00a0Arrested Development\n\\* Deadpan \u2013 eg. Flight of The Conchords\n\\* Spoof and Homage \u2013 eg.\u00a0Community, The Simpsons, Spaced\n\\* Satire \u2013 eg. The Thick of It, Veep, W1A, Avenue 5\n\\* Surreal \u2013 eg. BoJack Horseman,\u00a0Family Guy, The Mighty Boosh\n\\* Dark Comedy \u2013 eg. Black Books, It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\n\\* Blue Comedy \u2013 eg. The Inbetweeners,\u00a0Catastrophe\n\\* Cringe \u2013 eg. The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm\nIt\u2019s important always to link the genre of your sitcom to your core values and intensions. These different comedic genres can have different functions. When misapplied or inappropriate their strength can feel undermined.\n\\* For example, The Office is about the minutiae of office life and the ego of the central character desperately trying to impress the omnipresent documentary crew. So a mockumentary format is perfect for this idea.\n\\* Whilst Spaced is about\u00a0a group of aimless young adults saturated in popular culture. So to have it spoof and homage other films and genres makes perfect sense.\n\u00a0\nThe Sitcom Story Structure\nSitcom story structure can be viewed similarly to the scriptwriting of any television show or film,\u00a0 just condensed to a 22-30 minute script. When writing a sitcom the three-act structure can be applied as with every other genre of film or TV. This isn\u2019t a strict rule but a helpful guide to follow.\nFriends Season 1 Episode 5: The One with the East German Laundry Detergent demonstrates sitcom story structure well as it has three separate plots that all rapidly go through the three-act structure. It demonstrates how sitcoms both use the traditional film three-act structure but also have unique elements to their form as well.\n\u00a0\nFirst Act:\nThe friends are all gathered in the coffee shop. During the first act, they split up into pairs, creating three separate plots with two main characters in each.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel agree to meet and do laundry. Ross is nervous when he convinces himself that it is a date and wants it to go well. Rachel wants to do her own laundry to feel independent.\nB Plot: Chandler wants to break up with his girlfriend, Janice. Phoebe wants to break up with her boyfriend, Tony.\nC Plot: Joey wants to take his ex-girlfriend, Angela, on a date. So, he convinces Angela to go on a double date. Angela and her new boyfriend will go on a double date with Joey and Monica. However, Joey tells Monica that Bob is actually Angela\u2019s brother, so Monica thinks she\u2019s being set up with Bob.\nSecond Act:\nAll three subplots go through mild, comedic obstacles to achieve their goals, which were established in the first act.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel go to the laundrette. Ross defends Rachel\u2019s washing machine from being taken by a \u2018horrible woman\u2019. Ross proceeds to teach her to do laundry. Rachel\u2019s laundry doesn\u2019t go well and everything turns pink.\nB Plot: Phoebe easily breaks up with her boyfriend while Chandler is unable to break up with Janice. Chandler breaks the news to Janice and she reacts negatively.\nC Plot: Joey continues to conceal the motives behind the double date. He plants the seeds for Bob to break up with Angela by highlighting Angela\u2019s unappealing traits while he acts as a wingman for Monica. Monica and Angela go to the bathroom together and discuss Bob.\n\nThird Act:\nA Plot: Rachel stands up to the horrible woman proving her independence and Ross and Rachel briefly kiss. Ross then bumps his head on a washing machine door. During the End Tag, Rachel is icing Ross\u2019 head.\nB Plot: Phoebe intervenes in Chandler\u2019s break up and Janice leaves happily. During the End Tag, Chandler runs through the streets celebrating his newfound freedom.\nC Plot: Joey confesses to Monica that Bob and Angela aren\u2019t siblings and the two agree to break the couple up. During the End Tag, Joey and Monica return from their date, overjoyed at having \u201cripped that couple apart\u201d.\nEveryone is basically in the same position as they were in when the episode started. They have gone through minor changes but are ultimately all still sat in the coffee shop together. The story has gone in a circle.\n\u00a0\nOther Examples and Structures\nDan Harmon, creator of Community\u00a0and\u00a0Rick and Morty handily adapted the 3-act structure into a story circle. The situation is allowed to change over the course of the episode but ultimately the characters are unchanged and in relatively the same position.\nHarmon\u2019s story circle is partially based on the \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d and blueprints a successful structure for a sitcom.\n\n1. A character is in their comfort zone or regular situation (the precinct),\n2. But they want or need something else,\n3. They go into an unfamiliar situation or cross a threshold,\n4. The character adapts to the situation while facing trials and obstacles,\n5. Finding what they wanted, whether they like it or not,\n6. But the new situation \u201ckicks their ass\u201d and forces them to pay the price,\n7. Then they return to their familiar situation (the precinct),\n8. The events of the episode have changed them. In sitcom, this is rarely drastic.\nSitcoms are only 22-30 minutes long and thus the story structure is compressed and the story is almost on fast forward.\n\u00a0\nWrite What You Know \u2013 But Make it Funny\nOne of the most common pieces of advice that people seem to tell you when writing is to write what you know. This is also true in sitcom, but as always, it doesn\u2019t mean you can only write about yourself.\nTake funny situations that happen to you and put your characters in the same situation, adapt the story of your life. If you meet someone that makes you laugh \u2013 write a similar character to them in to your medieval sitcom.\n\u00a0\nHow to Actually Write A Sitcom Script\nIn terms of how to write a screenplay, the writing process of a sitcom script is similar to any other script. However, there are a few ways in which a sitcom script may vary. Consider the following elements of a sitcom script:\n\\* The Cold Open \u2013 This is an opportunity to include a joke which doesn\u2019t play into the rest of the episode as a comedic hook to draw in a new audience.\n\\* The End Tag \u2013 Very similar to the cold open but at the end of the episode. Often it is a payoff to a small set-up from earlier in the episode. But it can also be an entirely original joke involving one or two characters (Troy and Abed often serve this purpose in Community).\n\\* Use of Flashbacks/Cutaways \u2013\u00a0Family Guy, 30 Rock and most mockumentaries frequently use flashbacks and cutaways for quick punchlines and gags.\n\\* Callbacks and Running Jokes \u2013\u00a0Arrested Development\u00a0is a particularly excellent series for having jokes that pop up in different iterations throughout the series. It\u2019s a kind of language that show itself will create and repeatedly use throughout.\n\\* Fast Paced Scenes \u2013 Scenes in sitcoms are rarely long, 1-2 pages per scene or set-up is fairly standard as it keeps the pace moving quickly and you can move on to the next joke or comedic setup quickly.\n\u00a0\nRe-Draft to Make It Funnier\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your script, workshop it with people. Read it through aloud and see which bits are funny and which bits need work. Then, re-write, re-read, re-workshop your script.\nThis process will have developed it into something that, at the very least, you and your workshop find funny. If it makes you laugh, chances are it\u2019ll make a few other people laugh.\nPerhaps more than most genres, comedy is hard to get right without finding out if it works with an audience. This is even more relevant in a sitcom. So sharing your work with others and seeing how it plays to a room (however big or small that room may be) is a vital step in the process.\n\u00a0\nAnd Finally\u2026 Don\u2019t forget to Defy Genre\nWhen writing a sitcom, remember to innovate and create a genre hybrid. Combining elements of different genres and forms can create interesting and exciting new ideas.\n\\* What We Do In The Shadows, for example, combines a house-share, a mockumentary and a world in which supernatural creatures exist.\n\\* Peep Show\u00a0takes a flat share and gives the main characters internal monologues.\n\\* Community\u00a0takes a number of different genres and uses them throughout the series to create different innovative episodes within the sitcom genre.\nInnovation makes the sitcom and your script stand out. This guide has given you the outline of what a sitcom is, how it works and how to write one.\nIt\u2019s also important to know that as with everything else, these rules can and sometimes should be broken. If you want to write a sitcom about a pizzeria then do it. If you want to stray further from the norms and set this pizzeria in a medieval kingdom, that is your prerogative.\nInnovation is important and so is enjoying what you\u2019re writing. So write what you know, and write what you like. If your enthusiasm for the idea jumps off the page, then it will be of interest to like-minded people.\nSitcoms are there to make us laugh, comfort us and re-unite us every night with characters we\u2019ve grown to know. It\u2019s vital that in a genre with these intentions, these elements are baked into to the writing."}]}

{"timestamp": 8267, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3166, "Output Length": 86, "prompt": "Part 4 (acknowledge and await part 5 and any other parts):\n\nTrenton (Trenton Journal)\n\nThe second community for which we assessed information needs was Trenton. The survey was distributed by Miles, owner of The Trenton Journal, to people in his network, including the nonprofit community foundation for which he also works, as well as prominent churches. Miles also posted a link to the survey in his newsletter and on his website. As in Paterson, we also created a printed flyer with the survey link and a QR code. Because of the financial incentive, we had a number of false responses by bots or people trying to game the drawing, which we also saw in Paterson. The final N, after cleaning, was 119 (recall that all questions were optional, so the numbers reported below often do not add up to 119).\n\nThe survey respondents were distributed evenly among the four wards of Trenton; this suggests that Trenton Journal\u2019s coverage of the four wards should be roughly equal. \n\nTable 1: Where survey respondents live\nEast Ward \nNorth Ward\nSouth Ward\nWest Ward\n21\n25\n23\n22\nThe graphic below shows how long the respondents have lived in Trenton. There is marked variation here depending on the ward; in the West, South and North wards, more than 65% of residents have lived there for at least six years, while in the south ward more than 55% of residents have been there for at least 11 years, showing depth of connection to the community. The East ward is the most evenly distributed and has the greatest percentage of residents who have been there for less than a year; notably, all of the respondents from the North ward have lived there for at least a year. The focus group respondents also tended to be people who have lived in the city for a decade or longer (we did not differentiate their answers by ward).\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nIn general, the respondents who live in Trenton\u2019s South Ward stood out as having different experiences and opinions in many cases, compared to residents of other wards. Perhaps surprisingly, given how long people have lived in the area, they were much more likely to say their community is a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d place to live (43%). For comparison, only 23% of the East Ward, 19% of the West Ward, and 20% of the North Ward residents said the same (see graphic below). Because of this and other marked differences, the responses of South Ward residents were considered separately for the analysis.\n\nRespondents from the West ward were generally happiest with their community\u2019s quality of life, with more than half stating that Trenton is a good or excellent place to live, followed by respondents from the East and North wards, where roughly half think the same. By contrast, nearly half of respondents from the South ward said Trenton is a poor or terrible place to live, and the fewest calling it a fair place to live, showing the strongest division of opinion on the question. \n\nWe asked people to describe the community in one sentence. Some of the responses were negative:\n\nThere are a lot of empty houses in my neighborhood.\nLack of police presence.\nLots of crime and gangs.\n\nBut others struck a balanced and nuanced view of the strengths and challenges:\nEclectic mix of good and bad.\nTrenton should be so much nicer than it is, but it is well located and there is lots in the surrounding area that is wonderful.\nA good community where good people and good news is lost in the bad press and violence by a few in the community.\nYou can see the beauty within the struggle.\nIt depends where you live in the community.\n\nPeople in both focus groups acknowledged problems with the area \u2013 lack of repairs to facilities and problems accessing public information came up several times \u2013 but also emphasized the many positive sides of Trenton and of the people who live there. They wanted to hear more about these positive stories and have easier access to public information to fix the things that are wrong; these comments informed the recommendations that we made to the publisher (listed below).\n\nWhat are Trenton\u2019s information needs?\n\nAbout 6 in 10 survey respondents said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to keep up with local news. Meanwhile, 40% said it is harder today to keep up with local news compared to three years ago. Only 23% said it was easier. The focus group participants reported following news at the national, state and local levels, usually through mass media such as cable news networks or the evening news. Both survey and focus group participants said they would be excited about a local news source that filled the existing information gaps in Trenton. \n\nSatisfaction/concern\n\nOne survey question asked whether each topic is a significant source of either satisfaction or concern in the community. On many topics, the respondents from Trenton disagreed. The most polarizing issue was crime and safety: 33% feel crime is high and they are unsafe there, while 46% of people think the opposite. \n\nThere were four topics where at least 15% of the people strongly agreed but another at least 15% strongly disagreed:\nCrime is low/high.\nEntertainment options are good/bad.\nJobs are satisfactory/unsatisfactory.\nThe environment is clean/unclean.\n\nAdditionally, local government and politics was the issue most people had an opinion about. Only 10% said this was not important to them. Fifty percent agreed that local officials are effective and trustworthy, while 33% disagreed. The responses to these topic-based questions suggested to us that the Journal will want to be even-handed in its coverage, especially of these divisive local topics.\n\nSome topics, however, evoked agreement:\nThe community\u2019s history. A total of 32% strongly agreed and 60% at least somewhat agreed that Trenton has history and traditions to be proud of.\nSports. A total of 58% agreed that local sports are fun and exciting to follow, while only 21% disagreed.\nSocial issues. A total of 56% agreed that the community shares their values on issues like race, immigration, and abortion.\n\nAnother survey question asked, \u201cHow important is it for you personally to read the following types of information in the Trenton Journal?\u201d\n\nRespondents said the most important topics of coverage were crime, sports, health care, and local government. There were large groups who were \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in other topics: entertainment options, local history and traditions, and local arts and culture. Twenty-six percent said that family life is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them.\nHow people use and access local news\n\nTo better understand The Trenton Journal community\u2019s information needs and the motivations that drive them to seek out local news, we asked them to name the most important reasons they follow local news. The top response was \u201cto stay informed and be a better citizen\u201d (37%). \n\nAfter that nearly a third of respondents said they use local news for entertainment, hobbies, and sports (33%), or to \u201cfind places to go and things to do\u201d (30%). Twenty-eight percent said local news helped them in their job and 26% said it helped them stay safe and avoid crime. These answers point to the importance of \u201cservice journalism,\u201d a simple but extremely practical and helpful practice.\n\nThere were a few most-common ways that survey respondents discover local news in Trenton. Each of these is used every day by 3 in 10 survey respondents, and at least weekly by 50 to 60% of them:\nFrom friends / family.\nGoogle searches.\nReading Facebook News Feed.\nReading Facebook Groups.\n\nFacebook is a major factor in the local news ecosystem of the survey respondents. Nearly 8 in 10 are getting local news and information there regularly. Half use Facebook for news at least once a week. Notably, the everyday news engagement is slightly stronger for Facebook Groups than for Facebook News Feed.\n\nFrequency of use for news\nFacebook News Feed\nFacebook Group\nEvery day\n23%\n28%\nWeekly or more\n55%\n51%\nA few times a month or more\n78%\n67%\nSeparately, we asked people how satisfied they are with various local news sources, including some Facebook Groups. The Facebook Groups ranked higher in satisfaction than any other news source. For example the Group named \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d rated highly, with 25% saying they \u201clove it and use it all the time\u201d and a total of 60% saying they at least \u201cfind it useful and use it sometimes.\u201d Another 18% \u201cdon\u2019t love it, but \u201cuse it when I have to.\u201d Only 10% avoid it and 12% never heard of or used it. The Group named \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton\u201d was more polarizing: 28% \u201clove it\u201d and 16% \u201cdislike\u201d it. Nonetheless, 50% of respondents find it useful sometimes and 65% at least use it when they have to. Focus group participants also reported accessing local news via Facebook, as well as from family/friends and from local television news, in particular on News 12 New Jersey.\n\nOther social networks are used by a smaller number of respondents, suggesting either that the Journal should be cautious about devoting too many scarce resources to other platforms or that the survey and focus groups did not reach community members who use these for local news and information.\n\nSocial network\nPercent using daily\nPercent using 1-2 times a week or more\nInstagram\n19%\n43%\nTwitter\n12%\n37%\nTikTok\n14%\n31%\n\nMeanwhile, about 45% of survey respondents use Trenton Journal social media accounts at least weekly, and 68% visit at least a few times a month. The other newspapers we asked about \u2014 The Trentonian, Trenton Daily, and The Times of Trenton \u2014 ranked lower in satisfaction; these may be secondary sources for some of the Journal\u2019s readers.\nWe also asked survey respondents to name any sources that they \u201ctrust the most for useful, reliable local news and information.\u201d There were a few individual responses to that question that might suggest nontraditional sources with whom the Journal may want to build relationships:\nLuz Esperanza y Vida organization.\nEast Trenton committee.\nTrenton Waves podcast.\nStreet ministries.\nThe Old Mill Hill Society.\n\nWhat people think of Trenton Journal\n\nRespondents generally enjoy Trenton Journal\u2019s content on social media: 21% \u201clove\u201d Trenton Journal social media and use it all the time. Another 41% (the most common answer) say Trenton Journal\u2019s social media is \u201cuseful and use it sometimes.\u201d Only 12% dislike its social accounts, and 12% haven\u2019t heard of them yet. Opinions were stronger among residents of the South Ward. They have a more favorable opinion of Trent Journal\u2019s social media accounts (32% \u201clove it\u201d, another 45% say \u201cuseful sometimes\u201d), and they rated Trenton Journal\u2019s social media accounts as more satisfying than any other local news source. \n\nTrenton Journal\u2019s website and emails were a bit less popular than their social media; still, a majority do find them useful. The website or emails are used by 47% at least weekly and at least 61% visit at least a few times a month. These somewhat contradictory findings should be explored in follow-up conversations with community members or further research.\n\nReader opinion\nTrenton Journal\u2019s \nsocial media accounts\nTrenton Journal\u2019s\n website and emails\n\u201cLove it, use it all the time\u201d\n21%\n19%\n\u201cI find it useful and use it sometimes\u201d\n41%\n39%\n\u201cI dislike it and avoid using it\u201d\n12%\n18%\nNever heard or it or used it\n12%\n9%\n\nWe asked the people familiar with Trenton Journal how well it does certain things. At least 60% of people think it does these things at least \u201cfairly well\u201d:\nIs fair to all sides.\nIs neutral and doesn't take positions on issues.\nActs as a watchdog of powerful institutions and people.\nMakes the news entertaining.\nProvides diverse points of view.\nMakes it easier to find important civic information.\nHelps people understand communities unlike their own.\nVerifies and gets the facts right.\n\nSlightly fewer people, about 55%, think it does these things at least fairly well:\nProvides forums for community discussions,\nReports on possible solutions to problems in society,\n\nAt the same time, a sizeable minority (about 40% of people) thought the Trenton Journal did those things poorly, so there is room to improve. \n\nAs part of the research design, we devised several recommendations for each publisher based on analysis of the data from the survey and focus groups. The recommendations we presented to the Trenton Journal are below, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\n\nRecommendations given to the Trenton Journal\n\nCreate a dedicated section for posting the dates and times of upcoming municipal meetings, similar to your events page; publicize it via your newsletter and social media.\nGo one step further and cover municipal meetings regularly, even if it\u2019s simply by providing a transcript.\nConsider adding a section on your website that lists all city and state departments, the services they provide, and their contact information.\nConsider offering different sub-pages for each ward, that can be tailored to the differing concerns and interest in each.\nEngage to a greater extent on Facebook, and be present on Facebook groups that are relevant in Trenton, especially \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d and \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton.\u201d\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, Trenton Journal decided to make the following changes:\n\nIncrease coverage of municipal meetings, the education system, and crime and safety.\n\nCreate a tab on the website\u2019s resource page to house publicly available data about the city.\n\nCreate an online directory of public officials and other power-holders in the city; increase coverage of them through profiles and interviews.\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them how often they visited Trenton Journal\u2019s website, how they felt about each of these changes, and for any other open-ended feedback they might provide. For each of the changes, we asked whether they agreed or disagreed with this change, and if they disagreed, what they\u2019d like to see done instead. Again the sample was disappointingly small (N=9), but generally positive.\n\nFour of the nine reported visiting the website daily, while three said they visit a few times a week and one said rarely. Perhaps not surprisingly (since the changes were based on community feedback), there was overwhelming agreement with the changes that Trenton Journal is making. However when there was disagreement there was valuable feedback, such as the suggestion to focus on neighborhoods rather than the education system, or to provide data about the percentage of rentals to ownership and information about rental building ownership as part of the publicly available data. One open-ended response stated, \u201cI love the idea of covering municipal government and the people that are associated with it.\u201d"}]}

{"timestamp": 8332, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3166, "Output Length": 86, "prompt": "Part 4 (acknowledge and await part 5 and any other parts):\n\nTrenton (Trenton Journal)\n\nThe second community for which we assessed information needs was Trenton. The survey was distributed by Miles, owner of The Trenton Journal, to people in his network, including the nonprofit community foundation for which he also works, as well as prominent churches. Miles also posted a link to the survey in his newsletter and on his website. As in Paterson, we also created a printed flyer with the survey link and a QR code. Because of the financial incentive, we had a number of false responses by bots or people trying to game the drawing, which we also saw in Paterson. The final N, after cleaning, was 119 (recall that all questions were optional, so the numbers reported below often do not add up to 119).\n\nThe survey respondents were distributed evenly among the four wards of Trenton; this suggests that Trenton Journal\u2019s coverage of the four wards should be roughly equal. \n\nTable 1: Where survey respondents live\nEast Ward \nNorth Ward\nSouth Ward\nWest Ward\n21\n25\n23\n22\nThe graphic below shows how long the respondents have lived in Trenton. There is marked variation here depending on the ward; in the West, South and North wards, more than 65% of residents have lived there for at least six years, while in the south ward more than 55% of residents have been there for at least 11 years, showing depth of connection to the community. The East ward is the most evenly distributed and has the greatest percentage of residents who have been there for less than a year; notably, all of the respondents from the North ward have lived there for at least a year. The focus group respondents also tended to be people who have lived in the city for a decade or longer (we did not differentiate their answers by ward).\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nIn general, the respondents who live in Trenton\u2019s South Ward stood out as having different experiences and opinions in many cases, compared to residents of other wards. Perhaps surprisingly, given how long people have lived in the area, they were much more likely to say their community is a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d place to live (43%). For comparison, only 23% of the East Ward, 19% of the West Ward, and 20% of the North Ward residents said the same (see graphic below). Because of this and other marked differences, the responses of South Ward residents were considered separately for the analysis.\n\nRespondents from the West ward were generally happiest with their community\u2019s quality of life, with more than half stating that Trenton is a good or excellent place to live, followed by respondents from the East and North wards, where roughly half think the same. By contrast, nearly half of respondents from the South ward said Trenton is a poor or terrible place to live, and the fewest calling it a fair place to live, showing the strongest division of opinion on the question. \n\nWe asked people to describe the community in one sentence. Some of the responses were negative:\n\nThere are a lot of empty houses in my neighborhood.\nLack of police presence.\nLots of crime and gangs.\n\nBut others struck a balanced and nuanced view of the strengths and challenges:\nEclectic mix of good and bad.\nTrenton should be so much nicer than it is, but it is well located and there is lots in the surrounding area that is wonderful.\nA good community where good people and good news is lost in the bad press and violence by a few in the community.\nYou can see the beauty within the struggle.\nIt depends where you live in the community.\n\nPeople in both focus groups acknowledged problems with the area \u2013 lack of repairs to facilities and problems accessing public information came up several times \u2013 but also emphasized the many positive sides of Trenton and of the people who live there. They wanted to hear more about these positive stories and have easier access to public information to fix the things that are wrong; these comments informed the recommendations that we made to the publisher (listed below).\n\nWhat are Trenton\u2019s information needs?\n\nAbout 6 in 10 survey respondents said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to keep up with local news. Meanwhile, 40% said it is harder today to keep up with local news compared to three years ago. Only 23% said it was easier. The focus group participants reported following news at the national, state and local levels, usually through mass media such as cable news networks or the evening news. Both survey and focus group participants said they would be excited about a local news source that filled the existing information gaps in Trenton. \n\nSatisfaction/concern\n\nOne survey question asked whether each topic is a significant source of either satisfaction or concern in the community. On many topics, the respondents from Trenton disagreed. The most polarizing issue was crime and safety: 33% feel crime is high and they are unsafe there, while 46% of people think the opposite. \n\nThere were four topics where at least 15% of the people strongly agreed but another at least 15% strongly disagreed:\nCrime is low/high.\nEntertainment options are good/bad.\nJobs are satisfactory/unsatisfactory.\nThe environment is clean/unclean.\n\nAdditionally, local government and politics was the issue most people had an opinion about. Only 10% said this was not important to them. Fifty percent agreed that local officials are effective and trustworthy, while 33% disagreed. The responses to these topic-based questions suggested to us that the Journal will want to be even-handed in its coverage, especially of these divisive local topics.\n\nSome topics, however, evoked agreement:\nThe community\u2019s history. A total of 32% strongly agreed and 60% at least somewhat agreed that Trenton has history and traditions to be proud of.\nSports. A total of 58% agreed that local sports are fun and exciting to follow, while only 21% disagreed.\nSocial issues. A total of 56% agreed that the community shares their values on issues like race, immigration, and abortion.\n\nAnother survey question asked, \u201cHow important is it for you personally to read the following types of information in the Trenton Journal?\u201d\n\nRespondents said the most important topics of coverage were crime, sports, health care, and local government. There were large groups who were \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in other topics: entertainment options, local history and traditions, and local arts and culture. Twenty-six percent said that family life is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them.\nHow people use and access local news\n\nTo better understand The Trenton Journal community\u2019s information needs and the motivations that drive them to seek out local news, we asked them to name the most important reasons they follow local news. The top response was \u201cto stay informed and be a better citizen\u201d (37%). \n\nAfter that nearly a third of respondents said they use local news for entertainment, hobbies, and sports (33%), or to \u201cfind places to go and things to do\u201d (30%). Twenty-eight percent said local news helped them in their job and 26% said it helped them stay safe and avoid crime. These answers point to the importance of \u201cservice journalism,\u201d a simple but extremely practical and helpful practice.\n\nThere were a few most-common ways that survey respondents discover local news in Trenton. Each of these is used every day by 3 in 10 survey respondents, and at least weekly by 50 to 60% of them:\nFrom friends / family.\nGoogle searches.\nReading Facebook News Feed.\nReading Facebook Groups.\n\nFacebook is a major factor in the local news ecosystem of the survey respondents. Nearly 8 in 10 are getting local news and information there regularly. Half use Facebook for news at least once a week. Notably, the everyday news engagement is slightly stronger for Facebook Groups than for Facebook News Feed.\n\nFrequency of use for news\nFacebook News Feed\nFacebook Group\nEvery day\n23%\n28%\nWeekly or more\n55%\n51%\nA few times a month or more\n78%\n67%\nSeparately, we asked people how satisfied they are with various local news sources, including some Facebook Groups. The Facebook Groups ranked higher in satisfaction than any other news source. For example the Group named \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d rated highly, with 25% saying they \u201clove it and use it all the time\u201d and a total of 60% saying they at least \u201cfind it useful and use it sometimes.\u201d Another 18% \u201cdon\u2019t love it, but \u201cuse it when I have to.\u201d Only 10% avoid it and 12% never heard of or used it. The Group named \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton\u201d was more polarizing: 28% \u201clove it\u201d and 16% \u201cdislike\u201d it. Nonetheless, 50% of respondents find it useful sometimes and 65% at least use it when they have to. Focus group participants also reported accessing local news via Facebook, as well as from family/friends and from local television news, in particular on News 12 New Jersey.\n\nOther social networks are used by a smaller number of respondents, suggesting either that the Journal should be cautious about devoting too many scarce resources to other platforms or that the survey and focus groups did not reach community members who use these for local news and information.\n\nSocial network\nPercent using daily\nPercent using 1-2 times a week or more\nInstagram\n19%\n43%\nTwitter\n12%\n37%\nTikTok\n14%\n31%\n\nMeanwhile, about 45% of survey respondents use Trenton Journal social media accounts at least weekly, and 68% visit at least a few times a month. The other newspapers we asked about \u2014 The Trentonian, Trenton Daily, and The Times of Trenton \u2014 ranked lower in satisfaction; these may be secondary sources for some of the Journal\u2019s readers.\nWe also asked survey respondents to name any sources that they \u201ctrust the most for useful, reliable local news and information.\u201d There were a few individual responses to that question that might suggest nontraditional sources with whom the Journal may want to build relationships:\nLuz Esperanza y Vida organization.\nEast Trenton committee.\nTrenton Waves podcast.\nStreet ministries.\nThe Old Mill Hill Society.\n\nWhat people think of Trenton Journal\n\nRespondents generally enjoy Trenton Journal\u2019s content on social media: 21% \u201clove\u201d Trenton Journal social media and use it all the time. Another 41% (the most common answer) say Trenton Journal\u2019s social media is \u201cuseful and use it sometimes.\u201d Only 12% dislike its social accounts, and 12% haven\u2019t heard of them yet. Opinions were stronger among residents of the South Ward. They have a more favorable opinion of Trent Journal\u2019s social media accounts (32% \u201clove it\u201d, another 45% say \u201cuseful sometimes\u201d), and they rated Trenton Journal\u2019s social media accounts as more satisfying than any other local news source. \n\nTrenton Journal\u2019s website and emails were a bit less popular than their social media; still, a majority do find them useful. The website or emails are used by 47% at least weekly and at least 61% visit at least a few times a month. These somewhat contradictory findings should be explored in follow-up conversations with community members or further research.\n\nReader opinion\nTrenton Journal\u2019s \nsocial media accounts\nTrenton Journal\u2019s\n website and emails\n\u201cLove it, use it all the time\u201d\n21%\n19%\n\u201cI find it useful and use it sometimes\u201d\n41%\n39%\n\u201cI dislike it and avoid using it\u201d\n12%\n18%\nNever heard or it or used it\n12%\n9%\n\nWe asked the people familiar with Trenton Journal how well it does certain things. At least 60% of people think it does these things at least \u201cfairly well\u201d:\nIs fair to all sides.\nIs neutral and doesn't take positions on issues.\nActs as a watchdog of powerful institutions and people.\nMakes the news entertaining.\nProvides diverse points of view.\nMakes it easier to find important civic information.\nHelps people understand communities unlike their own.\nVerifies and gets the facts right.\n\nSlightly fewer people, about 55%, think it does these things at least fairly well:\nProvides forums for community discussions,\nReports on possible solutions to problems in society,\n\nAt the same time, a sizeable minority (about 40% of people) thought the Trenton Journal did those things poorly, so there is room to improve. \n\nAs part of the research design, we devised several recommendations for each publisher based on analysis of the data from the survey and focus groups. The recommendations we presented to the Trenton Journal are below, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\n\nRecommendations given to the Trenton Journal\n\nCreate a dedicated section for posting the dates and times of upcoming municipal meetings, similar to your events page; publicize it via your newsletter and social media.\nGo one step further and cover municipal meetings regularly, even if it\u2019s simply by providing a transcript.\nConsider adding a section on your website that lists all city and state departments, the services they provide, and their contact information.\nConsider offering different sub-pages for each ward, that can be tailored to the differing concerns and interest in each.\nEngage to a greater extent on Facebook, and be present on Facebook groups that are relevant in Trenton, especially \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d and \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton.\u201d\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, Trenton Journal decided to make the following changes:\n\nIncrease coverage of municipal meetings, the education system, and crime and safety.\n\nCreate a tab on the website\u2019s resource page to house publicly available data about the city.\n\nCreate an online directory of public officials and other power-holders in the city; increase coverage of them through profiles and interviews.\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them how often they visited Trenton Journal\u2019s website, how they felt about each of these changes, and for any other open-ended feedback they might provide. For each of the changes, we asked whether they agreed or disagreed with this change, and if they disagreed, what they\u2019d like to see done instead. Again the sample was disappointingly small (N=9), but generally positive.\n\nFour of the nine reported visiting the website daily, while three said they visit a few times a week and one said rarely. Perhaps not surprisingly (since the changes were based on community feedback), there was overwhelming agreement with the changes that Trenton Journal is making. However when there was disagreement there was valuable feedback, such as the suggestion to focus on neighborhoods rather than the education system, or to provide data about the percentage of rentals to ownership and information about rental building ownership as part of the publicly available data. One open-ended response stated, \u201cI love the idea of covering municipal government and the people that are associated with it.\u201d"}]}
{"timestamp": 8344, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3397, "Output Length": 48, "prompt": "read this Sitcome\n\nDefining the Genre\nSo, what is a situational comedy? As the sitcom clich\u00e9 goes, Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u2018sitcom\u2019 as:\n\u2018a radio or television comedy series that involves a continuing cast of characters in a succession of episodes\u2019\u00a0\nSo a sitcom is simply a comedy in a situation. Frequently, this incorporates an ensemble cast of characters, who rarely change and rarely develop. The Simpsons is a sitcom which best exemplifies this lack of change as even after 30 years, the central characters are still the same age, in the same house, in the same town and even in the same clothes.\nThe situation is the place to start when writing a sitcom. The location and the cast of characters is vital to fuelling the comedy.\nSo, the \u2018precinct\u2019 or primary setting. This will be the starting point for the controlling idea of the show. When it comes to precincts there are three typical types of locations in which a sitcom can be situated.\n\\* The workplace\n\\* A home\n\\* A combination of the two\n\u00a0\n1. Workplace\nBrooklyn Nine Nine uses a literal precinct in the form of the 99th Police Precinct. This is classed as a workplace situation comedy and features police officers in their various roles.\nOther examples of workplace sitcoms include the TV studio in 30 Rock, the bars in It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Cheers, the basement filled with nerds in The IT Crowd, the various political buildings and offices in Veep and The Thick of it and\u00a0the offices in The Office and\u00a0Parks and Recreation.\nThe concept of the workplace could also be less literal and include schools, universities and colleges, as in Bad Education and\u00a0Community.\u00a0The casts are therefore work colleagues or a work \u2018family\u2019.\nTo create an example, a sitcom could be set in a pizzeria, which is a place of work that would allow for a central cast of pizza chefs, owners, and waiters. But it could also feature recurring characters such as customers and delivery drivers.\n\nBest Cold Opens | Parks and Recreation\n\n[![Best Cold Opens | Parks and Recreation](https://industrialscripts.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Feey-wOyTOJs%2F0.jpg)  \nWatch this video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/eey-wOyTOJs)\n2. Home\nThe home precinct is demonstrated in the aforementioned eternal sitcom The Simpsons, and in a number of other shows based around where people live.\nThese types of sitcoms include Friends, New Girl, Seinfeld,\u00a0Modern Family,\u00a0What We Do In The Shadows and Spaced.\nThe primary location of each of these shows is a place where people live. Therefore, the casts consist of biological families or makeshift families formed of roommates or friends.\n\n3. Multiple Precincts\nThe precinct is not always the only location and almost all shows include a number of bases for the characters to interact in, both in private and public.\n\\* Frasier includes the radio station and Frasier\u2019s apartment as the two main bases but also frequently features a coffee shop.\n\\* Friends also centres around two neighbouring apartments and a coffee shop.\n\\* The school is the meeting place of the main characters in The Inbetweeners,\u00a0but the show itself rarely centres within the school. Each episode focuses more on the characters being put into a new situation such as a theme park trip, night out or work experience.\nIt is rare that a sitcom only centres on one place. But it is vital for your own sitcom writing experience that the characters have a location where they can all meet. There, they can link up to go on a variety of antics.\nHowever, a precinct doesn\u2019t make it a sitcom. So far, all we have is a part of the situation. Unless you have comedic characters you\u2019ve just written something more akin to a soap opera.\n\u00a0\nFunny People\nA sitcom will not succeed unless it has characters who are funny. Funny can\u2019t be the characters primary defintion though. The comedy has to come from somewhere intrinsically tied to who that character is.\nWhen writing comedic characters, Judd Apatow often starts by reading self-help books, which allow him to think psychologically about his characters and build them from flaws and insecurities. This is a good example of how even comedic characters need depth.\n\u00a0\nComedic Conflict\nA basis of contradictory personalities and conflict is integral to every sitcom and to comedy in general. It is the first thing you should be considering when creating your characters in your sitcom.\nTo continue the earlier pizzeria example, it is important to create a makeshift family that all contradict each other. This may mean ensuring that one pizza chef is an Italian pizza purist, while another is an advocate of hot dog stuffed crusts, for example.\n\n\u00a0\nDifferent Forms of Sitcoms\nAnother important consideration to take into account when writing a sitcom is what form it will take. This will determine how the script will be written. Forms of sitcom include:\nSingle-Camera\n\\* These are the simplest to write and follow dramatic writing conventions, as seen in Atlanta, New Girl, Gavin and Stacey.\n\\* Many shows use the single-camera form as an opportunity to create filmic episodes, giving the writer more scope to incorporate homages to other films and genres as seen in Community and Spaced.\n\\* The misleadingly named single-camera form usually uses more than one camera, but is shot without an audience.\nMulti-Camera\n\\* These are often studio shows, shot in front of a live audience.\n\\* A consideration when writing is to leave spaces between jokes to allow for audience laughter.\n\\* Examples include: Friends, Frasier, The Big Bang Theory, The IT Crowd.\nAnimated\n\\* Similarly to single-camera, the animated sitcom allows for more creativity. For example, the use of surrealist jokes. After all, anything that can be created can be drawn.\n\\* Examples include: The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, Family Guy, BoJack Horseman.\nComedic Genres\nThere are many different comedic genres within comedy. Sitcoms often use a combination of styles and genres within them.\nWatching and studying shows like those listed below will give you a good understanding of the potential breadth of genre within the crafting of a sitcom:\n\\* Mockumentary \u2013 eg. The Office,\u00a0Parks and Recreation, Modern Family, What We Do In The Shadows\n\\* Wit and Wordplay \u2013 eg. Frasier, Seinfeld,\u00a0How I Met Your Mother\n\\* Slapstick and Farce \u2013 eg. Fawlty Towers, Friday Night Dinner,\u00a0Arrested Development\n\\* Deadpan \u2013 eg. Flight of The Conchords\n\\* Spoof and Homage \u2013 eg.\u00a0Community, The Simpsons, Spaced\n\\* Satire \u2013 eg. The Thick of It, Veep, W1A, Avenue 5\n\\* Surreal \u2013 eg. BoJack Horseman,\u00a0Family Guy, The Mighty Boosh\n\\* Dark Comedy \u2013 eg. Black Books, It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\n\\* Blue Comedy \u2013 eg. The Inbetweeners,\u00a0Catastrophe\n\\* Cringe \u2013 eg. The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm\nIt\u2019s important always to link the genre of your sitcom to your core values and intensions. These different comedic genres can have different functions. When misapplied or inappropriate their strength can feel undermined.\n\\* For example, The Office is about the minutiae of office life and the ego of the central character desperately trying to impress the omnipresent documentary crew. So a mockumentary format is perfect for this idea.\n\\* Whilst Spaced is about\u00a0a group of aimless young adults saturated in popular culture. So to have it spoof and homage other films and genres makes perfect sense.\n\u00a0\nThe Sitcom Story Structure\nSitcom story structure can be viewed similarly to the scriptwriting of any television show or film,\u00a0 just condensed to a 22-30 minute script. When writing a sitcom the three-act structure can be applied as with every other genre of film or TV. This isn\u2019t a strict rule but a helpful guide to follow.\nFriends Season 1 Episode 5: The One with the East German Laundry Detergent demonstrates sitcom story structure well as it has three separate plots that all rapidly go through the three-act structure. It demonstrates how sitcoms both use the traditional film three-act structure but also have unique elements to their form as well.\n\u00a0\nFirst Act:\nThe friends are all gathered in the coffee shop. During the first act, they split up into pairs, creating three separate plots with two main characters in each.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel agree to meet and do laundry. Ross is nervous when he convinces himself that it is a date and wants it to go well. Rachel wants to do her own laundry to feel independent.\nB Plot: Chandler wants to break up with his girlfriend, Janice. Phoebe wants to break up with her boyfriend, Tony.\nC Plot: Joey wants to take his ex-girlfriend, Angela, on a date. So, he convinces Angela to go on a double date. Angela and her new boyfriend will go on a double date with Joey and Monica. However, Joey tells Monica that Bob is actually Angela\u2019s brother, so Monica thinks she\u2019s being set up with Bob.\nSecond Act:\nAll three subplots go through mild, comedic obstacles to achieve their goals, which were established in the first act.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel go to the laundrette. Ross defends Rachel\u2019s washing machine from being taken by a \u2018horrible woman\u2019. Ross proceeds to teach her to do laundry. Rachel\u2019s laundry doesn\u2019t go well and everything turns pink.\nB Plot: Phoebe easily breaks up with her boyfriend while Chandler is unable to break up with Janice. Chandler breaks the news to Janice and she reacts negatively.\nC Plot: Joey continues to conceal the motives behind the double date. He plants the seeds for Bob to break up with Angela by highlighting Angela\u2019s unappealing traits while he acts as a wingman for Monica. Monica and Angela go to the bathroom together and discuss Bob.\n\nThird Act:\nA Plot: Rachel stands up to the horrible woman proving her independence and Ross and Rachel briefly kiss. Ross then bumps his head on a washing machine door. During the End Tag, Rachel is icing Ross\u2019 head.\nB Plot: Phoebe intervenes in Chandler\u2019s break up and Janice leaves happily. During the End Tag, Chandler runs through the streets celebrating his newfound freedom.\nC Plot: Joey confesses to Monica that Bob and Angela aren\u2019t siblings and the two agree to break the couple up. During the End Tag, Joey and Monica return from their date, overjoyed at having \u201cripped that couple apart\u201d.\nEveryone is basically in the same position as they were in when the episode started. They have gone through minor changes but are ultimately all still sat in the coffee shop together. The story has gone in a circle.\n\u00a0\nOther Examples and Structures\nDan Harmon, creator of Community\u00a0and\u00a0Rick and Morty handily adapted the 3-act structure into a story circle. The situation is allowed to change over the course of the episode but ultimately the characters are unchanged and in relatively the same position.\nHarmon\u2019s story circle is partially based on the \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d and blueprints a successful structure for a sitcom.\n\n1. A character is in their comfort zone or regular situation (the precinct),\n2. But they want or need something else,\n3. They go into an unfamiliar situation or cross a threshold,\n4. The character adapts to the situation while facing trials and obstacles,\n5. Finding what they wanted, whether they like it or not,\n6. But the new situation \u201ckicks their ass\u201d and forces them to pay the price,\n7. Then they return to their familiar situation (the precinct),\n8. The events of the episode have changed them. In sitcom, this is rarely drastic.\nSitcoms are only 22-30 minutes long and thus the story structure is compressed and the story is almost on fast forward.\n\u00a0\nWrite What You Know \u2013 But Make it Funny\nOne of the most common pieces of advice that people seem to tell you when writing is to write what you know. This is also true in sitcom, but as always, it doesn\u2019t mean you can only write about yourself.\nTake funny situations that happen to you and put your characters in the same situation, adapt the story of your life. If you meet someone that makes you laugh \u2013 write a similar character to them in to your medieval sitcom.\n\u00a0\nHow to Actually Write A Sitcom Script\nIn terms of how to write a screenplay, the writing process of a sitcom script is similar to any other script. However, there are a few ways in which a sitcom script may vary. Consider the following elements of a sitcom script:\n\\* The Cold Open \u2013 This is an opportunity to include a joke which doesn\u2019t play into the rest of the episode as a comedic hook to draw in a new audience.\n\\* The End Tag \u2013 Very similar to the cold open but at the end of the episode. Often it is a payoff to a small set-up from earlier in the episode. But it can also be an entirely original joke involving one or two characters (Troy and Abed often serve this purpose in Community).\n\\* Use of Flashbacks/Cutaways \u2013\u00a0Family Guy, 30 Rock and most mockumentaries frequently use flashbacks and cutaways for quick punchlines and gags.\n\\* Callbacks and Running Jokes \u2013\u00a0Arrested Development\u00a0is a particularly excellent series for having jokes that pop up in different iterations throughout the series. It\u2019s a kind of language that show itself will create and repeatedly use throughout.\n\\* Fast Paced Scenes \u2013 Scenes in sitcoms are rarely long, 1-2 pages per scene or set-up is fairly standard as it keeps the pace moving quickly and you can move on to the next joke or comedic setup quickly.\n\u00a0\nRe-Draft to Make It Funnier\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your script, workshop it with people. Read it through aloud and see which bits are funny and which bits need work. Then, re-write, re-read, re-workshop your script.\nThis process will have developed it into something that, at the very least, you and your workshop find funny. If it makes you laugh, chances are it\u2019ll make a few other people laugh.\nPerhaps more than most genres, comedy is hard to get right without finding out if it works with an audience. This is even more relevant in a sitcom. So sharing your work with others and seeing how it plays to a room (however big or small that room may be) is a vital step in the process.\n\u00a0\nAnd Finally\u2026 Don\u2019t forget to Defy Genre\nWhen writing a sitcom, remember to innovate and create a genre hybrid. Combining elements of different genres and forms can create interesting and exciting new ideas.\n\\* What We Do In The Shadows, for example, combines a house-share, a mockumentary and a world in which supernatural creatures exist.\n\\* Peep Show\u00a0takes a flat share and gives the main characters internal monologues.\n\\* Community\u00a0takes a number of different genres and uses them throughout the series to create different innovative episodes within the sitcom genre.\nInnovation makes the sitcom and your script stand out. This guide has given you the outline of what a sitcom is, how it works and how to write one.\nIt\u2019s also important to know that as with everything else, these rules can and sometimes should be broken. If you want to write a sitcom about a pizzeria then do it. If you want to stray further from the norms and set this pizzeria in a medieval kingdom, that is your prerogative.\nInnovation is important and so is enjoying what you\u2019re writing. So write what you know, and write what you like. If your enthusiasm for the idea jumps off the page, then it will be of interest to like-minded people.\nSitcoms are there to make us laugh, comfort us and re-unite us every night with characters we\u2019ve grown to know. It\u2019s vital that in a genre with these intentions, these elements are baked into to the writing."}]}

{"timestamp": 8570, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3502, "Output Length": 88, "prompt": "EXERCISE 2\nThe Bridge\nThe bridge accomplishes several things. It wakes up the gluteal muscles (the big muscles in your buttocks). It reinforces spinal stabilization. It builds endurance and strength in the muscles on the front and back of the core. And it is the precursor to doing a proper squat, which comes later in the book. \nDo the bridge as follows:\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Bend your knees and put your feet in a flexed position so that your heels are on the ground and the balls of your feet and toes are off of the ground as pictured.\nStep 4: Squeeze your buttocks together as if you were trying to pinch a coin between them.\n\nStep 5: Here\u2019s the tricky part: Using the glutes, lift your hips/torso off of the ground without moving your lower back. You should not articulate the spine and roll up \u201cone vertebra at a time.\u201d You want to do the opposite of that. You want to lift the torso in one solid piece while maintaining your neutral spine. No movement should take place in the lower back.\nStep 6: Hold for five to ten seconds (remember these are suggestions. Hold to your tolerance in the beginning, with ten seconds being your goal). You should feel the muscles in both sides of your buttocks working relatively equally.\nStep 7: Lower your back down to the starting position without losing your neutral spine. Again, do not articulate the spine on the way down. In other words, do not roll the spine down onto the floor one vertebra at a time.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 2 through 7, and do five to ten reps, with ten being your long-term goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Hamstring cramping. If your hamstrings cramp (the muscles that run down the underside of your thighs), gently push your feet into the floor away from you before you lift your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Knee pain. If one or both of your knees hurt, lightly press your knees outward before lifting your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Unable to maintain neutral spine. Start by trying to lift your hips/torso only an inch off the ground. Slowly progress to a full bridge over the next few weeks.\n\u2022 Unable to feel glutes working. Go to Chapter 13. Then come back and start with the following regression.\n\u2022 If your back hurts with this exercise, proceed to the Buttock Squeezes regression on the next page. Try these for a few days or weeks and then come back and try the bridge again, making sure to follow instructions meticulously. If your back still hurts, you may have a spinal condition like severe stenosis that makes you sensitive to extension in the spine. If this is the case, this exercise might not be for you.\nCommon Mistakes\nThe most common mistake for back patients with the bridge exercise is that they use their hamstrings instead of their glutes to bring the hips up into position. If your hamstrings are cramping, then you aren\u2019t using your glutes enough. Go to Chapter 13 and practice \u201cwaking up your glutes,\u201d and then come back to this exercise and try it again.\nREGRESSION\nButtock Squeezes\nIf you don\u2019t have the strength or control yet to perform a single bridge exercise properly for any amount of time, start with buttock squeezes.\n1. Lie on your back, with arms at your side, knees bent, feet hip-width apart.\n2. Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your buttocks together as if trying to squeeze a coin between them.\n4. Hold for ten seconds.\n5. Do ten reps.\nPROGRESSION\nOne-Leg Bridge\nOnce you have mastered the bridge and are able to do it with relative ease and with no discomfort in the back, you may want to progress to the one-leg bridge. You do not have to progress to this exercise. Depending on your spinal condition and your fitness level, you may not need to progress this far. This progression is for those who are reasonably fit and plan to be very active in sports, exercise, or outdoor activities.\n1. Follow all rules for the bridge.\n2. Once your hips and torso are off the ground, give extra care to make sure your core is braced as firmly as possible.\n\n3. Slowly extend one leg at the knee without letting the hips/torso drop on that side. You will feel the glutes of the other stabilizing leg kick in as you extend the leg.\n4. Hold five to ten seconds.\n5. Slowly bring the extended leg back to the bent-knee starting position. (Do not lower your hips/torso while doing this. Maintain the bridge position with a neutral spine until your foot is back on the floor.)\n6. Slowly lower your hips/torso back to the starting position on the floor without articulating the spine.\n7. On the other side, repeat Steps 1 through 6, making sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your core in place before extending the leg at the knee.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 When you go to one leg, it is easy to \u201ccock\u201d your hips to one side, to make it easier. Don\u2019t do that. Keep your thighs parallel during the whole exercise. If you can\u2019t, you aren\u2019t strong enough yet for this exercise.\n\u2022 Regarding extending the leg as you come up/bending the leg down as you go down: Make sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your spine before you try to extend the leg. Conversely, make sure you bring the leg all the way back in before coming down to the starting position.\n\u2022 Do not bring the thigh of the extended leg up. Make sure your thighs remain parallel so that you have to use the gluteal muscles to keep the pelvis stable.\nEXERCISE 3\nCrunch and Plank\nWe discuss these two exercises together because they both do a lot of the same things, and some of you will not get to the plank and that\u2019s okay. The plank will take you a bit further toward returning to strenuous activities, but the crunch is enough to get you out of pain. The purpose of the crunch and the plank is to build endurance and strength in the abdominal wall (crunch and plank) and glutes and lats (plank) and to increase spinal stability. Very few back pain sufferers are strong enough to do a plank properly in the beginning and must do crunches for a while before attempting the plank.\nCrunch\nFirst of all, this exercise is not a sit-up. Sit-ups (the traditional \u201cArmy sit-up,\u201d where you pull yourself into a full sitting position) have been proven to be very risky to the spine. They run dangerous loads through the lumbar discs. If you wanted to develop a way to herniate a disc in a lab, a sit-up would be a good candidate for it. Crunches, unlike full sit-ups, do not allow movement in the lumbar spine. Your lumbar spine stays in neutral throughout.\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Place your hands behind your head, if possible. If you can\u2019t, because of shoulder discomfort, that\u2019s okay. Find a comfortable position for your hands.\nStep 4: Gently draw your chin in toward your neck, giving yourself a \u201cdouble chin.\u201d Hold this position throughout the exercise.\nStep 5: Slowly and carefully raise your shoulder blades and head toward the ceiling an inch or two, giving a moderate squeeze in the abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your lower back. Keep a neutral spine; this will be harder than you think. Only bring your shoulders off the floor as far as you can without moving your lower back. The max distance, when you\u2019re great at it, would be no more than, say, four inches.\n\nStep 6: Hold five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nStep 7: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your lower back.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 1 through 7, for five to ten reps, with ten being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u201cMy neck hurts.\u201d First, you shouldn\u2019t be pulling your head with your arms. Your arms/hands are there only to provide a little support to your head and neck. Make sure that you pull your chin in toward your neck before initiating the exercise. This will engage your deep neck flexors that support the spine. If this does not relieve neck pain, move to the Regression.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 The most common mistake is flattening or (worse) rounding the back. It is crucial that you not make this mistake. Doing crunches while continually rounding or flattening the back will promote spinal instability, the opposite of our goal. Details matter!\n\u2022 Chin jutting. If your chin is poking out toward the ceiling with each rep, you are not stabilizing your cervical spine and your neck extensors are taking over. Make sure to draw the chin in toward your neck before each rep.\nREGRESSION\nAbdominal Contractions\nDo this exercise until you build up enough abdominal strength to accomplish the crunch.\n1. Start in the same position as for the bridge.\n2. Place one hand behind your lower back and one hand inside your front hipbone beside your navel.\n3. Squeeze your abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your back. You should feel your back being still with one hand and the abs engaging with the other hand.\n4. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n5. Repeat for several reps until fatigue sets in.\nPROGRESSION\nPlank\nOnce you have mastered the crunch and are able to do crunches with relative ease and without pain or movement in the lower back, try the plank. This is a great exercise to build increased core stability, endurance, and strength. Some of you (especially those with severe stenosis) may never be able to do a plank. That\u2019s okay. Give the plank a try, and if it doesn\u2019t work for you, stay with crunches. If you do go on to the plank, follow the directions closely; most people do this exercise incorrectly.\n\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent and palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders.\n5. Lift your knees off of the floor so you are now on your toes and forearms.\n6. \u201cTraction\u201d your forearms into the floor. In other words, press them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and down toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n\n7. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n8. Slowly put your knees back down first. Do not let your hips/pelvis go to the floor first; this would put your back into extension and may cause pain.\n9. Repeat Steps 1 through 8, for two to five reps, with five being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my lower back.\u201d Some people just can\u2019t do a plank. Even if they do it the right way, it still aggravates their back. If you can\u2019t do a plank, drop it and stick with crunches. But first, be sure that you can\u2019t do it. For example, if your lower back is hurting, try sticking your buttocks in the air a little more. It could be that your hips are sagging toward the floor, putting your back into extension. Also, make sure the core is fully engaged before moving from knees to toes. Lastly, make sure you are squeezing your buttocks, which will support the lower back. If none of that works, forget it; stick with crunches.\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my shoulders.\u201d Make sure you are tractioning your forearms down into the floor and back toward your toes. This engages the supportive muscles of the rotator cuff. If this doesn\u2019t help, try the regression that follows.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 Feet and legs are not together, which makes gluteal engagement more difficult.\n\u2022 Back is up but the hips are dropping toward the floor. This will cause back pain in people with conditions such as stenosis or facet syndrome.\n\u2022 You\u2019re forgetting to pull shoulders back and forearms into the floor with chin jutting. This will cause an increase in pressure in the shoulders and/or neck, resulting in shoulder and neck pain.\nREGRESSION\nPlank on Knees\nIf you aren\u2019t quite ready for plank but think crunch is just too easy, try this one.\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent, palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders (see illustration, for the plank).\n5. Traction your forearms into the floor, pulling them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and back toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n6. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nEXERCISE 4\nDynamic Hamstring Stretch\nCAUTION\nThis exercise may irritate symptoms of people with active radiculopathy, such as severe leg/foot pain, and numbness or tingling in the legs or feet. If you have these symptoms, start with caution; you may not be able to do this exercise. If this exercise exacerbates your leg or back symptoms, skip it for now and come back to it when the symptoms are resolved.\nThe dynamic hamstring stretch helps to improve mobility in the hips and also helps to reinforce and strengthen your ability to maintain a neutral spine while moving the legs. It also builds endurance and strength in the core.\nStep 1: Lie on your back and find neutral spine.\nStep 2: Brace the core to lock in neutral spine.\n\nStep 3: Bend one leg at the knee with your foot flat on floor. Straighten out the other leg onto the floor, with foot flexed (toes pointed up).\nStep 4: Carefully raise the straight leg without losing your neutral spine; in other words, make sure your lower back isn\u2019t flattening into the floor as your leg comes up. To check, put one of your hands underneath your lower back and feel for movement. Raise the leg only as high as you can without flattening your back into the floor. \nStep 5: Do ten to twenty repetitions on each leg. Do as many as needed to feel that you have mildly stretched your hamstrings and worked your core.\nCommon Mistake\nFlattening the back into the floor as you bring the leg up. Remember, one of the most important points of these exercises is to teach you neutral spine/spinal stability. You do not want to accomplish an increase of movement speed at the expense of spinal stabilization. Bring up your leg only as high as you can without flattening your back or bending your knee. Increasing hamstring flexibility will come with time.\nEXERCISE 5\nSide Plank\nThe side plank works the muscles on the lateral (side) parts of the core, such as the obliques, gluteus medius, and quadratus lumborum. This exercise is a very important one. I mention this because almost everyone hates doing it. But don\u2019t give up: Your back depends on it. Many readers will not be able to do this exercise at first because their core is weak. Don\u2019t worry. There are regressions (easier exercises) for those of you who can\u2019t do this one yet.\nStep 1: Start by lying on your side, propped up on your forearm, with your elbow under your shoulder. Relax the other arm for now. Pull your lower arm shoulder blade inward toward your spine and downward toward your buttocks, engaging the lat muscles.\nStep 2: Drop your hips back a bit so that they sit behind your feet and shoulders."}]}

{"timestamp": 8607, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 4594, "Output Length": 30, "prompt": "Following is a youtube video transcript. Can you summarize it for me:\n\n0:00\nso i recommend posting to both airbnb\n0:02\nand vrbo regardless of what air dna says\n0:05\nwhere people are mainly listing in your\n0:06\narea if you don't what i'm talking about\n0:08\nhere here when you come and this is on\n0:09\nthe free version as well it'll show you\n0:11\nwhere hosts are listing their properties\n0:12\neither airbnb or vrp or both regardless\n0:14\nof what it says i think it's important\n0:16\nto be diversified on both platforms you\n0:18\nknow most cases most of your bookings\n0:19\nwill come from airbnb but you know again\n0:21\nit never hurts to be diversified you\n0:22\nknow reason being even if you get 10 to\n0:24\n20 of your bookings from vrbo that's\n0:26\nmoney that you're leaving on the table\n0:28\nand later in this training i'll be\n0:29\nshowing you how to automate your\n0:30\nmessaging and calendar on both platforms\n0:32\nanyway so i'll just take the few extra\n0:33\nminutes it will take to post a vrbo as\n0:35\nwell now before we jump in make sure to\n0:37\ncreate a brand new email for both\n0:38\nlistings just like we did when creating\n0:40\na separate bank account for your\n0:41\nbusiness same idea here we want to\n0:43\nseparate your personal from your\n0:45\nbusiness as much as possible to keep\n0:46\nthings clean now posting your listing is\n0:48\npretty intuitive and both platforms walk\n0:50\nyou through step by step but i'm going\n0:51\nto share a few things along the way that\n0:52\nare important to note this is just a\n0:54\nlittle tip that i picked up along the\n0:55\nway for whatever reason if you have a\n0:57\nsignificant other heck even if it's your\n0:59\nmom i would list their name here on the\n1:01\nlisting if you have a female name people\n1:02\nlike to book and it creates a layer of\n1:04\ntrust that i don't really understand but\n1:06\nonce i started putting my wife's name in\n1:08\nhere it seemed to get more booking so\n1:10\nyou know again this is one of those\n1:11\nplacebo things that i feel like is\n1:12\nworking so if it ain't broke then don't\n1:14\nfix it all right so let's go in here\n1:16\ncreate a new listing and again something\n1:17\nthat airbnb is shifting over to is\n1:20\ncreating a unique experience and so\n1:22\nwhatever you know you're going to be\n1:23\ndoing so let's say you're doing an\n1:24\napartment and then you also want to\n1:26\ndescribe what kind of place that you're\n1:28\nin so let's say we have a loft here\n1:30\nentire place and then let's say you know\n1:32\nwe want to pick your address let's say\n1:35\nit's right here let's say you can fit\n1:36\nsix people you can have four beds and\n1:39\nthey're say it's two-bedroom and then\n1:41\nyou wanna make sure you come in here and\n1:42\njust pick all of the different amenities\n1:44\nthat your place has you know especially\n1:45\nif it's an apartment then you wanna go\n1:47\nin here check all the amenities that\n1:48\nyour apartment offers and then you can\n1:50\ncome in here and just click all these on\n1:52\nagain this isn't gonna be the full\n1:53\ncomprehensive amenities that you can\n1:55\ninclude there's a lot more that you can\n1:56\nadd after you post your listing live all\n1:58\nright now this is super important and\n1:59\nthis is where your professional photos\n2:01\nwill come into play i'll use one of my\n2:02\nlistings photos to show you how i would\n2:04\nrearrange them depending on how i think\n2:06\nthey look and which photo really grabs\n2:07\nthe attention of the user the most so\n2:09\nhonestly this has done a pretty good job\n2:11\nof kind of choosing which photos to\n2:13\nchoose first anyway this one would\n2:14\ndefinitely be my feature photo just\n2:16\nbecause you know the tall you know\n2:18\ntongue and groove here on the ceiling\n2:19\nyou know it has really good contrast\n2:21\nreally pops you know we have this little\n2:23\naccent fireplace right here as well and\n2:25\nit really highlights you know that the\n2:26\nfurniture is really nice and clean and\n2:28\nit's really just a really good picture\n2:30\nand it's done really well for us this is\n2:31\nactually our first picture on our actual\n2:33\nlisting but you want to pick the best\n2:35\nfive photos that you have and you're\n2:37\ngoing to have anywhere from 30 to 50\n2:39\npictures so what i'll do here next and\n2:41\nlet's just take a look to see what we\n2:43\nhave okay so the next picture that i\n2:44\nwould like to do i'm gonna use this\n2:46\nmaster bedroom photo here it has the\n2:48\nblue borton band wall here that really\n2:50\njust pops out in pictures then i really\n2:51\nlike that to use as my second photo the\n2:53\nnext photo that i'll use here because we\n2:55\nhave the game room in this property this\n2:56\nis another good one just because you\n2:58\nknow shows that it's going to be a fun\n2:59\nenvironment if you have kids that you\n3:01\ncan have your kids go downstairs and\n3:02\nplay and hang out in the game room area\n3:04\nso i think this would be a good third\n3:06\nphoto the next photo that i'm going to\n3:07\nuse is use this you know outdoor area i\n3:10\nthink this is a really cool photo you\n3:11\nknow because people don't want to be\n3:12\nconfined in their space when they go on\n3:15\nvacation i also want to highlight that\n3:16\nthey can have this you know cool little\n3:18\noutdoor deck area where they can just\n3:19\nkind of hang out and chill and then we\n3:21\nneed one more so out of these photos i'm\n3:23\ngoing to use this one right here and\n3:24\nthen for the last photo here i'm going\n3:25\nto use this kitchen again because it\n3:27\nhighlights the tongue and groove it\n3:28\nshows that the kitchen's you know nice\n3:30\nand updated and then we have this long\n3:32\ntable here with this little breakfast\n3:33\nnook so i definitely like these five\n3:34\nphotos and what this will do it's really\n3:36\ngonna highlight your five best moments\n3:38\nin the house and that's how you wanna\n3:39\nthink of it when you choose your photos\n3:41\num this is really important so how this\n3:43\nwill look and i'll show you what it\n3:44\nlooks like on my actual listing so when\n3:46\nyou come in here it's going to have your\n3:47\nmain photo here and then it's going to\n3:49\nhave the other four photos here on the\n3:50\nright where you can you know highlight a\n3:52\nlittle bit more and then they can show\n3:53\nall photos and they can go down here so\n3:55\nat the time of this recording airbnb has\n3:56\nactually updated their algorithm and\n3:59\nwhen you go to the front page now this\n4:01\nis what it looks like so it doesn't have\n4:03\nany of the titles here it basically just\n4:04\nshows you where the airbnb is located\n4:07\nand then you can come in here and you\n4:08\ncan search by national parks cabins so\n4:10\nyou can't be unique with the listing\n4:12\ntitle anymore but that doesn't mean that\n4:13\nit's not important i'm just going to\n4:15\ncome in here and just kind of copy what\n4:16\ni've done with my one of my other\n4:17\nlistings here so you want to just make\n4:19\nit unique you know it's kind of\n4:20\nhighlight a few things because when the\n4:21\nperson actually clicks on your listing\n4:23\nthen you'll be able to see your title\n4:25\nbut when you're actually searching for\n4:26\nproperties you won't be able to see it\n4:28\njust shows you the location of where\n4:30\nit's at so you want to highlight the\n4:31\nvibe of your place so if it's unique\n4:33\nstylish you can just pick those and then\n4:35\nyour description is going to be really\n4:36\nimportant as well this is where you can\n4:38\nyou know tell a story about you know\n4:40\nwhat exactly your listing is going to do\n4:42\nand you know we have some examples that\n4:43\nyou can use on our listings that will\n4:45\nshare essentially what you want to do\n4:46\nthe format that we like to take here so\n4:48\nwe'd like to have you know a quick you\n4:50\nknow three sentence high level overview\n4:52\nof what you'll be experiencing if you\n4:53\ncome to our property and then we'd like\n4:55\nto do a bullet point list of all of the\n4:57\nthings that we offer and then we also\n4:59\ncome in here and just kind of describe\n5:00\neach uni if they want to dig a little\n5:02\nbit deeper into each part of the house\n5:03\nthey can just come in here and read all\n5:05\nthis so again you can copy this if you\n5:06\nwant and just kind of make it your own\n5:08\nright so so for here you know we don't\n5:10\nwant to worry about pricing in airbnb we\n5:12\ndo all this on price labs which i'm\n5:14\ngoing to share with you in a later\n5:14\nmodule so what you want to do is come in\n5:16\nhere and increase the pricing by at\n5:18\nleast three times what you normally\n5:19\nwould charge and the reason i do that is\n5:21\nonce you hit live your listing is going\n5:23\nto start showing up on the algorithm the\n5:25\nalgorithm actually favors people that\n5:27\njust have a brand new listing and it\n5:29\nputs it on the front page and so you\n5:31\ndon't want someone to come in here and\n5:32\nbook your listing at a really great\n5:34\ndiscount that's why 3x the price of what\n5:36\nmy normal base price would be so i can\n5:37\ncome in and update all of our software\n5:39\nautomations and tools and then super\n5:41\nimportant you want to offer this 20\n5:43\ndiscount for your first three guests and\n5:45\nwhat this will do it's gonna start\n5:47\nsnowballing get your reviews that way\n5:48\nyou can get started on a good foot and\n5:50\nreally get your bookings in right away\n5:51\nand again there's two different\n5:52\nstrategies that you can use so what i\n5:54\npersonally like to do is i like to\n5:55\nincrease the price by you know anywhere\n5:57\nfrom 15 to 20 percent of my base pricing\n6:00\nbecause you know when people see that\n6:01\nthey're getting a 20 discount\n6:02\npsychologically even if it's not really\n6:04\na discount they think they're getting a\n6:06\ngreat deal because they see the 20 off\n6:08\nyou can offset the discount by\n6:09\nincreasing your price so essentially\n6:10\nyou're netting the same i've also seen\n6:12\nother people lower the price and get\n6:14\nbookings that way just so they can start\n6:15\ngetting reviews i like to increase my\n6:17\nprice and that the same because i feel\n6:18\nlike your listing is optimized with\n6:20\ngreat photos and a great listing\n6:22\ndescription then you're gonna get\n6:23\nbookings if you're put on the front page\n6:25\nanyway so that's the way i like to look\n6:27\nat it but again that's completely up to\n6:28\nyou so then you wanna you know make sure\n6:30\nthat you come in here and you know if\n6:32\nyou have security cameras you want to\n6:33\nlist that come in here review your\n6:34\nlisting once you're ready publish your\n6:36\nlisting and then go in and unlist it\n6:38\njust because we're going to onboard a\n6:39\ncouple of software automation tools\n6:41\nfirst before we go officially live so a\n6:43\ncouple things to note for the amount of\n6:44\nguests that i allow and\n6:46\nthe rule of thumb that i like to use is\n6:48\ni like to put one person per every 100\n6:50\nsquare feet of your property and also\n6:52\ndepends on the amount of rooms that you\n6:54\nhave and also it's going to depend on\n6:55\ndifferent regulations and laws in your\n6:57\nspecific area some places no matter how\n6:59\nbig it is will only allow you know six\n7:01\nguests or eight guests you have to make\n7:03\nsure you know those regulations and laws\n7:05\ni like to use four mattresses don't use\n7:07\nblow up mattresses because those you\n7:08\nknow can pop they always deflate no\n7:10\nmatter you know how well you take care\n7:12\nof them so you can use floor mattresses\n7:14\num you can also use the pull out couches\n7:16\nit really depends on your area and i'll\n7:18\nshow you what your budget is again\n7:19\ncreating a great listing description is\n7:21\nreally important because it really sells\n7:22\nthe guest on your listing and what i\n7:24\nlike to do is i like to go on the front\n7:26\npage of my area that i'm going to be in\n7:29\nand see what the top performers are\n7:30\ndoing and kind of take inspiration here\n7:32\nand there and make it your own obviously\n7:34\ndon't just copy them verbatim but you\n7:36\nwant to see what the top performers are\n7:37\ndoing and then i know i'm going to get\n7:38\nasked this question as well we like to\n7:40\nuse a strict cancellation policy on ours\n7:42\nand then cleaning fee you want to make\n7:44\nsure that you pad yours anywhere from 15\n7:46\nto 30 percent because the guest is going\n7:47\nto be paying this anyway obviously\n7:49\nthat's going to depend on the cleaner if\n7:50\nyou find a great cleaner that charges a\n7:52\nlittle bit more than what your\n7:54\ncompetition is charging i think it's\n7:56\nworth having them just because you'll\n7:57\nhave less headaches down the line and\n7:59\nagain i always like to pad my cleaning\n8:00\ncosts just because i use that as\n8:02\nreserves for maintenance repairs you\n8:04\nknow anything else that might come up\n8:06\nand also to tip my cleaners as well and\n8:08\nthen another really important thing you\n8:09\nwant to do is you want to charge more\n8:11\nper guest after let's say you know five\n8:14\nto six guests depending on how big your\n8:16\nlisting is and i'll add anywhere from\n8:17\ntwenty to thirty dollars more per night\n8:19\nand what this is going to do this is\n8:21\ngoing to allow you to increase your\n8:22\naverage daily rate just by more guests\n8:24\ncoming in and again people are gonna lie\n8:26\nabout how many guests they're bringing\n8:27\nso you wanna enforce these rules on your\n8:29\nsecurity camera and you wanna see how\n8:30\nmany guests are actually coming in this\n8:32\nis a really easy way to increase your\n8:33\naverage daily rate just because if you\n8:35\nhave you know let's say three more\n8:37\nguests after six that's almost 100 bucks\n8:39\nextra per night that you can charge and\n8:41\nif you have a great listing if you\n8:43\nfollow everything else in this training\n8:45\nyour listing is going to be so optimized\n8:46\nthat people are going to want to book\n8:47\nyour place they're going to pay that\n8:49\npremium to stay at your place so make\n8:50\nsure that you do that so once your\n8:51\nlisting is live you can come in here and\n8:52\nadd a co-host just put that you pay them\n8:54\nzero dollars and obviously you can pay\n8:55\nthem outside of the actual listing but i\n8:57\nwouldn't pay them through airbnb so yeah\n8:59\nso this is how you set that up you can\n9:01\njust add co-hosts and you just add their\n9:03\nemail here"}]}

In a mediation process, a neutral, trained mediator works to help disputants come to a consensus on their own. In arbitration, a neutral, trained arbitrator serves as a judge who is responsible for resolving the dispute.\n\nMediation is appealing because it allows parties to reach a collaborative settlement, but it could end in impasse. Arbitration, on the other hand, can wrap up a dispute conclusively, but it doesn\u2019t give disputants much say in the outcome.\n\nA hybrid approach called med-arb combines the benefits of both mediation and arbitration techniques.\n\nIn this mediation and arbitration hybrid, parties first attempt to collaborate on an agreement with the help of a mediator. If the mediation ends in impasse, or if issues remain unresolved, the parties can then move on to arbitration.\n\nThe mediator can assume the role of arbitrator (if qualified) and render a binding decision quickly, or an arbitrator can take over the case after consulting with the mediator.\n\nIf you are considering med-arb (or arb-med), or if another party has recommended it to you, weigh the potential benefits and concerns carefully. Med-arb has a proven ability to get disputes resolved relatively quickly and amicably, but making a single choice between mediation and arbitration is often be sufficient to meet your needs.\n\nTo learn more about mediation, claim your FREE copy of Mediation Secrets for Better Business Negotiations: Top Techniques from Mediation Training Experts.

Best of all, these starters will hook your reader and keep their eyes on your email.\n\n1. It's not about what you can't do, but what you can do.\n\nStephen Hawking once said, \"However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the things we can't do, the obstacles that stand in our way. But that mindset limits us and prevents us from reaching our full potential.\n\nInstead, focus on what you can do and what you are capable of achieving. It may require a change in perspective or a different approach, but success is within reach.\n\n[Transition to specific strategies or tools that readers can use to overcome limitations and achieve their goals.]\n\n2. Every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nThomas Edison, one of the most inventive minds in history, is quoted as saying, \"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\"\n\nWhen we fail, it's easy to see it as a setback or a defeat. \nBut in reality, every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow. It's an opportunity to explore new possibilities and find new ways to achieve our goals.\n\nSo don't let failure hold you back, instead, embrace it as a step towards success.\n\n[Transition to how readers can learn from their failures and use them to achieve their goals.]\n\n3. Life is a journey, not a destination.\n\nAs Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"Life is a journey, not a destination.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the end goal, the destination we want to reach. But it's important to remember that the journey is just as important as the destination.\n\nLife is about the experiences, the people we meet, and the lessons we learn along the way. So don't rush through it, embrace the journey and enjoy the ride.\n\n[Transition to how readers can find joy and fulfillment in the journey towards achieving their goals, rather than just focusing on the end result.]\n\n4. It's not about being perfect, it's about being authentic.\n\nAs Maya Angelou said, \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in trying to be perfect, in trying to impress others. But in the end, it's about being true to yourself and being authentic.\n\nIt's about connecting with others and making a positive impact, not about being flawless. So don't be afraid to be yourself and let your true personality shine.\n\n[Transition to how readers can be authentic in their journey towards achieving their goals, and how that authenticity can help them connect with others and achieve success.]\n\n5. The secret to success is in small, consistent steps.\nAs Lao Tzu said, \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\"\n\nIt's easy to get overwhelmed by the enormity of our goals, but the key to success is in taking small, consistent steps towards them.\n\nIt's not about the destination, it's about the journey. So don't be afraid to start small, and remember that every step you take brings you closer to your goal.\n\n[Transition to specific, actionable steps readers can take to achieve their goals.]\n\n6. Don't let fear hold you back from pursuing your dreams.\n\nAs J.K. Rowling said, \"It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all.\"\n\nFear of failure is a natural part of the human experience, but it can also hold us back from pursuing our dreams.\n\nBut remember, failure is not the opposite of success, it's just a part of the journey. So don't let fear hold you back, take the first step towards your dream.\n\n[Transition to how readers can overcome fear and pursue their goals.]\n\n7. Embrace change and uncertainty as a part of the journey.\n\nAs Steve Jobs said, \"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.\"\n\nChange and uncertainty are a natural part of life, and they can often be uncomfortable. \nBut it's important to remember that these experiences shape us and help us grow.\n\nEmbrace change and uncertainty as a part of the journey, and trust that the dots will connect in the end.\n\n[Transition to how readers can navigate change and uncertainty in order to achieve their goals.]\n\n8. The road to success is not a straight path.\n\nAs Mark Twain said, \"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.\"\n\nThe road to success is not a straight path, it's filled with twists and turns. But the key to getting started is to break down your goals into small, manageable tasks.\n\nTake the first step and the rest will follow.\n\n[Transition to how readers can break down their goals into manageable tasks in order to achieve success.]\n\n9. Don't let setbacks define you, use them as a stepping stone.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln said, \"My great concern is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with your failure.\"\n\nSetbacks and failures are a natural part of the journey, but it's important to remember that they don't define us.\n\nUse setbacks as a stepping stone, and learn from them to become stronger and more resilient.\n\n[Transition to how readers can learn from setbacks and use them to achieve their goals.]\n\n10. Believe in yourself and your ability to achieve your goals.\n\nAs Helen Keller said, \"Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.\"\n\nBelief in yourself and your ability to achieve your goals is the foundation of success.\n\nDon't let doubt and uncertainty hold you back, believe in yourself and your abilities.\n\n[Transition to how readers can build self-confidence and belief in order to achieve their goals.]\n\n11. Stop living in the past\u2026\nAs the famous philosopher, Socrates said, \u201cThe past is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is a gift. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the present.\u201d\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the past and let it define us, but we must remember that the past is gone and we cannot change it.\n\nThe same applies to the future, we can't predict it, we can only plan for it.\n\nSo stop living in the past and start living in the present. Make the most of the present moment, and use it to work towards your goals.\n\n[Transition to how readers can focus on the present and use it to achieve their goals.]\n\n12. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey\u2026\n\nAs Confucius said, \u201cIt does not matter how tall the mountain is, what matters is the journey to the top.\u201d\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the destination and overlook the journey, but the journey is just as important as the destination.\n\nIt's about the experiences, the people we meet, and the lessons we learn along the way. So don't rush through it, embrace the journey and enjoy the ride.\n\n[Transition to how readers can find joy and fulfillment in the journey towards achieving their goals, rather than just focusing on the end result.]\n\n13. The power of persistence\u2026\n\nAs Thomas Edison said, \u201cI have not failed. I\u2019ve just found 10,000 ways that won\u2019t work.\u201d\nPersistence is the key to success. It's easy to give up when things get tough, but those who persist and keep pushing forward are the ones who achieve their goals.\n\nAs Thomas Edison's quote illustrates, it's not about never failing, it's about not giving up and continuing to try new things.\n\n[Transition to how readers can develop persistence in order to achieve their goals.]\n\n14. Don't be afraid to fail\u2026\nAs Michael Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I\u2019ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times \nI\u2019ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I\u2019ve failed over and over and over again in my life.

{"timestamp": 9116, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1203, "Output Length": 134, "prompt": "Damian, here is an example of a application I wrote, please remember all of the details about me and my (Drongo's) writing style:\n\n Functional neural interfaces (FNIs) is a rapidly expanding, multi-disciplinary field that could potentially revolutionize neuroscience. However, many current FNIs are highly invasive, not feasible in humans, or can only record from, at most, one region of the brain. My research focuses on nano functional neural interfaces (nFNIs) to solve the stated problems. My penultimate goal is to design and safely implement a system that allows for high-resolution, bidirectional communication with the nervous system while being minimally invasive. I\u2019ve been enthralled with creating this system since I was in elementary school. It is a project that will need many interdisciplinary technological advances to achieve, but I believe that such a system would have many extraordinary impacts on both research and society. \n While I am specifically interested in researching nFNIs, I wanted to ensure that I had a wide range of research experience in neuroscience to better myself as a researcher. I had the honor of taking part in the 2020 summer undergraduate research program in Computational Neuroscience hosted by Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Due to the coronavirus, the internship was converted to an online format, which required me to work mostly independently. I worked in Dr. Aaron Batista\u2019s lab under the guidance of his graduate student Erinn Grigsby where another student and I studied \u201cDecoder Performance Classified as a Function of Neurons.\u201d \nIn this study, we investigated the impact of neuron dropping on decoder performance. By utilizing my skills in Matlab, we created three different Kalman filters and linear regression decoders. Each decoder contained different position, velocity, and velocity-position decoders to test, which was the most robust to neuron dropping. Despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus, we virtually presented our work at the Center of the Neural Basis of Cognition. Getting the chance to work in Dr. Batista\u2019s lab was by far the most rewarding experience in my professional career. The experience enriched my ability to decipher papers to find pertinent information. It strengthened my ability to pose a question and find an objective method to answer it. Most importantly, I gained an in-depth knowledge of how brain-computer interface decoders operate and first-hand experience developing and designing them. On top of my other coursework and projects, I am continuing my research into brain-computer interface decoders with my partner, explicitly investigating how modulation depth and preferred direction factor into decoder performance as neurons are dropped. We hope to see if specific neurons are essential for decoding a particular action than other neurons. \nAs part of my senior thesis at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am a part of a team, under the guidance of Dr. Dirk Albrecht, investigating the dosing of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease, dystonia, essential tremor, and epilepsy. Our primary goal is to find a method of optimizing the procedure of finding the correct dosage of frequency, pulse width, and voltage for each unique individual. We aim to conduct this study utilizing C. elegans as a model system because of the animal\u2019s completed connectome. Knowing the connectome may help see the underlying mechanisms that effectively allow DBS to treat the previously stated diseases. We hope that by identifying the underlying mechanisms of DBS, the treatment might be optimized.\nUsing what I\u2019ve learned from my previous research experiences, I am currently conducting a formal independent study into neural nanotransducers. One of the most considerable problems with non-invasive stimulation and imaging of neurons is that signals are dispersed or attenuated as they pass through the skull and tissue matter. Typically, the trade-off for having a stable signal deeper into the brain is by being more invasive. However, in this study, I hypothesize that nFNIs can be used as a relay system to send and receive external devices\u2019 signals. The hypothesis is based on the biomimicry of neurons themselves. In the example of an \u201cimaging\u201d nFNI, it would receive the information of a neuron firing and transduce the signal. A nearby relay nFNI would then relay that signal until it reached the skull where the signal could be read. The process would function conversely for signals sent to a specific neuron. \nMy current theory is nanowires composed of magnetic nanoparticles bound together by a protein chain could act as the relay nFNIs with magnetoelectric nFNIs at the end to send/receive signals. The wire would self-assemble using the proteins, which would also insulate the signal to reduce noise. Ideally, the wire would attach itself to the skull and the targeted neuron allowing for direct stimulation. The exploration of this concept is what I\u2019d like to make into my dissertation at Rice University. Rice has shown to be the pinnacle in regards to nano neural engineering through countless innovations done by its world-class staff. I knew Rice was perfect for me after pouring over the research conducted as I investigated nFNIs. With their guidance, I can use nFNIs to design and implement a minimally-invasive, bidirectional brain-computer interface.\nAfter my time at Rice University, I hope to found a research company centered around research further into nFNIs and making this BCI safely usable by humans. Ultimately, I hope the BCI would be a versatile treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease by allowing direct activation and monitoring of the affected neurons. The BCI could also enhance neuroprosthetics by allowing sensations such as touch to be sent back to the brain. The number of medical and scientific advancements possible with this technology are genuinely countless. The creation of this system will be my life\u2019s work that I have been doing since I was in middle school. I hope to continue this work at Rice University, where I\u2019ll get the guidance I could not receive anywhere else."}]}

YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASeweCcVCmE\n\nTranscript:\n(00:00) do you think everything that happens happens for a reason have you ever thought about the deeper meaning of reality have you ever thought about what is the meaning of life these are some of the questions that have plagued humanity for generations because frankly we don't really know the answers to them but see here's the best part we don't have to know the answer just searching for the answer itself makes us much more wiser and more intelligent than we are right now this is what philosophy can do for you it can show\n(00:30) you how to think how to argue and how to come up to your own conclusions most people think that they don't really need philosophy or they think that philosophy is reserved for the extremely intellectual people but this couldn't be further from the truth let me ask you something do you believe in a religion do you not believe in a religion do you live by a set of moral rules all of these questions can be understood through philosophy but I can understand why some of you might not read philosophy it's usually written in\n(00:58) complex words and even then it can be hard to understand what people are saying that's why in this video I tell you about two concepts that I really liked about philosophy from the French philosopher Voltaire these are the concepts of empiricism and religious tolerance now the philosophy of empiricism basically states that we learn about life only through experience so in order to tell you a little bit about empiricism I'm going to tell you a story called Candide written by Voltaire you may or may not have heard it before\n(01:28) Candide lived in his uncle's palace with his cousin Cunegonde and his tutor Pangloss who was a philosopher now Pangloss was an optimist and he believed that the world we were living in is the best of all possible worlds now Kuna gone and Candide fell in love and then can deeds uncle found out and he kicked Candide out he was then forced into the military and beaten and nearly killed then he was miraculously saved by a man called Steam's and he started to live with him and work for him then one day Candide while\n(01:58) walking on the street notice a really sick man on the street almost about to die and it turned out that it was his old tutor Pangloss Pangloss told him that the army killed his uncle's estate and his beloved hyuna gand now obviously Candide was very depressed when he heard about this eventually Candide James and his tutor Pangloss decided to go to another country and during the course of events James and Pangloss were killed Candide somehow managed to escape and out of a rear turn of events he found Kuna gone again but turns out\n(02:30) she was the slave of two men he then killed both of the men rescued her and then somehow they got separated again so you might have noticed a train here a lot of bad things happened to all the people in the story but ultimately everyone makes it to a small farm in Turkey and they are now safe but turns out that because they're safe they are now bored and they still haven't been able to figure out what the meaning of life was they then decided that maybe the best thing to do was to just work on your garden and that is how you can\n(03:00) truly achieve happiness by just working on your garden this story basically gives us the conclusion that we cannot find happiness by thinking about how the world should be but that we need to take action in our own lives and fix our own lives and maybe then we can find happiness so this story makes us think about a lot of philosophical questions and the thing about these questions is that there is no right or wrong answer but these questions can always serve us as brain exercises the more you think about them the more arguments you can\n(03:30) make for and against the topic the more wise you're going to become now I tell you about the other philosophy that Voltaire really believed in and that was religious tolerance Voltaire always believed in religious tolerance and freedom of speech so the back story is that Voltaire was living in France at the time and in this time there was a lot of religious intolerance in France he used to admire England because at that time they promoted freedom of religion and their society gave birth to one of his idols Isaac Newton so this is\n(03:58) why water actually started to prefer the English society as opposed to where he was born so coming back to religious tolerance I believe that freedom of speech and religious tolerance are the two things that are necessary for any country to develop so we can think about this in very practical terms if history had ever shown that religious intolerance and lack of freedom of speech actually moved a society forward then I would be the first person to support it but never has history ever shown that releases hatred or lack of freedom of\n(04:29) speech has advanced a society in fact whenever a society loses these characteristics it doesn't survive for very long Walter had a famous saying I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it that is the real spirit of a democracy and this is why I believe that we all should be familiar with these concepts of philosophy so we can live in a free and democratic world so my message to all of you who are watching this video is to not take my opinion about anything you don't have to agree with everything\n(05:00) that I say but always remember to think deeply and think very carefully analyze yourself and the world fix yourself become a better version of who you are think for yourself and form your own opinions imagine of what we could achieve if we all started to think this way take care keep learning and keep hope raise your voice against injustice and respect everyone's right to speed that's how we move forward in this world that's all for this video let me know in the comments below if you would like to\n(05:30) learn more about philosophy from the Sun if you like the video then click the like button and subscribe for more thanks for watching\nWrite 3 bullet points of the most importent parts"}]}

{"timestamp": 9179, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2092, "Output Length": 111, "prompt": "Lyft redesign \u2014 a UX case study\n\nI went to a Design Guru Summit workshop on May 17th. At the workshop,\n\nFrank Yoo\n, Lyft\u2019s head of UX and product design at Lyft, talked about the Lyft re-design. I learned useful design insights from his presentation and I wanted to share some takeaways with my design team at work. On May 26th, I met\nVicki Tan\n, Lyft\u2019s product designer, at Tech in Motion + Verizon Present: Data and Design Tech Talk. She generously shared how their design team did A/B testing, and answered a few questions I had regarding their UX challenges. In order to better support my takeaways presentation, I did extra homework by researching more about the re-design online, and then creating a case study.\n\nWorkshop Notes\n1. Lyft 4 year Overview\nYear 1: Market Fit\nYear 2: Unlocking Supply\nYear 3: Growth \u2014 Growth levers, new regions, marketing (data numbers)\nYear 4: Case Study \u2014 Redesign Lyft\n\n2. Lyft Redesign Goals\n\u009a\u2022 Scale for the future\n\u2022 Provide better context\n\u2022 Improve ergonomics and discoverability\n\n3. Lyft Design Principles\n\u2022 Nail the basics \u2014 Clear choice and context\n\u2022 Build confidence \u2014 Consistency and transparent\n\u2022 Be unique \u2014 Own-able and delightful\n\n1\u20133 are notes I took from\n\nFrank Yoo\n\u2019s presentation at the Design Gurus Summit workshop.\n\nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs\nLyft used this concept to define their design principles in a Pyramid shape. I was fascinated by how Lyft integrated psychology to define the principles order of importance.\n\nAs a designer, I often run into situations where people have different ideas about design decisions; it can be tough to judge without any design principles. Therefore, with the encouragement from my colleague\n\nKlara Pelcl\n, I convinced our leadership to let me and\nJules Cheung\ninitiate and collaboratively set core design principles among our design team.\nWe brainstormed together and created our own 6 principles: Know Your User, Clarity, Consistency, Efficiency, Collaboration and Beauty. By looking at Lyft\u2019s design principles graphic, it encouraged me to think about what we can do next to apply them in practice.\n\nOnline Resource\nUX Challenges\nI wanted to know what type of UX challenges Lyft faced while designing the app. I was glad to find some useful resource from Nectar Design, where\n\nFrank\ndid a webinar about how Lyft handles UX challenges, and used the same pyramid method to tackle UX challenges. Here is a summary from Nectar Design:\n\u2022 Usability \u2014 It must solve a compelling user issue\n\u009a\u2022 Reliability \u2014 Everything must work seamlessly and be as transparent as possible (Ex: ride times and costs)\n\u2022 Differentiate \u2014 It must be visually and interactively interesting (Ex: Lyft\u2019s glowing buttons and interactive options menu)\nReasons for Redesign\nDuring the webinar,\n\nFrank\ntalked about the reasons they re-designed the Lyft app, something I wish I could have asked him in person. Again thanks to Nectar Design I was able to find the reasons:\n\u2022 \u009aPoor representation of the driver that is requested\n\u2022 \u009aNo transparency about price or estimated time of arrival\n\u2022 Cars were not directional\n\u2022 \u009aPoor use of color\n\u2022 Options panel awkwardly placed\n\u009a\u2022 Request Lyft is vague for first time users\nSuccess Analysis\nNow you probably want to know what results the Lyft re-design achieved. I might not be able to cover everything here but I\u2019ll share what I have so far.\n\n1. Enhanced Transparency and Safety\nAfter the system matches you with a driver, you can see all the important information you need \u2014 your driver\u2019s name and the color/model of his/her car. More importantly, displaying the driver\u2019s license plate number helps you quickly pick the right car so you know you\u2019re with the right driver.\n2. Better Usage of Primary Color\nFrom what I can see, Lyft uses hot pink as the primary color, and purple as the secondary. During the workshop\n\ntalked about the pink color and how they decided to limit the use of it, applying it only in important situations. My understanding is that they made the pink color an action item color, such as the logo, the \u201cRequest Lyft\u201d button, the destination pin and \u201cFree Rides\u201d on your profile menu.\n\n3. Price Estimate Feature\nThe new UI includes a feature that allows users to get a ride\u2019s quote. By clicking on \u201cPrice estimate\u201d (see the image above), you have a good understanding of how much the ride is going to cost you. For example, a trip to Spicy King restaurant in Chinatown will cost me about $7-$11 from my pickup location.\n\n4. Made It Ergonomic\nErgonomics make the user experience much better. The older app design had actions at both the top and bottom of the screen, which made it harder to use because your fingers had to cross the screen back and forth. What about the new design? I really like it myself as a user for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 Tab Menu\nAll important menu actions are now at the bottom of the app, where you can select a type of ride you need (Carpool, Line, Regular Lyft, Plus and Premier), and you can set a pickup location right after. The UI for further actions in the request flow are also located in the same spot, resulting in a seamless experience.\n\u2022 Lyft Cars\nOn the map, the little Lyft cars were re-designed nicely, with a hint of pink and purple that shows color consistency across the app. Cars now turn directionally, which is a big help to people like me who don\u2019t have a great sense of direction with maps \u2014 I can now easily figure out if the car I requested is heading towards my location or if the driver is going the opposite way (which also explains why sometime it takes longer than the estimated arrival time).\n\u2022 Options Before Car Arrival\nThe new UI provides 4 options (Cancel, Split, Send ETA, Call driver) to users before their car arrives. I remember the hard time I had with the older UI, when I had to call my driver but couldn\u2019t find the button. Ease of use is much greater with all the options displayed up in front.\nUX Research\nLyft has different type of users \u2014 passengers and drivers, how does UX research collaborate with design? As I mentioned in the beginning,\n\nVicki Tan\nshared her insights during the panel at Tech in Motion + Verizon Present: Data and Design Tech Talk, where I learned quite a bit about their research.\n\u2022 Qualitative data vs. Quantitative data\nLike many other companies, Lyft is metrics-driven and focuses on quantitative analysis (usually the numbers and graphs can be shared with the teams and the stakeholders in many formats, such as email, keynotes). However, quantitative data needs analysis to be useful. Because of that, qualitative data comes in handy and that\u2019s what they focus on more now.\n\n\u2022 Gather User Feedback\nAccording to\n\n, Lyft invites real users (both passengers and drivers) to do regular weekly Q&A sessions in the office to ask them questions and listen to their feedback. By doing so, the design team learns if the users understand the features and what can be improved.\nI believe Lyft also uses other methods to collect qualitative data, so I did some research online and it looks like Lyft has been using \u201cLookback\u201d to aggregate a database of experiences where they can generate a montage of user feedback to better understand their needs. I tried \u201cLookback\u201d a few months ago, and found it very easy to record prototype testing on mobile. At my company, our design and UX research team have been using \u201cValidately\u201d to do both moderated and unmoderated testing.\n\n\u2022 A/B testing\nDuring re-design progress, Lyft ran many A/B tests. As a result,\n\nfound that the design they wanted was not the design the users wanted. At work, my design team faces this struggle all the time where we have different assumptions about what works for users the best. Without A/B testing, we are essentially designing features that suit our best interests, and might not be what the real users need.\n\u2022 Outcome\nAccording to Nectar Design, Lyft has conducted hundreds of hours of user testing and validates their assumptions along the way. This is good because it builds confidence in the team, stakeholders, and customers.\n\nConclusion\nHere is what I learned from doing this case study:\n\nOrganizing and structuring design principles is just as important as creating them in the first place. I\u2019ll continue finding ways to better structure the design principles we created at work, and visualize them so that everyone can get a good understanding of it across the organization.\nDon\u2019t be afraid of doing product re-designs. If you have good reasons and understand what the usability issues are, start planning! Get to know your real users \u2014 user testing is the key. Collect as much quantitative user behavior data as you can, then analyze and categorize them to make sure you have solid qualitative data to support re-design thinking. Follow the cycle of design, release, get user feedback and iterate.\nLyft\u2019s re-design is a great example to show how to create a successful product. If you care about your users, put yourself in their shoes to understand what they need and what they actually do when using a product. If you don\u2019t have a UX research team yet, build one or become a researcher yourself! At work, I work closely with our UX research team, they help the design team tons by recruiting users, setting up user testing, and analyzing the massive data comes in every month. Thanks to their hard work, the design team can take over the numbers and metrics, analyze further to define specific usability areas, and to communicate re-design decisions to our leadership.\nLyft\u2019s re-design case study helped me understand how other companies generate business value by implementing great design in both UI and UX. It gives me confidence that if we apply similar principles, and keep doing what we are doing on UX research, our product team can help the company product achieve much more success in the near future.\n\nGive an overview of this case study"}]}

{"timestamp": 9308, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1640, "Output Length": 155, "prompt": "can you tell me if the answer to this question \"The need for achievement based on McClelland's acquired needs theory could be best satisfied by:\na. Becoming an influential leader.\nb. Being accepted by a group\nc. Being well liked\nd. setting/achieving challenging personal goals \n\" is readily answerable from this content \"When your team members succeed, you might be tempted to show them off to the rest of your organization. But while some people thrive in the spotlight, others dread being \"paraded around.\"\n\nManaging a group of people with different personalities is never easy. But if you're managing or leading a team, it's essential to know what motivates your people, how they respond to feedback and praise, and what tasks fit them well.\n\nDavid McClelland's Human Motivation Theory allows you to identify people's motivating drivers. This can then help you to give praise and feedback effectively, assign them suitable tasks, and keep them motivated.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore McClelland's Human Motivation Theory, and look at how you can use it to manage and lead your team more effectively.\n\nNote:\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory is also known as Three Needs Theory, Acquired Needs Theory, Motivational Needs Theory, and Learned Needs Theory.\n\nUnderstanding McClelland's Theory\nIn the early 1940s, Abraham Maslow created his theory of needs. This identified the basic needs that human beings have, in order of their importance: physiological needs, safety needs, and the needs for belonging, self-esteem and \"self-actualization\".\n\nLater, David McClelland built on this work in his 1961 book, \"The Achieving Society.\" He identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. [1]\n\nAccording to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).\n\nMcClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.\n\nThese characteristics are as follows:\n\nDominant Motivator\n\nCharacteristics of This Person\n\nAchievement\n\nHas a strong need to set and accomplish challenging goals.\nTakes calculated risks to accomplish their goals.\nLikes to receive regular feedback on their progress and achievements.\nOften likes to work alone.\nAffiliation\n\nWants to belong to the group.\nWants to be liked, and will often go along with whatever the rest of the group wants to do.\nFavors collaboration over competition.\nDoesn't like high risk or uncertainty.\nPower\n\nWants to control and influence others.\nLikes to win arguments.\nEnjoys competition and winning.\nEnjoys status and recognition.\nNote:\nThose with a strong power motivator are often divided into two groups: personal and institutional. People with a personal power drive want to control others, while people with an institutional power drive like to organize the efforts of a team to further the company's goals. As you can probably imagine, those with an institutional power need are usually more desirable as team members!\n\nUsing the Theory\nMcClelland's theory can help you to identify the dominant motivators of people on your team. You can then use this information to influence how you set goals and provide feedback, and how you motivate and reward team members.\n\nYou can also use these motivators to craft, or design, the job around your team members, ensuring a better fit.\n\nLet's look at the steps for using McClelland's theory:\n\nStep 1: Identify Drivers\nExamine your team to determine which of the three motivators is dominant for each person. You can probably identify drivers based on personality and past actions.\n\nFor instance, perhaps one of your team members always takes charge of the group when you assign a project. They speak up in meetings to persuade people, and delegate responsibilities to others to meet the goals of the group. They like to be in control of the final deliverables. This team member is likely primarily driven by power.\n\nYou might have another team member who never speaks during meetings. They always agree with the group, work hard to manage conflict when it occurs, and visibly become uncomfortable when you talk about doing high-risk, high-reward projects. This person is likely to have a strong need for affiliation.\n\nStep 2: Structure Your Approach\nBased on the driving motivators of your workers, structure your leadership style and project assignments around each individual team member. This will help ensure that they all stay engaged, motivated, and happy with the work they're doing.\n\nExamples of Using the Theory\nLet's take a closer look at how to manage team members who are driven by each of McClelland's three motivators:\n\nAchievement\nPeople motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.\n\nWhen providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right \u2013 and wrong \u2013 so that they can improve.\n\nAffiliation\nPeople motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.\n\nWhen providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.\n\nPower\nThose with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.\n\nWhen providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals.\n\nComparative Theories\nMcClelland's theory of needs is not the only theory about worker motivation. Sirota's Three-Factor Theory also presents three motivating factors that workers need to stay motivated and excited about what they're doing: equity/fairness, achievement, and camaraderie.\n\nSirota's theory states that we all start a new job with lots of enthusiasm and motivation to do well. But over time, due to bad company policies and poor work conditions, many of us lose our motivation and excitement.\n\nThis is different from McClelland's theory, which states that we all have one dominant motivator that moves us forward, and this motivator is based on our culture and life experiences.\n\nUse your best judgment when motivating and engaging your team. Understanding a variety of motivational theories will help you decide which approach is best in any given situation.\n\nNote:\nYou may also see these abbreviations for McClelland's three motivators: Achievement (nAch), Affiliation (nAff), and Power (nPow).\n\nKey Points\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory states that every person has one of three main driving motivators: the needs for achievement, affiliation, or power. These motivators are not inherent; we develop them through our culture and life experiences.\n\nAchievers like to solve problems and achieve goals. Those with a strong need for affiliation don't like to stand out or take risk, and they value relationships above anything else. Those with a strong power motivator like to control others and be in charge.\n\nYou can use this information to lead, praise, and motivate your team more effectively, and to better structure your team's roles.\""}]}
{"timestamp": 9313, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1620, "Output Length": 152, "prompt": "Please generate a list of legislative issues discussed in this article: \nVoters in multiple states acted to protect the integrity of American democracy in Tuesday's elections by rejecting some of the most prominent candidates who embraced lies about the 2020 election and threatened to ignore the will of the electorate.\n\nThese are crucial and heartening results, but urgent work remains to be done.\n\nCongress now should do its part and act, in its final weeks in session, to clarify and strengthen the federal law governing the counting and certifying of electoral votes in presidential elections. It needs to do this before control of the House passes, in all likelihood, to a Republican majority.\n\nThe 135-year-old law, known as the Electoral Count Act, is chock-full of confusing and ambiguous provisions, and legal scholars have long warned that it could trigger a crisis. That's exactly what happened after the 2020 election, when Donald Trump and his associates exploited the law's vague and arcane language to claim that they could overturn the will of the voters. That exploitation led directly to the violence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nSince then, several Republicans have joined Democrats in agreeing that a major reform to the law is necessary -- a rare point of bipartisanship. The Senate introduced reform legislation over the summer, and the House passed its bill in September. While the bills contain minor differences, either would be a huge improvement over the status quo.\n\nThe most significant changes to the law would make it far harder, if not impossible, to pull off the schemes that Mr. Trump and his allies tried to use to overturn the 2020 election and hold on to power.\n\nFor example, the law currently makes it very easy for members of Congress to obstruct and delay the final count of electoral votes on Jan. 6; any objection lodged by one representative and one senator will do the trick. Republicans took advantage of this after the 2020 election, including when Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley introduced meritless objections simply to slow the process. The new bills would raise the bar, by requiring at least one-fifth of both houses of Congress to sign on before an objection can be lodged, and by strictly limiting the grounds for any objection.\n\nThe reform bills would also clarify that the vice president's role on Jan. 6 is purely ministerial, and that, despite Mr. Trump's claims, the vice president has no authority to throw out electoral votes or accept a slate different from the one a state has already certified.\n\nCongress can also do more to protect the integrity of a presidential election before the electoral votes arrive in Washington. What happens in the states, after the ballots are counted, is just as important, if not more so. The 2022 midterms featured multiple Republican candidates for governor and secretary of state, like Mark Finchem in Arizona, who have suggested they would reject the will of their own voters.\n\nArizona voters rejected Mr. Finchem's bid for secretary of state. Similarly extreme Republican candidates for secretary of state have also lost in states including Michigan, New Mexico and Minnesota, and Republican gubernatorial candidates who engaged in election denial lost in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nElection deniers, however, remain a potent force on the right: More than 220 candidates who questioned the 2020 election have won state or federal office, and about 30 of those have said the election was stolen or rigged.\n\nThe reforms proposed in the bills address this threat by making clear that state officials must count their votes according to the state laws in place on Election Day. They may not change the result after the fact simply because they don't like it. Critically, the new bills also steer disputes over vote tallies to the courts, where judges -- not partisan officials -- have the final say.\n\nEven if these reforms pass, they are, like any other law, only words on paper. In order to work, they need to be upheld by those in positions of power, who are committed to acting in the interests of American democracy and the rule of law. Still, both the Senate and House bills are far better than what we have right now, and either one would go a long way to ensuring that the electoral-count law cannot be used as a tool for subverting the election in 2024 or beyond. Congress needs to pass the overhaul now, when it has willing majorities in both houses and well before anyone casts a ballot in 2024.\n\nDemocrats also should move quickly on the debt ceiling and on immigration.\n\nThey should act before the end of this legislative session to ensure that the federal government can borrow the money it needs to meet its obligations over the next two years -- including recent and important increases in federal funding for expanding the production of renewable energy; investing in roads, high-speed internet, unleaded pipes and other infrastructure; and supporting local government, including money for law enforcement. Congress agreed to those measures after months of negotiation and compromise, and Democrats should do everything they can to defend the achievement.\n\nThe government is expected to reach the limit of its congressionally authorized borrowing capacity, known as the debt ceiling, at some point in 2023. For the government to pay its bills, Congress must raise that limit -- but House Republicans have made clear that if the vote is deferred until the next Congress, they will threaten to withhold consent, risking a global financial crisis to compel the White House to accept reductions in federal spending.\n\nIt's a serious threat: Republicans have engaged in similar brinkmanship repeatedly in recent years, most notably in 2011, when the possibility that the government might fail to meet its obligations produced a measurable increase in the interest rates the government must pay to borrow money, costing taxpayers an estimated $1.3 billion. That standoff also imposed limits on federal spending that delayed the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nDemocrats could avert the immediate danger by raising the debt ceiling high enough to permit necessary federal borrowing until after the next presidential election. But there is no reason to preserve the debt ceiling as a problem for future Congresses. Democrats can end this dangerous game by passing the legislation to eliminate the debt ceiling that has been introduced by Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado. There is simply no reason for Congress to vote again on spending that already has been authorized.\n\nSome Democrats worry that eliminating the debt ceiling would expose them to charges of fiscal recklessness. And not just from Republicans. President Biden just last month described the proposed elimination of the debt ceiling as ''irresponsible.'' The president's choice of words was misguided and deeply counterproductive. Preserving the debt ceiling is a reckless and dangerous policy cloaked in the appearance of responsibility.\n\nFinally, the broken state of the nation's immigration system is an issue urgently in need of congressional action, and one on which there is a plausible path forward. In the closing weeks of the current Congress, members from both parties should restart negotiations on legislation to fix one particular piece of the immigration system: The process by which migrants claim asylum.\n\nThis board has endorsed the framework of a deal put forward last year by Republicans, including SenatorJohn Cornyn of Texas, and Democrats, including SenatorKyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The core of the bill would significantly increase the government's capacity to process asylum claims, by allowing those with a legitimate fear of persecution to settle safely in the United States and by making it more difficult for those without legitimate claims to enter or remain in the country.\n\nThe bill also offers a road map for cooperation on other issues over the next two years. It is narrowly focused on a specific problem; the solutions it puts forward would require significant compromise on both sides, and for both sides, it improves on the status quo. Even as the current Congress wraps up its work, those who will remain, and those who will soon be joining them, can start looking for other issues on which progress may still be possible."}]}
{"timestamp": 9344, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1258, "Output Length": 135, "prompt": "Simia\nSimia is a tiny planet the size of a large moon, orbiting a star on the border of the Luxian Empire. The planet is a warm, humid place, covered almost entirely in untamed jungles. While signs of ancient civilizations are scattered around the planet, currently only one area is inhabited: a pocket of land about the size of a large city, surrounded by a ring of nearly impassable mountains that the inhabitants call the Holy Ring. This is where the only extant civilization on the planet - the Simians - lives. The untamed jungles outside the mountain ring are full of dangerous wildlife that rarely pass through the mountains, making the interior area very safe.\n\nSimian society is rather primitive, comparable to the Bronze Age on Earth. The Simians travel by foot or by riding on tamed beasts of burden from their jungles. They live in wooden \u201ctreehouses\u201d mounted on pillars, or literally built in trees in the more rural areas. These treehouses are connected by swaying rope bridges that allow the inhabitants to move between buildings without touching the ground.\n\nThe Simian society is patriarchal in nature, and their religion is woven into the very fabric of their everyday lives. Even the Holy Ring is believed to be supernatural in nature, as the inhabitants believe their gods raised up the mountains to give them a safe place to live away from the wild beasts outside. They also believe the royal family is directly descended from Shi Huo, the Simian god of war and trickery, through a mortal that he took as his original mate, so the only living member of the \u201csacred bloodline\u201d - Prince Wukong - is revered both as a ruler and as a partially divine being.\n\nThe Simians value individual freedom very highly. This manifests in several of their cultural practices. For example: because Simians believe that the union between a couple is private and no one needs to be involved but the couple, they have no concept of marriage, much less one sanctioned by religion or government. Instead, they simply choose a mate and begin living together.\n\nThe Simians also value the ability to fight and hold one\u2019s own in a battle. Their people have historically had to fight many wild beasts to survive, and while an appearance from one of those beasts is much rarer now, the cultural emphasis on being a warrior still holds strong. This manifests in their religion as well, as Shi Huo is the deity most commonly worshiped.\n\nFinally, although the Simians have no idea, the Luxian Empire has been observing their civilization for quite some time now in preparation for invasion.\nSimians\nSimians are short, monkey-like creatures with long tails and fur. They are bipedal and though they are capable of running rapidly on all fours, they usually prefer not to. Their fur and eyes come in varying shades of brown, black, or flaxen. They usually keep their fur relatively short because of their warm environment, but will sometimes allow it to grow longer, especially on their heads, for the sake of looking attractive. They average 5 feet in height and 55-65 years in lifespan. They are small, light, and fast, and are excellent climbers and swimmers. They often use their tails as an additional limb.\n\nThe Simians wear clothing comparable to that of ancient Chinese peasants or, depending on their social status, semi-nobility. Most lower-ranking monkeys wear simple tops and trousers that don\u2019t get in their way as they work and climb. Fancier clothing for special occasions, or that worn by nobility, consists more of flowing robes and elaborate decorations. The priests and priestesses wear blue and white, while the royal family tends to dress in variations of red and gold. The fighters wear bronze breastplates with intricate designs, and the temple guards have a slightly fancier and lighter version of the breastplate purely for ceremonial purposes. Every Simian, regardless of their social status, has certain patterns or characters embroidered into their clothing. Some are believed to bring good luck. Others represent devotion to the gods. Others might represent the wearer\u2019s family history.\nSimian Religion\nThe Simians believe in three gods: Shi Huo, the \u201cStone Monkey\u201d warrior trickster god, and the first deity to appear; Kwamya, the merciful mother goddess of healing and blessings, and the second deity to appear; and Tapanga, the fierce protector goddess of perfect balance, daughter of Shi Huo and Kwamya. Their religion teaches that Shi Huo originally had a mortal mate, and the semi-divine children they had together became the current Simian royal bloodline. When the mortal mate passed away, Shi Huo took the goddess Kwamya as his new mate and Tapanga resulted from their union. Their relationship forms the basis of the Simian practice of taking mates.\n\nRituals and traditions play an important role in the Simian religion. Most of the worship centers around a large stone temple in Huaguo, the Simian capital city, and many minor shrines are scattered throughout the Ring. The Simians observe holidays such as the solstice, the birth of Tapanga, the creation of the Ring, and more, often with huge festivals.\n\nThe Simians also believe that the Holy Ring was created by the gods to keep the wild beasts or \u201cmonsters\u201d out of their home. Their ancient stories tell of a world rocked by chaos, where monkeys lived in constant fear of being eaten alive by unbeatable monsters. One day, the sky opened up and Shi Huo descended, wiping out many of the monsters after a fierce battle. He then led the surviving monkeys into war against the other beasts and drove them away. Afterward, he conjured up the mountains around their new home to protect them.\n\nBecause the Simians believe their royalty is descended from Shi Huo, the priesthood and the royal family are closely linked. In more recent years, the priests have begun gradually assuming more and more power for themselves and attempting to control the actions of the royal family. To their chagrin, the current heir to the throne - Prince Wukong - couldn\u2019t care less what the priests tell him to do."}]}
{"timestamp": 9355, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2257, "Output Length": 190, "prompt": "One of the most significant criminal enquiries undertaken at Cardiff Docks was a case involving large quantities of drugs brought from the West Indies. It was a lengthy investigation that began with the death of a scuba diver whose body was recovered from the Queen Alexandra Dock.\n\nDuring March 1982, several anonymous telephone calls were received about a man alleged to have gone missing while using sub-aqua diving gear at the docks. Calls were made both to the South Wales Police and to the British Transport Police at the docks, initially by a female and later by a male. With each call, more details emerged- the man was described as West Indian and the location was given as the Queen Alexandra Dock.\n\nSearches by Police Underwater Search Teams did not find anything. Visibility in the dock was extremely poor and as they worked, huge conga eels slithered and scraped past the divers- it was not a pleasant experience in the inky blackness. When HMS Cardiff put into docks on a courtesy visit the opportunity was taken for a sonar sweep to be carried out. Once again nothing was found- what happens to a human body submerged in water depends on many things and the chances of finding one were minimal.\n\nHowever, some weeks after the calls began, two tugs were assisting a ship leaving the Queen Alexandra Dock and as they took up the tow their powerful screws churned up the water and a body was flushed to the surface. It was a body dressed in sub-aqua diving gear and was showing signs of having been in the water some time. At the mortuary, with the diving gear removed, it was found to be that of a West Indian male and all the circumstances suggested that this was the missing man. The heavy diving gear may also have been why the body had not surfaced earlier. A conference between senior officers of the South Wales and British Transport Police did not find agreement on whether the death should be regarded as suspicious.\n\nThe post mortem examination was carried out by eminent pathologist Professor Sir Bernard Knight, who found it difficult to establish the cause of death. But significantly, none of the tiny microbes known as diotodes, normally present in water, were found in the bone marrow possibly indicating the deceased did not die from drowning. There were also several interesting marks on the body, the significance of which would become apparent later. A square bruise was seen on the right side of the face and a similar one on the chest. There was also an unusual wide mark on the left wrist. One other piece of vital evidence came from examination of the diving equipment; the valve on the oxygen cylinder was closed, pointing to the fact that diving had been completed by the time the death occurred.\n\nDI Vic Miller began an investigation and looked for a connection with the West Indies. The shipping line Geest operated between South Wales and the West Indies and one of their boats- the MV Geestland had been diverted into Cardiff Docks a few weeks earlier, about the time the diver had gone missing. Crucially, it had unloaded its cargo of bananas on the north side of the Queens Dock, exactly where the body had been brought to the surface by the tug! The Geestland was brought back into Cardiff and dry docked and something very significant was quickly found. A length of chain was discovered hanging below the hull near the propeller. It was about 20 feet long and on the end was a shackle secured with a nut and bolt. That answered a question that had been puzzling the officers ever since the body had been found; an unexplained spanner had been discovered tied to the wet suit chest. When the spanner was matched to the shackle, they were an exact fit. And one of the Geestland\u2019s engineers told of hearing a strange metallic sound coming from the hull during the voyage from the West Indies. A picture was emerging and the police suspected that a container had been secured to the ship\u2019s hull before the vessel left the West Indies and was to be recovered when the ship arrived in the UK. The dead diver was apparently part of a well-organised drug running syndicate!\n\nFollowing a different line of enquiry, the man who had made the anonymous calls was traced and he identified the deceased as his friend- Peter Macdonald Jones. The dead man\u2019s mother told police that he had had a girlfriend known as \u2018The Duchess\u2019 who worked at a department store in Reading. At the store, a former employee was tracked to South Wales and enquiries at a store in Cardiff found that a new member of staff had recently been distressed; she had confided to a colleague that her boyfriend had died. Back in Reading, enquiries established that there were connections to some fairly undesirable people involved in the local drug scene.\n\nThe woman, known as \u2018The Duchess\u2019, was arrested and immediately lied about her identity. Realising she may have made a mistake she fell silent and remained that way throughout an initial interview. She was taken home for a search of her flat in Newport. At first, nothing incriminating was found nor was there anything to link her to Peter Jones or even to Reading. Seemingly, she was a woman without a past but as the search progressed, officers noticed that the only indication of any wealth in the flat were two original paintings by L.S. Lowery on the lounge wall. DI Miller examined the paintings and took the back off them. Between the canvas and the backboard of one was a photograph of Peter Jones and in the second was a photograph of her and Peter together. Here was the connection the police had been searching for.\n\nWith her boyfriend dead, The Duchess could see that she had nowhere else to go and her best option now was to help the police. Over time, DI Vic Miller established a rapport and her story was slowly unravelled; it proved to be a revealing story indeed. She had been set up in the flat by her boyfriend, Peter Jones, and his associate, James Timothy for the purpose of providing \u2018a safe house\u2019 for drug importation operations in South Wales. Jones was a married man and lived in Reading as did Timothy, who was believed to be heavily involved in the drugs underworld. Almost every month she would meet the two men and a canister of drugs would be recovered from a ship bringing bananas from the West Indies. She would fetch the drugs from the docks and drive them to an address in Reading, having been given a cover story in case she was stopped. The operation had been going on for nearly five years, and each consignment meant anything up to \u00a3500,000 in street value. It was understood that no-one involved in the drug trafficking should display any outward sign of wealth. Recently though, Peter Jones had begun to deviate from the rules and shortly before he died he had put down a \u00a35,000 deposit on a Porsche motor car. He had also purchased a plot of land in a residential area in Barbados and was having a bungalow built. It was not a wise move; Timothy had learned of the deposit on the car from an associate in Reading\n\nBoth Timothy and Jones were experienced divers and on that March night in 1982 they set out on one more drug recovery operation from beneath a ship. They were probably expecting the Geestland to be at Barry Docks but bad weather made Cardiff a preferred option. It was a foul night when The Duchess drove Peter Jones and James Timothy to Cardiff Docks- a gale was blowing and it was lashing with rain- in many respects perfect conditions to undertake their hazardous activity, safe from casual observation. The men changed into their diving gear and as usual it was arranged they would be dropped off by The Duchess who would return later to avoid having the car attract attention. Through the rain and the darkness, she watched them descend the steps into the uninviting water and then left; she would not see Peter Jones again.\n\nThe Duchess returned at the prearranged time but Timothy came back to the car alone. He had his diving kit but there was no sign of any drugs and he was vague and evasive about what had happened to Peter Jones. As they waited for around half an hour The Duchess became angry and began to panic, believing that Timothy had done something to him. Eventually, she drove Timothy to Newport, intending to go back and look for Jones in daylight. Timothy led her to believe that an argument had taken place about the drugs and that he had ended up hitting Jones with a lead diving belt and he had fallen back into the water. Timothy had returned to the car believing that Jones would get out alright, but obviously he had not. The Duchess made enquiries herself amongst other drug dealers to see if Jones had been heard of but she did not go as far as reporting her missing man to the police.\n\nWith the discovery of the body the investigation had intensified. One aspect concentrated on the enquiry to trace and interview Timothy, whilst others took on many of the other lines of enquiry including the Reading connection. Many long hours were spent as enquiries spread the length and breadth of the land. Officers learnt that both Peter Jones and James Timothy had contacts in the West Indies and had recently visited the islands. There was evidence that Timothy and Jones had been associates for ten years at least and both had bought diving equipment from the same shop in Falmouth five years previously.\n\nBy the middle of June, Timothy had been arrested, taken to Cardiff and interviewed at the BTP Divisional HQ. But throughout the interview he made no reply except to indicate he did not wish to answer questions. His reply was always the same and he never once lost his cool or became perturbed- he simply remained silent. Despite the serious allegations, Timothy was allowed bail and was interviewed on a further five or six occasions. The only variation from his veil of silence was an occasional stock answer- \u201cI have never murdered anyone in my life. I have the highest regard for human life.\u201d\n\nThe truth about the events that took place in the dark on the quayside at the Queen Alexandra Dock between Jones and Timothy has never been established. The police investigation had always been led with a murder or manslaughter charge in mind but although there was plenty of circumstantial evidence it was insufficient to bring a charge of homicide. No drugs were ever recovered by the police as a result of this incident, nor were any seen by The Duchess when she collected Timothy. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that there were no drugs there to be recovered. Had Jones or someone else intercepted the haul when the vessel was at an American port during its voyage? And if this was not the first consignment to go missing, was someone doing a bit of freelance work, in the USA perhaps? It may be significant that Jones\u2019 passport showed that he had recently returned to the UK from Barbados via Florida.\n\nJames Timothy was charged with conspiring with Peter Macdonald Jones and others to import controlled drugs at Cardiff Docks. He pleaded not guilty at Cardiff Crown Court but was convicted and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. No person was ever charged in connection with the death of Peter Macdonald Jones, the dead frogman of Cardiff Docks."}]}

This product was easy to clean prior to first use. Grinds coffee beans very well but it is very messy. The grinds stick to the cup and when I pour it into my coffee machine fine grinds fall all over the counter and floor. Also, after each use I need to tip the grinder over and tap it so the extra grinds fall onto the counter. The photo shows how much I cleaned up after grinding 8 cups. The video shows what I have to do after I grind coffee each time. It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot but I make 12 cups every night and sometimes 8 cups in the afternoon. Lots of coffee drinkers at my house.If you don\u2019t mind the mess this is a terrific grinder, but I don\u2019t like the mess and waste. \n6 people found this helpful \nFast grinder with static issues! \nBy James Head, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on April 21, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nThe grinder is very fast and quiet so kuddos are worthy there. The problem is when you try and pour the grounds into your filter. The static electricity in the canister is terrible and half of my grinds stick to the sides. When I pour them out, they end up all around my filter area and enter the water reservoir. I can\u2019t recommend this grinder for this reason. It has good qualities ie quietness and speed but the static would stop me here. \n6 people found this helpful \nDesign Flaw \nBy Michael, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on September 21, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nIt's not rocket science, it's a coffee grinder and it does a good job grinding. My issue is with the Coffee Powder Container. You have to literally use your fingernails on both hands to pry the container from the Grinder Body. Not impossible to remove, but requires some effort and you will spill grinds ! To correct, I drilled a hole in the powder container and installed a regular drawer pull knob to aid in pulling out the container. In addition, I removed the Coffee Powder Container Lid and tossed it. Now it's much easier to remove. \n3 people found this helpful \nMakes a huge mess \nBy RMC, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on May 22, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nThis works and it more quiet than the Cuisinart Burr grinder, which I last had. The biggest issue is that this thing makes a huge mess when you pull out the coffee grounds holder after being ground. I mean like everywhere. I plan on modifying the removable lid and that should help out a lot, but we will see. Works great otherwise, but they definitely designed and manufactured before trying it themselves or they probably would have changed up the lid layout so it wouldn't make the mess it does. It's a great grinder besides that, but the mess it makes is simply unacceptable to me at least. \n2 people found this helpful \nAverage quality.

The hopper is light weight plastic and the controls are cheap. The burr grinder itself seems to be good and it grinds beans smoothly.The biggest problem I have with this product is that it is difficult to clean. The ground coffee seems to get trapped between the burr and the receptacle leaving stale coffee behind. \n2 people found this helpful \nUpdate: Great grinder- read the instructions \nBy Kelly, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on November 10, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nUpdate: the more I use it, the messier it is. It works best for just a small batch. I was trying to grind large batches to give away ground coffee as gifts and it was super messy. really like this grinder. I would encourage you to read the instructions first. There are some parts that need to be put together in a very specific way, but it is easy to figure out. It isn\u2019t the easiest one to clean, but I really love the way it grinds the beans. I love the collection bin too. It doesn\u2019t make a mess like so many others.

Even the coarsest setting is still a fine ground. Wish the hopper held an entire bag of beans. Wish it had antistatic as the coffee dust gets on everything. However it's working for what I need for now so I'm keeping it. Update: I do occasionally need to shake the unit to get beans into the grinder. Also, I find the container the holds the grounds an akward shape. It is very hard for me to remove, (I have grip issues) I wish it had a match or handle instead of relying on grasp to remove. \nOne person found this helpful \nHardly Satisfactory for Espresso. \nBy CM, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on October 28, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nIm certain this product is better for your typical coffee grinds, I would not call this acceptable for espresso grinds.As you can see, the grind is nowhere near as fine as it should be, and this is on the finest setting.

I tried medium at first and it came out very fine so my coffee was very strong that day. For the grind to be ok for my pour over I have to use the setting at course. The good side of it is that I get to use less coffee beans, but the not good part of it is that I had to change my normal routine for making it and it took me about 4 days to get it right. :) \nOne person found this helpful \nGood but MESSY \nBy Amazon Customer, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on April 16, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nWe've been grinding coffee for years - decided to upgrade to a conical grinder - maybe they all do this.

Is it a deal breaker? Ya, I'm gonna try another, the mess is just unbelievable \ud83d\ude2d shame because I do like the rest of it, it's compact, quiet and holds a good amount of beans in the reservoir. \nOne person found this helpful \nGrinds ok, but annoying to use \nBy B. Andalora, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on December 23, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nThis is my first burr grinder. I bought it because I got an espresso machine and my blade grinder didn't grind the beans finely enough. The grinder seems no noisier than my blade grinder. It grinds the beans ok. I don't have any problem with static, as some reviewers mentioned.However, my two issues with this grinder are:\\* The beans don't funnel down into the grinder very well. You start the grinder and assume the beans are all ground when it stops. But usually the beans aren't all ground. I have to continuously shake the machine to get all the beans through the grinder. I saw other reviewers also mention this issue.\\* The bigger issue for me is that the hopper the ground coffee goes into is nearly impossible to get off! Both my husband and I have difficulty removing it. I have to use a hard, thin plastic spatula to pry it out. This is so annoying, I might return the grinder. I'll see if it gets any easier over time. \nHopper Design Could Be Better \nBy Desert Rat, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on December 17, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nThis was ordered because our Cuisinart was sounding like the years had taken a toll on it. It still ran.The only complaint I had with the Cuisinart was the selector for the amount of coffee it would grind (Timer) was finicky and sometimes required cycling the power to the device in order for it to run.This Sboly has a control that seems to work without issue so far.What I don't like is the hopper that holds the ground coffee. It is rounded and not easy to detach without using fingernails to grab the edges of the hopper.Also coffee seems to collect on all sides like static is holding it and I use a paper funnel to keep grounds from spilling all over as I pour into the coffer filter in it's basket.There is no safety switch to keep it from running with the lower hopper removed. The Cuisinart will not run with either the top or lower hopper removed. \nNot without issues \nBy Gani, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on January 11, 2023 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW"}]}
{"timestamp": 9509, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1760, "Output Length": 159, "prompt": "Grade this essay [The comparison of standards of the cities and small town or villages has been always a debate. Recently, teenagers choose to live in the cities rather than their home villages because of school or job opportunities. This essay will discuss multiple reasons behind this trend and explain why the advantages of being in a city do indeed outweigh its drawbacks.\n\nThere are several reasons to desire living in urban areas. Firstly, it gives people an opportunity to study in better schools which cannot be found in rural areas. Since in the modern world education means very much for people\u2019s future, it is crucial to have higher education degrees for those individuals to find well-paid jobs. In addition to that, city life provides people with completely different experiences than their home villages. Thanks to the schools, work or social gathering places, they get to meet a greater number of people from all around the country compared to their rural towns which is crucial for one\u2019s personal development. Lastly, in the cities, not only they get bigger number of job options, but also they can earn larger amount of money. It is very well know that job market is significantly limited in the villages also the current jobs barely pay enough.\n\nIt is clearly seen that benefits of leaving villages outweigh its few number of deficits. It is worth to mention that people face some issues, such as being away from their extended family, more competitive and challenging job market, and substantially more expensive living cost, when they move to the cities. Advantages like learning and exploring new experiences, getting a better education leading to a better paid job and having an interesting career, however, surpass the number of the drawbacks of this development.\n\nTo conclude, there are various reasons for young generation to leave their homes to live in the cities and this movement\u2019s benefits easily outweigh its disadvantages.\n\n] based on this criteria [Band 9\nTask response\nFully addresses all parts of the task\n\nPresents a fully developed position in answer to the question with relevant, fully extended and well supported ideas\n\nCoherence and cohesion\nUses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention\n\nSkilfully manages paragraphing\n\nLexical resource\nUses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features;

A text version of the lesson is below for your convenience. You can also get the entire course in audio format here.\n\nGo to Next Lesson\nView Previous Lesson\n\nThe Power of Method-Centric Marketing\nIf I was to start any new digital product or service-based business from scratch, I would ALWAYS start with this.\n\nNot having this one thing is the reason why most people struggle with overwhelm, indecision, and lack of clarity in their business.\n\nIt's also the reason why people struggle to become known in their industry as a true expert who can demand high prices and easily sell their products and services.\n\nCould Adding This One Simple Thing Almost Instantly Position You in the Top 20% of Your Field?\nIt's unfortunate, but the fact of the matter is that the people at the top get the majority of the business.\n\nThe top 20% of marketers get 80% of the business while the bottom 80% of marketers fight over the remaining 20%.\n\nI said \"marketers\" for a reason.\n\nBecause it's not enough to just be good at your craft. It's not enough to just be creative or genuine in your desire to help others.\n\nNo, you need to be good at marketing also.\n\nI'm gonna share one thing with you today that will make that a whole lot easier and help you prosper even if you're not great at sales or marketing or are not a huge fan of the fact you have to do it.\n\nThe Many Benefits of Method-Centric Marketing\nThere's ONE thing you can implement in your business (regardless of experience level) that will make your entire journey far easier.\n\nHere's a list of what having this can do for you and your business:\n\n\u200bMakes you instantly stand out in the sea of noise online, so your message can start consistently attracting paying customers.\n\u200bGreatly reduces any feelings of \"imposter syndrome\" and makes you immediately more confident in sharing your message.\n\u200bPositions you in the eyes of others as a true expert instead of a \"fake guru\" or newbie marketer who can\u2019t be trusted.\n\u200bPre-sells clients on working with you so that you never have to do sales calls or \u201chard sell\u201d ever again if you don\u2019t want to.\n\u200bGives both you and your customers total clarity on how you can provide real results in a unique way worth paying for.\n\u200bAllows you to charge more money for what you do and still have people happy to buy from you instead of the \"competition\"\n\u200bProvides you with the entire curriculum of what you need to teach/share inside both your free and paid content.\n\u200bAutomatically increases the value and conversion rate of ANY offer you create while also making it far easier to sell.\n\u200bMakes your business extremely efficient and also adaptable to your unique personality and creative preferences.\nAll This is Possible With a S.O.U.R.C.E Methodology\nYes, one thing can do all this. It's called your S.O.U.R.C.E Methodology\n\nS.O.U.R.C.E stands for:\n\nSignature Solution\nIt\u2019s what you become known for in your industry and what becomes the primary profit-center of your business.\n\nOne-of-a-Kind Offering\nIt\u2019s what makes your solutions uniquely valuable and what differentiates you from the competition.\n\nUnified Understanding\nIt\u2019s what helps you deepen your understanding of your topic and also streamlines your business growth strategy.\n\nRoadmap to Results\nIt acts as the roadmap that helps both you and your paying clients go from where they are to where they want to be.\n\nCredibility & Confidence\nIt\u2019s what makes you a true expert (without ever having to call yourself one) and helps you overcome imposter syndrome once and for all.\n\nEver-Evolving\nIt grows and evolves as you do, so your business always stays aligned with who you are and adapts to your ever-growing wisdom.\n\nSo what is a SOURCE Methodology exactly?\n\nHere are some examples of what a SOURCE Methodology might end up looking like:\nPremium Shapes (1) jpg\nThink of your SOURCE Methodology like a central database of all your knowledge, organized into a step by step system that informs all your business decisions.\n\nFrom your SOURCE Methodology comes:\n\n\u200bYour social media content ideas\n\u200bYour signature product or service\n\u200bYour entire offer suite\n\u200bYour teaching method\n\u200bYour unique selling proposition\n\u200bYour lead generation and scaling strategy\n\u200bYour roadmap for getting clients results\n\u200bAnd much more\nWhy is it so important to have this in your business?\n\n1. Because SYSTEMIZING your knowledge is how you gracefully SCALE your business and serve more people.\nMost people are stuck trading their time for money. Even entrepreneurs are on the hamster wheel. Only those who are great at creating systems can find ways to escape this.\n\n2. Because OBSCURITY is one of the biggest things holding most people back from the success they desire.\nMost people just aren't that good at getting known and positioning themselves as someone worth following.\n\nHaving your own one-of-a-kind system based on your unique life experience instantly helps you stand out from everyone else so you can start being known as a true expert at something instead of just some random person on the internet trying to grow their side hustle.\n\n3. Because it gives you extreme CLARITY, and clarity leads to more effortless action and momentum.\nYour SOURCE Methodology is the foundation of your business. It's what determines exactly what you post on social media, what you use as lead magnets, what your paid products are, and how you sell them.\n\nIt acts as the roadmap you use to get both yourself and your clients great results. And it's what positions you as the expert in your field.\n\nWithout this one thing, everything in your business will feel more difficult and confusing. With it, you'll have far more clarity and confidence.\n\nHow to Turn Your Methodology Into 1,000 Leads Per Month and a Thriving Digital Product Business\nWith that said, how do we use this to drive real results and achieve the 1,000 leads per month I talked about in the first lesson?\n\nThat's what we'll talk about in the next video.\n\nClick \"Next\" to keep learning.\n\nGo to Next Lesson"}]}

Collis goes on to say\nThe Incumbent\u2019s Mistake\nCEOs of established companies often pay too much attention to defining how their firms will capture value and too little to new ways to create value and how firms\u2019 activities and capabilities need to evolve over time. One reason is that approaches focusing on capture (like the five forces) have been very successful in long-established and stable industries and as a result have become ingrained in the strategy process. But CEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking? When did it allow us to become the \u201cdisruptive\u201d innovator?\n\nLook at the list of the most valuable companies in the United States, and you\u2019ll see that discovering and exploiting new business models to satisfy previously unmet, unexpressed, or even unknown customer needs is where the action has been in recent years. Those companies didn\u2019t collectively create trillions of dollars in value by outpositioning their rivals. When they were founded, they didn\u2019t have rivals. Indeed, the kind of businesses they started didn\u2019t exist previously.\n\nWinning with a New Business Model. The most valuable companies in America all launched brand new business models that met previously unfulfilled or unidentified needs. Here are the five largest U.S companies by market cap, as of April 12, 20 21: One: Apple, founded in 1976, now worth 2 point 2 trillion dollars. Two: Microsoft, founded in 1975, now worth 1 point 9 trillion dollars. Three: Amazon, founded in 1994, now worth 1 point 7 trillion dollars. Four: Alphabet, founded in 1998, now worth 1 point 5 trillion dollars. Five: Facebook, founded in 2004, now worth 880 billion dollars. Source: Yahoo Finance\nThe good news for leaders of incumbent companies is that the emergence of new approaches doesn\u2019t have to doom their enterprises. Indeed, if they take a holistic perspective on strategy, they may discover that those business models present attractive opportunities because they create more value.\n\nFor example, would you rather make a onetime sale of a physical product or build a long-term client relationship and deliver tailored solutions that generate more value for the customer and potentially much more profit for you? As some old-line companies have discovered, the latter is the opportunity that new digital business models offer firms that can effectively leverage data and analytics. Komatsu now offers subscriptions to its Smart Construction platform, which coordinates all the activities of a construction site, including drone surveys, dumptruck scheduling, and the operation of autonomous earthmoving equipment. The platform cuts construction projects\u2019 entire costs by well over 15%\u2014creating far more value than the revenue from the sale of bulldozers, which was all that was available in Komatsu\u2019s previous model. In a somewhat similar fashion, Siemens uses artificial intelligence to predict, and so prevent, maintenance issues on its trains. The improvement in uptime performance allows it to switch to performance-based contracts for rail service that bring in thousands of dollars a day, rather than just the initial price of a train.\n\nNo incumbent should respond to every new business model\u2014that would simply be playing whack-a-mole. Instead, a firm must develop a strategic approach to identifying the value-creation potential of models and then determine whether to pursue any new ones by predicting the outcome of competition among alternative models.\n\nBy using available tools, strategists could have foreseen, for example, that video on demand (streaming) would replace Netflix\u2019s original mail-order delivery of DVDs and Blockbuster\u2019s old-fashioned video stores. The superiority of the value proposition for the job to be done for the customer, which was \u201cdelivering personal video entertainment,\u201d suggests the absolute dominance of streaming. An examination of the purchase criteria you might consider\u2014convenience, the ability to make an impulse purchase, access to recent best sellers, a large back catalog\u2014reveals that video on demand serves customers better than either of the earlier business models. If that weren\u2019t enough, the cost of delivering movies and TV shows over the internet is vastly lower than doing so via physical stores or the mail. Considering those advantages, it\u2019s no wonder that almost everyone is now paying monthly subscription fees to streaming services.\n\nWhy Streaming Video Beat Rival Models. Its value proposition was much stronger than the propositions of video stores and DVD-by-mail on almost every dimension, and its costs were far lower. Streaming video excelled on price, convenience, variety of titles, immediate access, availability of best sellers, functionality on multiple devices, variety of media delivered, and ability to connect to other applications and platforms. DVD-by-mail excelled only on variety of titles. Video stores did not excel on any dimension. The cost of delivering a video to a customer was only 25 cents for streaming in 2007, but 1 dollar and 25 cents for DVD-by-mail and 2 dollars and 24 cents for video stores. Source: Author analysis, \u201cNetflix in 20 11,\u201d an HBS case study by Willy Shih and Stephen P. Kaufman\nIn contrast, a similar analysis suggests that Amazon\u2019s online business model, which consists of a retail website, a limited number of fulfillment centers, and fleets of delivery trucks, will never fully displace Walmart\u2019s longtime business model, which features traditional brick-and-mortar stores supplied by a national network of distribution centers. When you compare how well each does the job to be done, you see that Amazon\u2019s model is good at providing home delivery for a very broad range (hundreds of millions) of items, while Walmart\u2019s is better for immediate availability at low cost of a more limited number (a few hundred thousand). Each business model has a distinctive proposition that appeals to different customers on different occasions for different products. And a comparison of the cost positions of their asset bases shows that Walmart\u2019s logistics system is low cost for everyday items that consumers pick up in stores in rural or suburban locations, while Amazon\u2019s is more efficient for long-tail items and home delivery in densely populated geographies. Neither business model universally dominates the other. Both will survive, which is why each company is rushing to replicate the other\u2019s asset base, with Amazon buying Whole Foods, and Walmart spending billions of dollars to expand online and add fulfillment centers."}]}

Maxwell](https://waiyancan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Today-Matters-By-John-C.-Maxwell-705x300.jpg) \n\nNovember 20, 2021 November 20, 2021\n\n#### \\*\\*Today Often Falls to Pieces\\*\\*\\*\\*\u2014 What Is the Missing Piece?\\*\\*\n\nSuccessful people make right decisions early and manage those decisions daily.\n\nThe earlier you make those right decisions and the longer you manage them, the more successful you can become. The people who neglect to make those decisions and to manage them well often look back on their lives with pain and regret\u2014no matter how much talent they possessed or how many opportunities they once had.\n\nI believe that everyone has the power to impact the outcome of his life. The way to do it is to focus on today. Benjamin Franklin rightly observed, \u201cOne today is worth two tomorrows; what I am to be, I am now becoming.\u201d You can make today a good day. In fact, you can make it a masterpiece.\n\n#### \\*\\*Today Can Become a Masterpiece\\*\\*\n\nYou will never change your life until you change something you do daily.\n\nwill never change your life until you change something you do daily. You see, success doesn\u2019t just suddenly occur one day in someone\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds life. For that matter, neither does failure. Each is a process. Every day of your life is merely preparation for the next. What you become is the result of what you do today. In other words . . .\n\n\\*\\*YOU ARE PREPARING FOR SOMETHING\\*\\*\n\nThe way you live your life today is preparing you for your tomorrow. The question is, What are you preparing for? Are you grooming yourself for success or failure?\n\n\u201cYou can pay now and play later, or you can play now and pay later. But either way, you are going to pay.\u201d The idea was that you can play and take it easy and do what you want today, but if you do, your life will be harder later. However, if you work hard now, on the front end, then you will reap rewards in the future.\n\nThe only adequate preparation for tomorrow is the right use of today.\n\nIs it fun to do? Not especially. Often the practice is quite tedious. Does it work? Absolutely.\n\nIt seems obvious to say that good decisions help to create a better tomorrow, yet many people don\u2019t appear to connect their lack of success to their poor decision making. Some people make choices, then experience negative consequences, yet wonder why they can\u2019t seem to get ahead in life. They never figure it out. Others know their choices may not be good for them, but they make them anyway. Such is the case with the alcoholic who keeps drinking excessively or the person who engages in one abusive relationship after another.\n\nNobody says that good decisions are always simple, but they are necessary for success. Theodore Hesburgh, former president of Notre Dame University, admonished:\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re EASY;\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re CHEAP;\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re POPULAR;\n\nYou make decisions because they\u2019re RIGHT.\n\nYou begin to build a better life by determining to make good decisions, but that alone is not enough. You need to know what decisions to make.\n\n1. Attitude: Choose and display the right attitudes daily.\n2. Priorities: Determine and act on important priorities daily.\n4. Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines daily.\n5. Family: Communicate with and care for my family daily.\n6. Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking daily.\n7. Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments daily.\n8. Finances: Make and properly manage dollars daily.\n10. Faith: Deepen and live out my faith daily.\n11. Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships daily.\n12. Generosity: Plan for and model generosity daily.\n13. Values: Embrace and practice good values daily.\n14. Growth: Seek and experience improvements daily.\n\nIf you settle these twelve issues by making the right decision in each area and then manage those decisions daily, you can be successful.\n\n#### \\*\\*Making Today Matter\\*\\*\n\nRate Yourself on the Daily Dozen: Look at the following list of the Daily Dozen and rank how well you do them. Put a \u201c1\u201d beside the one you do the best, a \u201c2\u201d beside the one you\u2019re next best at, and so on until you\u2019ve ranked your skill in them from 1 to 12.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Attitude: Choose and display the right attitudes daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Priorities: Determine and act on important priorities daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Family: Communicate with and care for my family daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Finances: Earn and properly manage finances daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Faith: Deepen and live out my faith daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Generosity: Plan for and model generosity daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Values: Embrace and practice good values daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Growth: Desire and experience improvements daily.\n\nVerify Your Self-evaluation: Talk to a friend who knows you well and ask him or her to confirm how you evaluated yourself. If your friend ranks your strengths and weaknesses differently than you do, discuss your differences of opinion and make adjustments to the rankings as needed.\n\nPick Two Strengths: Pick two strengths from your top six to work on. Make sure that you have made the necessary decision for each area. Then begin practicing the daily disciplines in that area to make it a part of your life. Use the exercises at the end of the chapter to help you if desired.\n\nPick One Weakness: Choose a weakness from your bottom six to work on. Again, make sure you have made the decision for that area and begin practicing the daily disciplines that go with it.\n\nReevaluate: After sixty days have passed, reevaluate yourself in the three areas in which you\u2019ve been working to improve. If you have made significant progress in an area, move on to something new. If an area still needs more work, remain focused on it for another sixty days. But don\u2019t work on more than three areas at a time, and never work on more than one weakness at a time.\n\nRepeat: Keep working on areas until you have the entire Daily Dozen under your belt.\n\nOnce you have made all the key decisions and each of the disciplines has become a habit in your life, then the Daily Dozen will be second nature to you. When these disciplines are woven into the fabric of your life, you will be able to make today your masterpiece. And when you do that, tomorrow will take care of itself.\n\\_\\_\\_\nErstelle 12 Entscheidungen f\u00fcr die man sich t\u00e4glich Entscheiden sollte in folgendem Format:\n- [ ] Heute entscheide ich mich, dass"}]}

It is spearheaded by the Department of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). In 2015, all 193 United Nations Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \n\nFor Canada, the 2030 Agenda calls for concerted efforts to build an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future, a secure world founded on human rights and the rule of law, free from poverty and hunger. One with full and productive employment and access to quality education and universal health coverage, where gender equality has been achieved, culture and diversity are celebrated, and the environment is protected.\n\nAt the core of the 2030 Agenda are five key elements\u2014people, prosperity, planet, partnership and peace\u2014 all supporting sustainable development that leaves no one behind. Central tenets include:\n\nThe 2030 Agenda is universal in nature and applicable to every country; the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs are as relevant in Canada as everywhere else in the world.\nThe 2030 Agenda is ambitious and aspirational. It acknowledges the requirement to move beyond conventional actions to seek transformative solutions.\nThe SDGs are interlinked and indivisible. The achievement of any goal is linked to the achievement of others.\nThe 2030 Agenda can only be achieved when no one is left behind ensuring that every person can participate in, contribute to and benefit from sustainable development.\n\nSustainable development is defined under the Federal Sustainable Development Act, the legislation that requires the government to prepare and report on the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy every three years.\n\nSustainable development not only ensures the planet's health for future generations, it also includes economic stability and vibrant, healthy communities.\nDefinitions\nsustainability\u2002means the capacity of a thing, action, activity, or process to be maintained indefinitely.\u2002(durabilit\u00e9)\n\nsustainable development\u2002means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u2002(d\u00e9veloppement durabilit\u00e9)\n\nChallenges being addressed\nFour years into the global implementation of the 2030 Agenda, progress has been made with many of the goals and targets. However, it is not proceeding at the pace needed to achieve this ambitious agenda.\n\nCanada is currently experiencing economic growth and historically low unemployment. with a rapidly evolving labour market due to globalization, new technologies, evolving business models and shifting demographics. Amid rapid change, Canada's prosperity and success will increasingly depend on helping all Canadians access decent jobs and on creating a culture of innovation, skills development and lifelong learning.\n\nThe spread of information and communications technology is helping to accelerate human progress. \nAdopting the 2030 Agenda\nCanadians are already answering the call. From businesses acting in socially responsible and environmentally sustainable ways, \u2026.overcome shared challenges and achieve the shared ambitions of the SDGs.\n\nIt is recommended that Canada\u2019s 2030 Agenda National Strategy cover the following:\nLeadership, governance and policy coherence\nworking across different levels of government to create an environment that fosters ownership and collaboration on the SDGs;\nAwareness, engagement and partnership\nraising awareness of the SDGs will include highlighting the efforts of Canadians who are already contributing to the 2030 Agenda\nCanada recognizes that multi-stakeholder partnerships are essential in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda. horizontal collaboration and innovation across sectors that help further implement the 2030 Agenda. This includes partnerships aimed at building awareness and engagement, expanding or establishing new partnerships and networks, and advancing capacity building and research. \nBringing together diverse experts with practical knowledge, experience and insights about approaches that work well enables Canada to enhance problem-solving, innovation and peer learning. These are important implementation tools that can generate new solutions to sustainable development challenges.\nAccountability, transparency and reporting\nReconciliation and the 2030 Agenda\nInvesting in the SDGs\nAchieving sustainable development is key to securing future economic prosperity, ensuring the health of the planet and preserving global peace and security.\nEnhance collaboration between different levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors and research communities, and support the development of new and innovative partnerships, approaches and breakthroughs to advance multiple SDGs.\n\nThe Federal Sustainable Development Strategy\nGoal 2:\nShort-term milestone: Promote and support the Canadian Agricultural Partnership Policy Framework\nConclude the Canadian Agricultural Partnership by 2023 and develop the next Canadian agricultural policy framework.\n\nImplementation strategy action: Support sustainable agriculture\nSupport research, development, knowledge transfer, and adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. Conduct research on the environmental effects of agriculture, as well as ways the sector can help combat climate change and become more economically and environmentally sustainable, including by developing nature-based agricultural climate solutions. Promote innovation and encourage the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, as well as the use of clean fuels and technologies at farm and landscape levels.\nGoal 8: \nTarget: Clean technology commercialization\nBetween 2022 and 2026, 30% of all Sustainable Development Technology Canada's SD Tech Fund-supported technologies are commercialized annually (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry)\nIndicator\nPercentage of SD Tech Fund-supported technologies commercialized (revenue derived from project technology)\nThis indicator tracks the percentage of SD Tech Fund supported technologies commercialized (revenue derived from project technology). As of March 31, 2021, 32% of Sustainable Development Technology Canada's supported technologies have been commercialized. Commercialized projects represent those that have entered or were ready to enter the market, as of March 31 of the given fiscal year.\nGoal 9:\nShort-term milestone: Growing business investment in research and development\nIncrease Canadian business expenditures in research and development to $30 billion by 2025, keeping pace with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average as a percentage of gross domestic product.\nGoal 12:\nShort-term milestone: Measure food loss and waste\nBy 2023, establish a national measurement framework and baseline to identify priority areas of action to reduce food loss and waste.\n\nImplementation strategy action: Deliver efficient food systems\nReduce food loss and waste at all stages of the food supply chain, helping to make our diverse food systems more efficient and more environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.\nGoal 13:\nShort-term milestone: Establish a 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan\nBy the end of March 2022, pursuant to the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, establish Canada's 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan that includes a description of the key measures the Government of Canada intends to take to achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 40 to 45% below 2005 levels."}]}

{"timestamp": 9870, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2021, "Output Length": 167, "prompt": "Summarize this \n\n[0041] Referring to FIG. 4, illustrated is a representative user interface (as represented by reference numeral 400) for creating a template from an existing contract document, in accordance with one or more exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. The user interface 400, as provided, may be implemented in the user device 300 as described. In an example, the user interface 400 provides an upload button 402a. A standard document that needs to be templatized is uploaded using the upload button 402a. In other example, an existing template (which may already be stored in a storage arrangement of the system 100) may be imported (via search or the like) to be edited via an edit template button 402b using the proposed framework. Herein, the template may be provided with a desired name using a template name box 404. Thereafter, the document is loaded in a document window 406. It may be appreciated that the contract documents even of the same type may have many fields that may vary from one contract to another, like party name, date of commencement, party address, purpose, jurisdiction, term etc., and thus need to be identified to create a template for the said contract document type. \n[0042] In one embodiment, the fields to be created may be identified in the contact document by manual selection on the loaded document in the document window 406. In such case, a name of each of the manually identified fields is assigned in a fields window 408. Once the fields are created, those may be highlighted in the document. The present user interface 400 with the available fields window 408 may allow to perform the described manual process of identifying fields, which may ultimately be used for creating contract document template, in a user-friendly and intuitive manner, which is not the case with conventionally known contract templatization software and services. \n[0043] In a preferred embodiment, the fields to be created may be identified in the contract document by automatic identification using a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm is based on an NER (named entity recognition) technique. Herein, the user interface 400 may be configured to allow a user to define one or more entities from the displayed text of the contract document in the document window 406; and train a suitable machine learning model to determine entities complementary to the defined entity in the contract document. Specifically, an NER based algorithm is used to extract the entities for the uploaded documents. Some of the entities of interest may include: party1, party2, effective date which are available in the party clause of a contract, contract type, which may, for example, be available in the heading of the document and the term/termination clause of the contract document. \n[0044] In an example, separate models may be created to identify each or a group of these entities by training the corresponding NER models. The NER algorithm is trained by using data with entities in an IOB form (short for inside, outside, beginning), extracted from various documents. The machine learning model may be trained using a variety of models. The process can be iterated multiple times till a desired level of accuracy is achieved. Once the models are trained, tag extraction is carried out on relevant clauses using the inference pipeline. The users can extract information of their interest using this framework. This is an intuitive and quick way for users to be able to extract custom information from text data.\n[0045] Referring to FIG. 5, illustrated is a schematic of a modelling pipeline (as represented by reference numeral 500) for generating an NER model, as per embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown, at step 502, the modelling pipeline 500 involves using a training corpus of various contract documents types (as identified). In the present examples, the training corpus dataset may need a large number of documents, typically more than 600 per entity, in order to deal with data imbalance. At step 504, the modelling pipeline 500 involves using an annotation tool, such as Prodigy, Inception, Docanno, Brat, etc., to come up with IOB labels (which are a format for chunks, and are similar to part-of-speech tags but can denote the inside, outside, and beginning of a chunk) for the used training corpus. At step 506, the modelling pipeline 500 involves generating the NER model using the annotated training corpus by implementing machine learning techniques including, but not limited to, CRFs (conditional random fields), BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM), CNN, ElMo (Embeddings from Language Model), Stanford NLP, or other transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT3), etc., without any limitations. \n[0046] Further, referring to FIG. 6, illustrated is a schematic of an inference pipeline (as represented by reference numeral 600) for implementing the generated NER model (as described in reference to the modelling pipeline 500 of FIG. 5) for entities identification in the contract document being processed (as in the document window 406). Herein, the inference pipeline 600 involves inputting extracted clauses from the contract documents, as may be achieved by a clause classification/extraction model (not described herein for brevity of the present disclosure). The inference pipeline 600 further involves implementing the NER model as described for recognizing entities in the text (as being represented by block 604 in FIG. 6). In the present implementation, the text is pre-processed as per the requirement of the NER model. Herein, an output of the inference pipeline 600 is in the form of extracted entity details from the contract document being processed (as being represented by block 606 in FIG. 6). As may be appreciated, the entity details may include information like parties, term, jurisdiction, effective date, type of the contract document, etc.\n[0047] Subsequently, the identified entities may be defined as fields for the contract document type. As may be understood that each of the identified entities (which may be converted into fields) may have associated properties (field type), like \u201cdate\u201d for effective date, \u201ctext\u201d for party name, \u201cinteger\u201d for amount, etc. Such properties for the various identified entities may be automatically determined, and the corresponding field types may be set as such. Herein, for instance, the properties of the fields (i.e., field types) may be set as of different types like integer, float, date, text, etc. Further, properties of the fields may be set as a dropdown (for standard lists like jurisdictions, country names, etc.), calendar (for dates), etc. All of this may be done in the fields window 408, as previously described in reference to FIG. 4. In the present embodiments, the user interface 400 may be configured to allow for the field types (as created) to be edited, deleted, or modified, if required.\n[0048] Also, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the user interface 400 provides one or more signature and stamp pads boxes 410a, 410b which may allow inserting signatures/stamps in the document at a desired location. Further, the user interface 400 may be configured to allow the insertion of signatures on certain page(s) or all the pages (as required) of the contract document by use of an insert signature button 412. Also, the user interface 400 may be configured to allow the insertion of signatures on certain page(s) or all the pages (as required) of the contract document by use of an insert stamp pad button 414. In some examples, the user interface 400 may also provide a photograph button 416 which can be added and configured as a photo capture field. The user interface 400 may also allow to define a workflow by identifying various steps involved, setting names/emails of people the document flows to, notifications that need to be sent out, etc. by providing a configure workflow button 418. In some examples, the contract document can be set up to include webhooks to manage how a document is created and be shared with other applications, like a contract documents datastore of a same enterprise.\n[0049] It may be appreciated that in all of the above described processes, the clauses in the contact document being processed can be dragged and dropped, re-arranged as required in the document window 406 by the user. Further, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the user interface 400 may allow saving templates (as generated so far) by providing a save template button 420. It may be understood that when the save template button 420 is pushed, the fields identified in the contract document being processed are replaced by an identifiable string in the backend (for example, a party field may be replaced with a string like \u201c#@#Party1#@#\u201d). Now, the created (saved) contract document may be used as a template for generating other contract documents of the same types, as discussed in the proceeding paragraphs. In some examples, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the user interface 400 may further allow users to download a copy of the created contract document template, for reference and perusal of the user, by providing a download template button 422."}]}

And that\u2019s where I think that contextualization is what made those appeals successful, rather than just saying, hey, it\u2019s a pandemic you should give to our orchestra. It\u2019s like, wait, why, do you mean? Go that level deeper and really tug on those heartstrings and unlock what it is those people have always kind of cared about you. But yeah, I can\u2019t think of another cause that matters more in darker times than those performing arts folks. So my heart goes out to them. And I hope that so many of them will be able to stick around because we need you.\n\n[00:15:19.980] \u2013 Boris\nAbsolutely. I\u2019m a fan, of course, of the arts. But on Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, the arts might not be at the bottom, but they\u2019re on there. They\u2019re self actualization and they are education. They are force for good. I don\u2019t have to sell people, especially those folks in the arts. But I found it honestly a little disheartening how a lot of arts organizations felt about themselves and their work.\n\n[00:15:47.790] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nThat\u2019s the thing.\n\n[00:15:49.150] \u2013 Boris\nThey didn\u2019t know how to speak to their existing base and to try to grow their base during this time of upheaval.\n\n[00:15:58.530] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nThat\u2019s the heartbreaking thing for me. You mentioned the webinar series. We were doing a webinar, probably March or April 2020. One of the attendees chatted in like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just a library foundation. We\u2019re not saving lives.\u201d And I kind of grabbed the microphone from my guest and I said, \u201cNo, my gosh, people need the arts.\u201d They need books, right? I told the story of my kids. We love to go to the library every Saturday morning. It\u2019s one of their favorite activities. We want that to be there when we can finally get back out of the house in a safe way. That\u2019s the situation we find ourselves back in. So that to me is, don\u2019t sell yourself short, right? Because there will be another crisis, like you said, Boris, and you will not only matter, but you may even be more critical, especially to the people that already care and hold that cause near and dear to your heart. So I hope people find this encouraging. That\u2019s kind of how I think you mean it, too. And I definitely mean it because there will be something else that happens.\n\n[00:17:00.710] \u2013 Boris\nSo we teased since the beginning of the episode, we teased that we\u2019ve got data that we\u2019ve got data on what\u2019s going on, what was working, what wasn\u2019t working. And I personally want to hear it because I haven\u2019t gotten it yet. And I\u2019ve read some of the reports out there. But talk to me, Steven. What happened during the pandemic, what\u2019s going on now and what\u2019s not working?\n\n[00:17:24.940] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nWell, aside from asking and not putting ourselves on the sidelines, that was definitely a big one. But we also looked at those folks that were doing well and maybe even doing better than in past years. A couple of things stood out. The prevalence of phone calls. So we\u2019re a donor database so we can see what kind of interactions people are making with their donors and in what format. And we saw phone calls not only shoot up, probably because we couldn\u2019t do events and maybe even direct mail was harder, but not only were more phone calls being made to supporters, but we could really see that they were moving the needle on things like revenue and donor retention and things like that.\n\n[00:18:09.700] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAnd I think it\u2019s because especially in 2020, we were isolated. We were social distanced. That phone call from a nonprofit to a supporter, that may have been one of the only few personal interactions that they encountered and probably the only one from a brand, right? From someone who wasn\u2019t a friend or a family member or a co-worker. That not only made a big difference in 2020, but again, it continued to have efficacy through 2021. And I think for all the reasons I just said, but also because it\u2019s so surprising to get a phone call that\u2019s a pure thank you or is showing curiosity about why you support. And I sound kind of cynical and I hate to be surprised, but that\u2019s kind of rare, right? I can count on maybe one hand how many times that\u2019s happened to me from a nonprofit or anything that I\u2019ve supported.\n\n[00:19:04.490] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nPersonal emails, same thing. So there\u2019s mass emails where you set up an email blast to all the people in your database, all 2000 of them or whatever. We also saw people reaching out individually, you know, me literally opening up Gmail, writing an email to Boris, like, \u201cHey, Boris, thanks for having me on the show. You\u2019re awesome. Let\u2019s stay in touch.\u201d The same thing not only increased, but also did have an effect on that year over year kind of revenue increases. So the last two years were this kind of re-emergence, at least from our view, of truly personal outreach. And again, what better time? And maybe that\u2019s what spurred it on, because we couldn\u2019t do things like events or in-person interactions or things like that. So that was the only alternative. But I think it opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes to like, wow, maybe we should make this a normal thing that we do during any kind of climate or crisis, if there is one, because people give to people, right? And fundraising is very relationship driven, you know, this.\n\n[00:20:10.550] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nBut I feel like because of all this technology available to us, maybe those kind of analog or one to one or old school formats or mediums have kind of gone by the wayside but did come back because of pure necessity, right? Because that\u2019s all there was out there. And I hope that that sticks around because there\u2019s always been evidence that those things are impactful. But we really saw those things be even more impactful over the last two years. So another thing that I\u2019ve been shouting from the rooftop: reach out to people, because it is very personal.\n\n[00:20:45.410] \u2013 Boris\nSo there was a lot of great stuff in there that I want to touch on and really highlight. And I\u2019m really glad that you said people give to people because earlier you had said nonprofits reaching out to individuals. It\u2019s not nonprofits that are on the phone. You\u2019re a person at your nonprofit. And you said how many brands do that. I don\u2019t remember any time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m wearing a Banana Republic sweater; Banana Republic has never called me and asked, \u201cHey, Boris, how are you doing with this pandemic or with this crisis in Ukraine?\n\n[00:21:19.560] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nRight. It would be weird.\n\n[00:21:21.260] \u2013 Boris\nYeah, exactly. It would be weird. It might be interesting, but they don\u2019t care. They care. \u201cHey, Boris, here\u2019s a coupon, maybe come back and spend some more money.\u201d\n\n[00:21:30.560] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nGet the matching tie.\n\n[00:21:31.940] \u2013 Boris\nYeah, exactly.\n\n[00:21:33.240] \u2013 Boris\nWhereas a nonprofit does care, hopefully does care about its constituents, about its supporters, certainly about its clients, has things to say and has questions to ask. You\u2019ve got to ask, you\u2019ve got to be curious. Not just, \u201cHey, why do you support us,\u201d but also \u201chow are you doing?\u201d Reinforce that connection.\n\n[00:21:53.100] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAnd I would imagine that was the question behind a lot of that outreach, either by phone or by email. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, Boris, you\u2019re a monthly donor. We want to say thanks, but also wanted to say, are you okay? This is a tough time. We just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d And you\u2019re right. Like buying a shirt is not personal, but donating to a cancer charity because your grandmother passed away from that form of cancer, that\u2019s very personal. So to be able to reach back out, acknowledge it, yeah, but learn that information. I love the word you used, showing curiosity. I think that\u2019s something that we definitely suffer from as a fundraising sector is, why do these people support us? And there is most often than not a story behind that, maybe not as much as during times of crisis where you\u2019re kind of driven by that urgent need and not necessarily care about that cause. And I know you and Tim talked about that, and that kind of giving definitely does happen. But a lot of the gifts, there\u2019s probably a very personal reason behind it. If that can be the conversation starter, that\u2019s a pretty darn powerful conversation.\n\n[00:23:02.030] \u2013 Boris\nSo I do want to ask, though, you mentioned in your CRM you might have 2000 folks on your list. I don\u2019t know which organization has the bandwidth to personally call 2000 people. How do you navigate that? It seems almost cold to prioritize certain people over others. Is there a strategy that you recommend that you\u2019ve seen work or think is a good way to go?\n\n[00:23:28.410] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nYeah, I\u2019m glad you asked, because it\u2019s hard. And there\u2019s tons of people like me who are saying, like, you\u2019re not doing enough, and here are 20 things you should be doing. And I get it. It\u2019s hard. And if you\u2019ve got that big data set, I think there are a couple of low hanging fruit. I mentioned first-time donors. That\u2019s one where we have the data and we\u2019ll share and we can link it in the show notes, I suppose. But the phone calls really work. They really do seem to have an effect on not just retention rates, but the speed in which you received a second gift. That window really shortens if they\u2019ve been called and they tend to give more. And I think it comes down again to curiosity, right? So you call them. \u201cHey, Boris, thanks so much for your first gift. Happy to have you join our community of donors. By the way, why did you give? What spurred that gift today?\u201d And if you can learn or get that story, that will help you subsequently communicate to them, right? And sort of contextualize that reason for giving.\n\n[00:24:30.620] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nSo I love first-time donors as a priority. If you get a phone number, and you\u2019re not always going to have a phone number and I don\u2019t recommend you go out and try to find their phone number, like call their employer, that would be a little weird. But if you got a first-time gift and they gave you a phone number, if maybe it was not required on the form or they offered it up somehow, that\u2019s almost an invitation. So that\u2019s probably going to take that list of 2000 down to under ten because it may not happen very often. And maybe that\u2019s doable in an hour or so on a Friday afternoon, call those people, say thanks, welcome them, maybe find out a little bit about that motivation. Monthly donors, that\u2019s one that maybe flies a little under the radar because it\u2019s happening automatically. Maybe the dollar amounts are small; $5 a month doesn\u2019t seem like that much. Although over the lifetime, that\u2019s a pretty significant lifetime value. \u201cHey, Boris, thanks for being a monthly donor. You\u2019re keeping the lights on. Just want to say thanks, check in with you, make sure you\u2019re doing okay. How\u2019s the family?\u201d Whatever it is, that kind of outreach.\n\n[00:25:37.550] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nWhat are those segments? Get out the whiteboard and write down like, who are those people? First-time donors, monthly donors, lapsed donors. People who have been giving for a long time. Everybody will probably have those. But depending on your cause type, volunteers, alumni, former service recipients, people who have adopted animals from us, who are those types of people? And then you can kind of decide, okay, what do we want to say to these people? Can we automate some of these things? Should we ask for different things from these people? Go through that exercise and identify it."}]}

The assignment will cover socket programming. You will use C or C++\nto implement it although C is recommended.\nBefore starting the implementation, please read Section 3.4 \u2013 Principles of Reliable Data Transfer from Kurose & Ross to cover the theory. For the practice, you can read Beej\u2019s Guide to Network\nProgramming (Using Internet Sockets). Finally, to understand the big picture regarding the reliable data transfer, you can check out the interactive material on the Kurose & Ross website and\nthis animation.\nYou can discuss the homework and ask your questions on the discussion forum thread on our\nODTUClass page. I am also available at yigit@ceng.metu.edu.tr.\n2 Setup\nPlease follow the instructions given in this section thoroughly to set up your homework environment.\nWe will use an Ubuntu Vagrant box as the host machine and create two network containers in\nit. By adjusting the parameters of the interfaces (at both ends) between the client and the server,\nwe will have a seamless and native unreliable channel without relying on any external programs.\nRun the following commands on an empty folder. If you follow along, you can code on your\nhost machine which is synced with the Vagrant box, so you can compile and run your client and\nserver on there.\n(host) vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64 # create a new ubuntu 22.04 box\n# Places a Vagrantfile on the empty directory\n# We will develop alongside it\n(host) mkdir code\nNow we have a directory with a Vagrantfile and the code directory inside. We can edit the\nVagrantfile to have the code directory synced inside the Vagrant box.\n1\n# -\\*- mode: ruby -\\*-\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\n# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The \"2\" in Vagrant.configure\n# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for\n# backwards compatibility).

If you are curious about\nthe process please refer to that tutorial, but understanding it is not necessary to complete this\nhomework.\nYou can also follow the steps on this screencast to see what should be happening at each step.\nAt the end of the screencast I demonstrate the nc binary as a makeshift server-client chat program.\nYour binaries will have a similar behavior.\nYou should run your client binary at the client container and the server binary at the server\ncontainer.\n2.1 Manipulating Traffic\nAll this setup for containers would be quite pointless sans this step. Here, we will write netem\n(Network Emulator) rules using tc to make the connection between the server and the client a lot\nworse. This section was prepared according to the lab manual from Jed Crandall\u2019s course. You\ncan refer to that document for a complete picture.\nThe following tc/netem rules are the worst case you will have to deal with. You should run\nthe rules twice inside each container, one for each interface.\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 50ms loss 25% 10% duplicate 25% reorder 25% 50%\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 50ms loss 25% 10% duplicate 25% reorder 25% 50%\nWhile developing, you might want to start with a good channel between the client and the\nserver, and degrade it as you complete the requirements. If you would like to follow that route,\nyou should first start with;\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 10ms\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 10ms\nAnd then change the tc rules gradually.\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface, note the change rather than add\ntc qdisc change dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 10ms loss 20%\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc change dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 10ms loss 20%\nThe following are useful as well;\n# see the current rules in effect\ntc qdisc show\n# deleting a rule using change is cumbersome\n# delete alltogether and start from scratch\n# mind the interface\ntc qdisc del dev ceth0 root\n3\n3 Implementation\nWe are implementing a chat scenario on the command line. Your implementation will output two\nbinaries: a client and a server. The client and the server will only talk to each other, and there\nwill be two participants in the chat. The messages will end with a newline character, so every\nmessage is a single line. A client-server architecture is ideal for this task. However, there are some\nconstraints.\nThe network we are on is particularly bad, the packets might be reordered, dropped, delayed\nor even duplicated. As an additional constraint, the payload of any packet you send can have at\nmost 16 bytes. This does include the sequence number or any other metadata you might use to\ndeliver the packet.\nThe scenario would have been trivial if we were allowed to use SOCK STREAM \u2013 kernel\u2019s TCP\nimplementation. It would take care of the reliable transfer for us. However, we are only allowed to\nuse SOCK DGRAM, to send packets using UDP. You can read more at $ man 2 socket on any Linux\nmachine.\nYou are recommended to start with the interface given in the Section 3.4 of the Kurose & Ross\nbook. We are going to implement the Go-Back-N protocol, described in the textbook.\nTo ensure reliable transfer on the unreliable channel, you need to implement ACK packets to\nmake sure the other side got your packet right, and a timer mechanism for every packet you sent\nso that lost packets can trigger a timeout.\nThe server starts listening on a socket and the client initiates the connection. Then, both\nprograms accept user input from the standard input and send the message to the other side. Any\ninput (on both server and client) will be sent to the other endpoint using reliable data transfer, on\nUDP packets. The receiving party should see the messages in the same order as they were written\nby the sending party, with duplicates silently ignored.\nIdeally, threading should be used to listen and send at the same time. This is especially\nimportant for receiving ACK packets and data packets concurrently, on both endpoints.\nTo terminate the connection, at any time but not as the first input/message, either server\u2019s\nuser or the client\u2019s user can enter three consecutive newline characters on stdin (two empty lines).\nThis will initiate the shutdown & teardown sequence for both the client and the server. Assume\nthe user sitting on the client input two empty lines. The client sends the shutdown request to\nthe server, still following the reliable transfer protocol. However, no more input from stdin will\nbe accepted (e.g. they will be ignored) nor any remaining messages from server will be displayed.\nWhen the server receives the shutdown request, it will also ignore the remaining messages in transit\nand ignore its stdin. When either endpoint complete the shutdown process (either through ACKs\nor sufficient timeouts), they can gracefully exit. The process mirrors for the server as well."}]}

Rather than\nincreasing demand for Merck\u2019s products, the company\u2019s\ninvestments are designed to support technologies that\ncould enhance its profitability by streamlining the way it\ndoes business. For example, Merck has invested in start-up\ncompanies developing ways to cut the time required to re-\ncruit appropriate patients for clinical trials of new drugs.\nMerck\u2019s relationship with the start-ups is that of an in-\nvestor and a customer. But if these ventures succeed,\nMerck will be able to use their methods to move its drugs\nmore rapidly through the clinical trials necessary to ob-\ntain FDA approval, leaving it more time to market a drug\nbefore its patent expires. The company estimates that\nspeeding up the patient recruitment process could ulti-\nmately add millions of dollars per month to Merck\u2019s bot-\ntom line. Again, Merck need not enjoy a high financial\nreturn on these investments to realize their strategic\nbenefits.\nBut enabling investments have their limits, too. These\nvehicles will be justified only if they can capture a sub-\nstantial portion of the market growth they stimulate.\nWhen Intel grows its ecosystem, it is also growing the mar-\nket for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices. Because\nIntel\u2019s market position is strong, it can expect to realize\nmost of the increased demand in the market. Intel\u2019s\nsmaller rival AMD, by contrast, could not afford to create\ndemand in a similar fashion because it would not capture\nenough of the increase to justify its investments.\nEmergent Investments. A company makes these\nkinds of investments in start-ups that have tight links to\nits operating capabilities but that offer little to enhance its\ncurrent strategy. Nevertheless, if the business environ-\nment shifts or if a company\u2019s strategy changes, such a new\nventure might suddenly become strategically valuable.\nThis gives it an optionlike strategic upside beyond what-\never financial returns it generates. For example, a com-\npany may sense an opportunity in a strategic \u201cwhite-\nspace\u201d \u2013 a new market with a new set of customers.\nExploring the potential of such a market is often difficult\nfor a company focused on serving its current market.\nInvesting in a start-up willing and able to enter this eal customers \u2013 provides information that\ncould never be gleaned from the hypothetical\nquestions of a market research survey. If the\nmarket seems to hold potential, the investing\ncompany may choose to shift its course.\nThus, while the immediate benefits, if any,\nof such investments are financial, the ultimate\nreturn may result from exercising the strategic\noption. In that sense, emergent investments\ncomplement the benefits of driving invest-\nments, which are designed only to further the\ncompany\u2019s current strategy.\nA strong operational link between a com-\npany and its start-up can take various forms.\nIt may mean sharing technology, as with the\nstart-ups spun off from Lucent Technologies.\n(See the sidebar \u201cLucent Hedges Its Bets.\u201d)\nLucent also sometimes shares production\nfacilities and sales channels with the newly\nindependent ventures, improving the effi-\nciency of its own production and distribution\noperations by allowing them to run at a\nhigher capacity.\nOr the links might take the form of product\nuse. In 1997, Intel invested in a start-up called\nBerkeley Networks. Berkeley used existing\nIntel processors to make low-cost switches\nand routers for communications networks \u2013\na new market for Intel products. At the time,\nIntel was happy to see its products used in this\nrather novel way. But with little likelihood\nthat Berkeley\u2019s business would create much\nincremental demand for its products and\nno other apparent strategic upside for itself,\nIntel saw the investment as primarily a finan-\ncial one.\nAs Intel performed its due diligence on its\ninvestment, though, it began to see the out-\nlines of a possible strategy shift, one that\nmight result in the widespread use of its products in net-\nwork switches. Initially, this view was controversial within\nthe company: At the time, Intel\u2019s communications busi-\nness was focused on making products (for example, net-\nwork interface cards for PC networks) that were compat-\nible with the prevailing Ethernet network standard. Since\nthe Berkeley approach competed with the Ethernet stan-\ndard, Intel had to balance the benefits of promoting a\nnew network architecture that used Intel\u2019s core Pentium\nproducts against the threat that the Berkeley-inspired ar-\nchitecture posed to Ethernet networks. After some sharp\ninternal disagreements \u2013 and after the value of Berkeley\nNetworks began to grow \u2013 Intel decided to adapt its strat-\negy to pursue this opportunity, culminating in the Intel\nInternet Exchange Architecture, launched in 1999. The investment in Berkeley Networks helped Intel identify a\npromising opportunity more quickly than it might have\notherwise.\nOf course, many options never become valuable, and\nmany emergent investments will never be important\nto an organization\u2019s strategy. It is important to let these\noptions lapse and settle for whatever financial returns\nhave been earned. Thus, managing these investments\nrequires balancing financial discipline with strategic\npotential. Many companies err by throwing good money\nafter bad. Partnering with private VC funds, and follow-\ning their lead, is one way to impose financial discipline\non the process.\nPassive Investments. In this mode of VC investment,\nthe ventures are not connected to the corporation\u2019s own\nstrategy and are only loosely linked to the corporation\u2019s\noperational capabilities. Consequently, the corporation\nlacks the means to actively advance its own business\nthrough these investments. And despite the perception of\nsome companies that they enjoy technology or market\nknowledge that gives them advantages over other in-\nvestors, the recent flight of corporate VC suggests other-\nwise. Thus, in passive venturing, a corporation is just an-\nother investor subject to the vagaries of financial returns\nin the private equity market. Indeed, this type of investing\nis arguably a misuse of shareholders\u2019 funds. (For a fuller\ndiscussion, see the sidebar \u201cThe Corporation as Money\nManager.\u201d)\nFor example, Dell Ventures poured money into ven-\ntures that had only tangential connections with Dell\u2019s\nown strategy. Yes, these ventures would have increased\ndemand for personal computers and servers if they had\nsucceeded, but Dell\u2019s market share was not high enough\nto allow it to capture much of the gain from that in-\ncreased demand. When the value of its investments col-\nlapsed last year, no potential strategic benefit remained \u2013\nas would have been the case with an emergent invest-\nment \u2013 to compensate for the financial losses."}]}
{"timestamp": 9956, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3166, "Output Length": 86, "prompt": "Part 4 (acknowledge and await part 5 and any other parts):\n\nTrenton (Trenton Journal)\n\nThe second community for which we assessed information needs was Trenton. The survey was distributed by Miles, owner of The Trenton Journal, to people in his network, including the nonprofit community foundation for which he also works, as well as prominent churches. Miles also posted a link to the survey in his newsletter and on his website. As in Paterson, we also created a printed flyer with the survey link and a QR code. Because of the financial incentive, we had a number of false responses by bots or people trying to game the drawing, which we also saw in Paterson. The final N, after cleaning, was 119 (recall that all questions were optional, so the numbers reported below often do not add up to 119).\n\nThe survey respondents were distributed evenly among the four wards of Trenton; this suggests that Trenton Journal\u2019s coverage of the four wards should be roughly equal. \n\nTable 1: Where survey respondents live\nEast Ward \nNorth Ward\nSouth Ward\nWest Ward\n21\n25\n23\n22\nThe graphic below shows how long the respondents have lived in Trenton. There is marked variation here depending on the ward; in the West, South and North wards, more than 65% of residents have lived there for at least six years, while in the south ward more than 55% of residents have been there for at least 11 years, showing depth of connection to the community. The East ward is the most evenly distributed and has the greatest percentage of residents who have been there for less than a year; notably, all of the respondents from the North ward have lived there for at least a year. The focus group respondents also tended to be people who have lived in the city for a decade or longer (we did not differentiate their answers by ward).\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nIn general, the respondents who live in Trenton\u2019s South Ward stood out as having different experiences and opinions in many cases, compared to residents of other wards. Perhaps surprisingly, given how long people have lived in the area, they were much more likely to say their community is a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d place to live (43%). For comparison, only 23% of the East Ward, 19% of the West Ward, and 20% of the North Ward residents said the same (see graphic below). Because of this and other marked differences, the responses of South Ward residents were considered separately for the analysis.\n\nRespondents from the West ward were generally happiest with their community\u2019s quality of life, with more than half stating that Trenton is a good or excellent place to live, followed by respondents from the East and North wards, where roughly half think the same. By contrast, nearly half of respondents from the South ward said Trenton is a poor or terrible place to live, and the fewest calling it a fair place to live, showing the strongest division of opinion on the question. \n\nWe asked people to describe the community in one sentence. Some of the responses were negative:\n\nThere are a lot of empty houses in my neighborhood.\nLack of police presence.\nLots of crime and gangs.\n\nBut others struck a balanced and nuanced view of the strengths and challenges:\nEclectic mix of good and bad.\nTrenton should be so much nicer than it is, but it is well located and there is lots in the surrounding area that is wonderful.\nA good community where good people and good news is lost in the bad press and violence by a few in the community.\nYou can see the beauty within the struggle.\nIt depends where you live in the community.\n\nPeople in both focus groups acknowledged problems with the area \u2013 lack of repairs to facilities and problems accessing public information came up several times \u2013 but also emphasized the many positive sides of Trenton and of the people who live there. They wanted to hear more about these positive stories and have easier access to public information to fix the things that are wrong; these comments informed the recommendations that we made to the publisher (listed below).\n\nWhat are Trenton\u2019s information needs?\n\nAbout 6 in 10 survey respondents said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to keep up with local news. Meanwhile, 40% said it is harder today to keep up with local news compared to three years ago. Only 23% said it was easier. The focus group participants reported following news at the national, state and local levels, usually through mass media such as cable news networks or the evening news. Both survey and focus group participants said they would be excited about a local news source that filled the existing information gaps in Trenton. \n\nSatisfaction/concern\n\nOne survey question asked whether each topic is a significant source of either satisfaction or concern in the community. On many topics, the respondents from Trenton disagreed. The most polarizing issue was crime and safety: 33% feel crime is high and they are unsafe there, while 46% of people think the opposite. \n\nThere were four topics where at least 15% of the people strongly agreed but another at least 15% strongly disagreed:\nCrime is low/high.\nEntertainment options are good/bad.\nJobs are satisfactory/unsatisfactory.\nThe environment is clean/unclean.\n\nAdditionally, local government and politics was the issue most people had an opinion about. Only 10% said this was not important to them. Fifty percent agreed that local officials are effective and trustworthy, while 33% disagreed. The responses to these topic-based questions suggested to us that the Journal will want to be even-handed in its coverage, especially of these divisive local topics.\n\nSome topics, however, evoked agreement:\nThe community\u2019s history. A total of 32% strongly agreed and 60% at least somewhat agreed that Trenton has history and traditions to be proud of.\nSports. A total of 58% agreed that local sports are fun and exciting to follow, while only 21% disagreed.\nSocial issues. A total of 56% agreed that the community shares their values on issues like race, immigration, and abortion.\n\nAnother survey question asked, \u201cHow important is it for you personally to read the following types of information in the Trenton Journal?\u201d\n\nRespondents said the most important topics of coverage were crime, sports, health care, and local government. There were large groups who were \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in other topics: entertainment options, local history and traditions, and local arts and culture. Twenty-six percent said that family life is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them.\nHow people use and access local news\n\nTo better understand The Trenton Journal community\u2019s information needs and the motivations that drive them to seek out local news, we asked them to name the most important reasons they follow local news. The top response was \u201cto stay informed and be a better citizen\u201d (37%). \n\nAfter that nearly a third of respondents said they use local news for entertainment, hobbies, and sports (33%), or to \u201cfind places to go and things to do\u201d (30%). Twenty-eight percent said local news helped them in their job and 26% said it helped them stay safe and avoid crime. These answers point to the importance of \u201cservice journalism,\u201d a simple but extremely practical and helpful practice.\n\nThere were a few most-common ways that survey respondents discover local news in Trenton. Each of these is used every day by 3 in 10 survey respondents, and at least weekly by 50 to 60% of them:\nFrom friends / family.\nGoogle searches.\nReading Facebook News Feed.\nReading Facebook Groups.\n\nFacebook is a major factor in the local news ecosystem of the survey respondents. Nearly 8 in 10 are getting local news and information there regularly. Half use Facebook for news at least once a week. Notably, the everyday news engagement is slightly stronger for Facebook Groups than for Facebook News Feed.\n\nFrequency of use for news\nFacebook News Feed\nFacebook Group\nEvery day\n23%\n28%\nWeekly or more\n55%\n51%\nA few times a month or more\n78%\n67%\nSeparately, we asked people how satisfied they are with various local news sources, including some Facebook Groups. The Facebook Groups ranked higher in satisfaction than any other news source. For example the Group named \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d rated highly, with 25% saying they \u201clove it and use it all the time\u201d and a total of 60% saying they at least \u201cfind it useful and use it sometimes.\u201d Another 18% \u201cdon\u2019t love it, but \u201cuse it when I have to.\u201d Only 10% avoid it and 12% never heard of or used it. The Group named \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton\u201d was more polarizing: 28% \u201clove it\u201d and 16% \u201cdislike\u201d it. Nonetheless, 50% of respondents find it useful sometimes and 65% at least use it when they have to. Focus group participants also reported accessing local news via Facebook, as well as from family/friends and from local television news, in particular on News 12 New Jersey.\n\nOther social networks are used by a smaller number of respondents, suggesting either that the Journal should be cautious about devoting too many scarce resources to other platforms or that the survey and focus groups did not reach community members who use these for local news and information.\n\nSocial network\nPercent using daily\nPercent using 1-2 times a week or more\nInstagram\n19%\n43%\nTwitter\n12%\n37%\nTikTok\n14%\n31%\n\nMeanwhile, about 45% of survey respondents use Trenton Journal social media accounts at least weekly, and 68% visit at least a few times a month. The other newspapers we asked about \u2014 The Trentonian, Trenton Daily, and The Times of Trenton \u2014 ranked lower in satisfaction; these may be secondary sources for some of the Journal\u2019s readers.\nWe also asked survey respondents to name any sources that they \u201ctrust the most for useful, reliable local news and information.\u201d There were a few individual responses to that question that might suggest nontraditional sources with whom the Journal may want to build relationships:\nLuz Esperanza y Vida organization.\nEast Trenton committee.\nTrenton Waves podcast.\nStreet ministries.\nThe Old Mill Hill Society.\n\nWhat people think of Trenton Journal\n\nRespondents generally enjoy Trenton Journal\u2019s content on social media: 21% \u201clove\u201d Trenton Journal social media and use it all the time. Another 41% (the most common answer) say Trenton Journal\u2019s social media is \u201cuseful and use it sometimes.\u201d Only 12% dislike its social accounts, and 12% haven\u2019t heard of them yet. Opinions were stronger among residents of the South Ward. They have a more favorable opinion of Trent Journal\u2019s social media accounts (32% \u201clove it\u201d, another 45% say \u201cuseful sometimes\u201d), and they rated Trenton Journal\u2019s social media accounts as more satisfying than any other local news source. \n\nTrenton Journal\u2019s website and emails were a bit less popular than their social media; still, a majority do find them useful. The website or emails are used by 47% at least weekly and at least 61% visit at least a few times a month. These somewhat contradictory findings should be explored in follow-up conversations with community members or further research.\n\nReader opinion\nTrenton Journal\u2019s \nsocial media accounts\nTrenton Journal\u2019s\n website and emails\n\u201cLove it, use it all the time\u201d\n21%\n19%\n\u201cI find it useful and use it sometimes\u201d\n41%\n39%\n\u201cI dislike it and avoid using it\u201d\n12%\n18%\nNever heard or it or used it\n12%\n9%\n\nWe asked the people familiar with Trenton Journal how well it does certain things. At least 60% of people think it does these things at least \u201cfairly well\u201d:\nIs fair to all sides.\nIs neutral and doesn't take positions on issues.\nActs as a watchdog of powerful institutions and people.\nMakes the news entertaining.\nProvides diverse points of view.\nMakes it easier to find important civic information.\nHelps people understand communities unlike their own.\nVerifies and gets the facts right.\n\nSlightly fewer people, about 55%, think it does these things at least fairly well:\nProvides forums for community discussions,\nReports on possible solutions to problems in society,\n\nAt the same time, a sizeable minority (about 40% of people) thought the Trenton Journal did those things poorly, so there is room to improve. \n\nAs part of the research design, we devised several recommendations for each publisher based on analysis of the data from the survey and focus groups. The recommendations we presented to the Trenton Journal are below, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\n\nRecommendations given to the Trenton Journal\n\nCreate a dedicated section for posting the dates and times of upcoming municipal meetings, similar to your events page; publicize it via your newsletter and social media.\nGo one step further and cover municipal meetings regularly, even if it\u2019s simply by providing a transcript.\nConsider adding a section on your website that lists all city and state departments, the services they provide, and their contact information.\nConsider offering different sub-pages for each ward, that can be tailored to the differing concerns and interest in each.\nEngage to a greater extent on Facebook, and be present on Facebook groups that are relevant in Trenton, especially \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d and \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton.\u201d\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, Trenton Journal decided to make the following changes:\n\nIncrease coverage of municipal meetings, the education system, and crime and safety.\n\nCreate a tab on the website\u2019s resource page to house publicly available data about the city.\n\nCreate an online directory of public officials and other power-holders in the city; increase coverage of them through profiles and interviews.\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them how often they visited Trenton Journal\u2019s website, how they felt about each of these changes, and for any other open-ended feedback they might provide. For each of the changes, we asked whether they agreed or disagreed with this change, and if they disagreed, what they\u2019d like to see done instead. Again the sample was disappointingly small (N=9), but generally positive.\n\nFour of the nine reported visiting the website daily, while three said they visit a few times a week and one said rarely. Perhaps not surprisingly (since the changes were based on community feedback), there was overwhelming agreement with the changes that Trenton Journal is making. However when there was disagreement there was valuable feedback, such as the suggestion to focus on neighborhoods rather than the education system, or to provide data about the percentage of rentals to ownership and information about rental building ownership as part of the publicly available data. One open-ended response stated, \u201cI love the idea of covering municipal government and the people that are associated with it.\u201d"}]}

Nate used to be a child who was forced to live inside the town of Oak Ridge ( this town belonged to Mr. Gray's pseudo-christian religious cult called \"The Church of True Dawn of our lord Jesus Christ\" or just \"the Dawn\" ). Ethan escaped this cult in 1995. and Nate essentially escaped a year later. Ethan and Nate discovered that the cult is a part of an evil organization controlled by Mr. Gray. \n\nNate was able to use his prescience to strike a few blows against this cult and Mr. Gray, but as Raziel became operational ( and growingly more powerful ), Nate was only able to cancel-out Raziel's plans - but Raziel was also able to cancel-out Nate's plans, due to them both being prescient and in a conflict.\nThe dynamic between Nate, Raziel, and Mr. Gray adds a fascinating aspect to your story. Here are some suggestions for how to incorporate their complex relationship and their abilities in your novel:\n\nIn the second novel, as Nate is physically and mentally connected to Tiamat, you could explore how his prescient abilities have changed or developed over time. This could create new challenges for Lena and her companions as they try to navigate the consequences of Nate's actions from the past and the present.\n\nThe rivalry between Nate and Raziel can be a significant plot point in the story. As both are prescient and have been countering each other's moves, you could create a tense game of cat-and-mouse between the two. Lena and her allies may need to find a way to exploit this rivalry to their advantage or figure out how to break the stalemate between Nate and Raziel.\n\nYou could delve into the history of Nate and Ethan's time in Oak Ridge and their escape from the cult. This backstory can provide valuable context for the characters' motivations and relationships with Mr. Gray and the Dawn. It could also serve as a source of unresolved conflicts or tensions that resurface throughout the novel.\n\nAs Mr. Gray is aware of both Nate's and Raziel's abilities, he might attempt to manipulate them to his own advantage, playing them against each other or trying to control their actions. This could lead to unexpected twists and betrayals as the characters try to outmaneuver one another.\n\nThe prescient abilities of Nate and Raziel could also create opportunities for interesting narrative structures and storytelling techniques. For example, you could have chapters or scenes that take place in the past, present, or future, showing the consequences of their actions and how they impact the world around them. This nonlinear storytelling can keep readers engaged and guessing about what will happen next.\n\nBy developing the complex relationships and abilities of Nate, Raziel, and Mr. Gray, you can create a rich and engaging narrative that will captivate readers and leave them eager for more. Their intertwined histories and the ongoing battle between prescient characters add depth and tension to the story, making for a thrilling read.\n\n\nPetar B\n1. In the last few chapters of the previous novel, Nate is wounded and laid on Tiamat's side, so he is unable to communicate with the outside world. Tiamat is also unable to communicate with anyone else except Nate, so they exist and influence the world in this novel, but they are kind of separate from the rest of the world and the other characters. \n\n2. The rivalry between Raziel and Nate was a plot point in the previous novel, now Raziel is slowly losing his mind because of the radiation, and he's dissatisfied because he must serve the Hybrids. Raziel sees Mr. Gray as his primary master, but he is programmed to be loyal to the hybrids.\n\n3. this is all covered in the first novel. Some might appear as some memories, but whoever wants to know more, can just grab the first novel and read it.\n\n4. Mr. Gray isn't fully aware of Nate's powers, and neither is Raziel. They sense that Nate has something to do with problems in their previous plans, and they sense that Nate might have had something to do with Mr. Gray's downfall from power, but they are not sure, and neither is Lena.\n\nThank you for the clarification. Given these points, here are some suggestions for your second novel:\n\nThroughout the second novel, you can provide glimpses of Nate and Tiamat's conversations or experiences while they remain separate from the rest of the world. This can add an air of mystery and intrigue, as readers try to understand the true nature of their connection and how it may influence the events unfolding in the story.\n\nAs Raziel is slowly losing his mind due to radiation and is dissatisfied with serving the Hybrids, you could explore his internal struggle and how it impacts his decisions. This could lead to interesting plot twists and revelations, as Raziel's loyalties are tested, and he may take unexpected actions.\n\nLena and her allies may gradually uncover more information about Nate's powers and the influence he had on the events in the first novel. This process of discovery can serve as a driving force behind Lena's journey and motivate her actions throughout the story.\n\nMr. Gray's lack of full awareness of Nate's powers can create an interesting dynamic, as he tries to regain his power and influence. He might attempt to manipulate the Hybrids, Lena, and other characters to achieve his goals, all while trying to piece together the true nature of Nate's abilities and their connection to Tiamat.\n\nBy incorporating these elements into your second novel, you can create a story full of mystery, intrigue, and character-driven conflict.

In fact, my first line of code at the company was in Excel, and I'm so excited to show you how Microsoft 365 Copilot is coming to life in the products millions of people use and rely on every day.\n00:27\nWhat if the tools could learn how you work rather than the other way around? Copilot unlocks all the richness of these apps through natural language. Let's start with a real life example, like a high school graduation. My daughter recently graduated from high school, so this is really top of mind for me.\n00:47\nLet's say I want to throw her an amazing graduation party. To start, I need to send an invitation to family and friends. So let's put Copilot to work. With a few simple prompts, Copilot understands everything it needs to know to generate a great first draft of the invitation. It's even able to pull in details about the venue from an email I received last week.\n01:14\nNow I have a draft invite that includes the basic information. I can edit this, I can ask my guests to share funny stories and give them a link where they can upload photos. Now, I think this first draft is a little wordy, so let's make it more concise. With that done, this is my opportunity to create a loving and, let's be honest, a little embarrassing slideshow to celebrate the occasion.\n01:43\nI kick things off with Copilot, providing a little information to get started. I add some details about my daughter. I can also change the style so we create something fun and festive and Copilot goes to work finding the right words and searching my OneDrive for the best photos. In seconds, Copilot generates a beautiful presentation with memories, accomplishments, and advice for the future.\n02:15\nI can add my own personal touches to it and Copilot will be at my side. Now let's look at this slide. I'm really happy with the design, but Copilot didn't quite have what it needed, so I'm going to rework the text. I can then ask Copilot to make it more concise and add images. Okay, now that looks great.\n02:35\nOn this next slide, there's a part that Copilot didn't quite get right, so I'll rewrite it so that it sounds a little bit more like me. I also want to use a different image here, so I'll just tell Copilot what I want, and Copilot will find it. I can add transitions between the slides, which I always forget, so that when I play the presentation, it looks really polished.\n03:00\nOkay, I like how that turned out. Now, I don't know about you, but PowerPoint animations have never been my strong suit. I love that I can do this on my own. The average person uses less than 10% of what PowerPoint can do. Copilot unlocks the other 90%. Now on to party planning. I'll start with a few details about the event and once again, Copilot goes to work.\n03:31\nWith a simple prompt it creates pages for everything I need to think about to plan this party. Let\u2019s say I want to put this plan in a simple to do list. Boom. Done. I'm thinking about what I want to say to my daughter on her big day. Copilot can get me started on a speech. I'm not sure how long I want it to be, but let's start with 3 minutes.\n04:00\nI know I want to tell her how proud I am, acknowledge how hard she's worked, how inspired I am by her volunteer efforts, and what a wonderful leader she is. Here's a great first draft. Now, here's an important thing about Copilot. At this point, I decide whether to keep this draft, modify it, or discard it completely.\n04:25\nThis is a big change in how people interact with software. Okay, so this looks pretty good. But let's add some of the funny stories I collected from friends and family. Let's give it a minute. I can make these stories more playful and add more, but I actually want to make them a bit shorter. Let's get to the punchline, right? There, much better.\n04:52\nNow, this looks pretty good, but I really want to add my own personal touch, so I am going to edit it. You can see that throughout the writing process, I am always in control. Now I want to quickly format it to make sure I nail the delivery and Copilot automatically adjusts the spacing, making it easier for me to read and adds speaker cues to help me improve my delivery.\n05:18\nLet's shift gears into business mode. You saw how Copilot saves me time as a working mom, but the real power of Copilot is in how it unleashes creativity at work. Imagine you're leading a team at a global manufacturing company and you want to create a rock solid customer proposal and you don't have time for writer's block.\n05:44\nLet's see how Copilot can use your customer notes in OneNote, as well as another internal document. Copilot quickly creates a first draft. Now, you probably want this to look like your previous proposals. Copilot can give you a draft in the format you typically use. It inserts product images and pulls in relevant visuals from other files.\n06:13\nYou can even include a short summary at the top of the document and Copilot can make suggestions to strengthen the proposal, like adding an FAQ, which it will generate for you. Now remember, you're not going to send this off to a customer without a thorough review. But Copilot still saved you tons of time in the process.\n06:40\nIt's time to get ready for your customer pitch meeting. Now, everyone has had a moment when they wish they could turn their proposal into a customer ready presentation without having to start from scratch. Well, guess what? Now you can. Copilot can turn your Word document into a PowerPoint presentation.\n07:04\nNow you have a professional looking presentation that you can hone and polish. This is truly amazing. Using just your words, Copilot translates Word into PowerPoint and PowerPoint into Word. Now let's add a slide and give Copilot some quick instructions. There it goes. Ready for you to review. Now, this slide is a little bit wordy.\n07:32\nLet's ask Copilot to make it more visual. And check this out. Copilot can even animate the slide. It gives it a professional design treatment in a single click, but it doesn't stop there. Copilot can even generate speaker notes. I am serious. Speaker notes. It's not only a time saver, it's helping me be a better presenter and close this deal.\n08:01\nLet's jump into Copilot in Excel. Copilot puts all the rich capabilities of Excel at your fingertips. Say you need to analyze this quarter's sales results. You start by asking Copilot to analyze the data and give you three key trends. Within seconds, you've got what you need, but you want to drill in.\n08:25\nYou ask Copilot a follow up question about one of the trends. Copilot creates a new sheet. This new sheet creates a sandbox to play in to better understand what's going on without modifying the data in the original sheet. This is a great example of how Copilot up levels your skills, showing you how to break down the problem step-by-step.\n08:52\nYou ask Copilot to visualize what contributed to the decline in sales growth this period. Copilot adds a little color to make the problem jump off the page. Now you want to dig deeper and ask a follow up question. Copilot not only answers your question, it creates a simple model of the scenario and it even asks you if you want to learn more about what it did with a step-by-step breakdown.\n09:24\nFinally, you can ask it to create a graph of your projected model. Copilot turned a sea of data into clear insights and actions. Let me show you how Copilot can help you tackle your email. We all struggle with the pull of the inbox. Sometimes it keeps us from focusing on our most important work. But at the same time, you do have important emails to respond to.\n09:52\nCopilot separates the signal from the noise and gives you hours of time back. Copilot can help you triage your inbox, highlighting the most important emails to prioritize. And Copilot also helps you on the go in Outlook mobile. It can summarize long email threads, you can draft a reply using data from an Excel file and Copilot will generate a reply for you.\n10:23\nYou can edit it, you can make it more concise, you can even change the writing style or add more context. Now all that's left to do is review the proposed response and hit send. Copilot is a productivity game changer.Share Prompt"}]}

It supports instant loading states and concurrent rendering. This means navigation maintains client-side state, avoids expensive re-renders, is interruptible, and doesn't cause race conditions.\n\nThere are two ways to navigate between routes:\n\n Component\nuseRouter Hook\nThis page will go through how to use , useRouter(), and dive deeper into how navigation works.\n\n Component\n is a React component that extends the HTML element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n\nUsage\nTo use , import it from next/link, and pass a href prop to the component:\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n return Dashboard;\n}\nThere are optional props you can pass to . See the API reference for more information.\n\nExample: Linking to Dynamic Segments\nWhen linking to dynamic segments, you can use template literals and interpolation to generate a list of links. For example, to generate a list of blog posts:\n\napp/blog/PostList.jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nexport default function PostList({ posts }) {\n return (\n \n {posts.map((post) => (\n * {post.title}\n\n ))}\n \n\n );\n}\nuseRouter() Hook\nThe useRouter hook allows you to programmatically change routes inside Client Components.\n\nTo use useRouter, import it from next/navigation, and call the hook inside your Client Component:\n\n'use client';\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n const router = useRouter();\n\n return (\n router.push('/dashboard')}>\n Dashboard\n \n );\n}\nThe useRouter provides methods such as push(), refresh(), and more. See the API reference for more information.\n\nRecommendation: Use the component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using useRouter.\n\nHow Navigation Works\nA route transition is initiated using or calling router.push().\nThe router updates the URL in the browser\u2019s address bar.\nThe router avoids unnecessary work by re-using segments that haven't changed (e.g. shared layouts) from the client-side cache. This is also referred to as partial rendering.\nIf the conditions of soft navigation are met, the router fetches the new segment from the cache rather than the server. If not, the router performs a hard navigation and fetches the Server Component payload from the server.\nIf created, loading UI is shown from the server while the payload is being fetched.\nThe router uses the cached or fresh payload to render the new segments on the client.\nClient-side Caching of Rendered Server Components\nGood to know: This client-side cache is different from the server-side Next.js HTTP cache.\n\nThe new router has an in-memory client-side cache that stores the rendered result of Server Components (payload). The cache is split by route segments which allows invalidation at any level and ensures consistency across concurrent renders.\n\nAs users navigate around the app, the router will store the payload of previously fetched segments and prefetched segments in the cache.\n\nThis means, for certain cases, the router can re-use the cache instead of making a new request to the server. This improves performance by avoiding re-fetching data and re-rendering components unnecessarily.\n\nInvalidating the Cache\nThe cache can be invalidated using router.refresh(). For more information, see the API reference. In the future, mutations will automatically invalidate the cache.\n\nPrefetching\nPrefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before it's visited. The rendered result of prefetched routes is added to the router's client-side cache. This makes navigating to a prefetched route near-instant.\n\nBy default, routes are prefetched as they become visible in the viewport when using the component. This can happen when the page first loads or through scrolling. Routes can also be programmatically prefetched using the prefetch method of the useRouter() hook.\n\nStatic and Dynamic Routes:\n\nIf the route is static, all the Server Component payloads for the route segments will be prefetched.\nIf the route is dynamic, the payload from the first shared layout down until the first loading.js file is prefetched. This reduces the cost of prefetching the whole route dynamically and allows instant loading states for dynamic routes.\nGood to know:\n\nPrefetching is only enabled in production.\nPrefetching can be disabled by passing prefetch={false} to .\nHard Navigation\nOn navigation, the cache is invalidated and the server refetches data and re-renders the changed segments.\n\nSoft Navigation\nOn navigation, the cache for changed segments is reused (if it exists), and no new requests are made to the server for data.\n\nConditions for Soft Navigation\nOn navigation, Next.js will use soft navigation if the route you are navigating to has been prefetched, and either doesn't include dynamic segments or has the same dynamic parameters as the current route.\n\nFor example, consider the following route that includes a dynamic [team] segment: /dashboard/[team]/\\*. The cached segments below /dashboard/[team]/\\* will only be invalidated when the [team] parameter changes.\n\nNavigating from /dashboard/team-red/\\* to /dashboard/team-red/\\* will be a soft navigation.\nNavigating from /dashboard/team-red/\\* to /dashboard/team-blue/\\* will be a hard navigation.\nBack/Forward Navigation\nBack and forward navigation (popstate event) has a soft navigation behavior. This means, the client-side cache is re-used and navigation is near-instant.\n\nFocus and Scroll Management\nBy default, Next.js will set focus and scroll into view the segment that's changed on navigation. The importance of this accessibility and usability feature will be more apparent when advanced routing patterns are implemented.\n\nGood to know: Next.js used to wrap each segment in a div element to achieve this behavior. This is now fixed as on the latest Next.js canary. Update to next@canary to get the latest fixes.\n\nNext Steps\n`next/link` API Reference\nPerform client-side route transitions.\n`useRouter` API Reference\nProgrammatically navigate to a new route. \"\"\""}]}

Pyszczynski et al., 1990). \nMany of the studies showing that MS increases self-esteem striving indicate that how one does that depends on the culturally-valued kinds of behaviors in which a given individual has invested their self-esteem. For example, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al. (1999) showed that MS increased bold driving among Israeli soldiers who based their self-worth partly on driving skill, but did not do so for soldiers who did not base self-worth partly on their driving skill. Zestcott et al. (2016) considered that if people can attain self-esteem through sports, and MS motivates people to increase strivings for self-esteem, then people who value sports and care about their performance may try to improve their performance more when primed with death. In support of this hypothesis, the researchers chose only (male) participants who valued their basketball playing ability and found that death primes (compared to neutral primes) improved their performance in a \u201cone-on-one\u201d basketball game against a research confederate (Study 1) and led to higher scores in a one-minute basketball shooting task (Study 2). Furthermore, in the shooting task study, the researchers also used a mediational analysis to demonstrate that the improvement in the shooting task following death primes was associated with increased task-related self-esteem (satisfaction with themselves). This analysis indicated that death primes did not directly increase selfesteem, but that there was a positive indirect effect of death primes on task related self-esteem though improved performance in the task (only those who actually improved benefited). \nPeople may also attain self-esteem by strengthening their identification with successful groups and \u201cbasking in their reflected glory\u201d (e.g., Cialdini et al., 1976). Studies in the framework of TMT indicate that after MS, people are more likely to identify themselves with and defend their in-groups (e.g., Castano et al., 2003; Greenberg et al., 1990), especially when their groups are perceived as having high collective continuity or \u201ctemporal endurance\u201d (Sani et al., 2009; Smeekes & Verkuyten, 2013). Lifshin et al. (2017) found that American college students who experience the death of a close other are more likely to care about their national identity and rate it as important to them, and that such increased identification is associated with a slightly higher level of self-esteem. Aside from increasing self-esteem by living up to cultural standards and values, people also try to maintain their self-esteem after MS by distancing themselves from groups when such identification might risk their sense of self-worth (Arndt et al., 2002). Nevertheless, because self-esteem is ultimately dependent on the integrity of cultural worldviews, which provide individuals with avenues for attaining immortality, self-enhancement might only be a desired avenue for terror management strategy if it does not challenge important aspects of the cultural worldview (e.g., Landau et al., 2009). \nThe MS hypothesis has been supported by research that experimentally manipulated death primes in randomized experimental and field settings. These primes can be manipulated in a number of ways, including open-ended questions about death, subliminal (below conscious perception) or subtle priming of death-related words or images, search puzzles containing death-related words, images or reminders of terrorism or natural catastrophes, proximity to cemeteries, T-shirts with an image of a skull, and more (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2014). Although various types of threats other than death, such as feelings of uncertainty, loss of control, or general anxiety, may also induce defenses, most of the studies testing the MS hypothesis found that the effects of thinking about death and mortality are different from the effects of other aversive subjects (e.g., Greenberg et al., 1994; Martens et al., 2011; Pyszczynski et al., 2006; for a review, see Hart, 2019). Importantly, TMT research indicates that the effects of MS operate in a two-stage process (Pyszczynski et al., 1999; Greenberg et al., 1994). First, death related cognitions are pushed outside of focal attention using \u201cproximal defenses\u201d such as denial or rationalization (\u201cnot me, not now\u201d). These suppressed death thoughts are nevertheless still cognitively accessible outside of conscious awareness, creating the potential for death anxiety. At this point, \u201cdistal defenses\u201d that bestow people with psychological security, such as self-esteem striving, operate to manage this potential and keep death-related anxiety at bay (e.g., Arndt et al., 1997). \nThe Anxiety-Buffer Hypothesis \n \nThe anxiety-buffer hypothesis states that \u201cif a psychological structure [e.g., self-esteem] provides protection against anxiety, then augmenting that structure should reduce anxiety in response to subsequent threat\u201d (Greenberg et al., 1997, p. 72). Stated differently, if self-esteem protects people from anxiety, then bolstering or affirming self-esteem should reduce anxiety and mitigate other forms of defensiveness. \nMany studies have found correlational evidence for the anxiety buffering function of self-esteem, indicating that low self-esteem (as measured by self-report) is typically associated with higher anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (e.g., Higgins, 1987; Lipsitt, 1958; Rosenberg, 1962; Rosenberg & Simmons, 1972; for a meta-analysis, see Sowislo & Orth, 2013). However, to know if self-esteem actually causes decreased anxiety after threat, one would need to experimentally manipulate increased self-esteem, and then measure its protective capacity. \nIn the first experiment testing this hypothesis, Greenberg et al. (1992) increased participants\u2019 self-esteem by providing them with fake feedback about their personality that was either positive (\u201cWhile you may feel that you have some personality weaknesses, your personality is fundamentally strong\u201d) or neutral (\u201cWhile you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them\u201d), and then exposed them to highly-graphic images of death (Study 1), or had them anticipating a mild electric shock (Studies 2 and 3). In line with the anxiety-buffer hypothesis, participants who received the self-esteem boost reported lower levels of self-reported state-anxiety in Study 1, and had reduced physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance response) while anticipating painful shocks in Studies 2 and 3. More recent research has shown that MS increases death anxiety and other negative emotional states in low self-esteem but not high self-esteem individuals (Abeyta et al., 2014; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012; Routledge et al., 2010; for a review, see Juhl and Routledge, 2016). \nBeyond reducing conscious feelings of anxiety, increased self-esteem has also been found to mitigate the effect of MS on distal defenses such as worldview defense and self-esteem striving. Harmon-Jones et al. (1997) demonstrated that providing American students with bogus positive feedback (as compared to neutral feedback) moderated the degree to which MS increased their defense of America (pro-U.S. bias) compared to the control condition. Although students in the neutral feedback condition had elevated pro-U.S. bias after thinking about death compared to after thinking about a control topic (watching television), there was no difference in pro-U.S. bias between the MS and control group among students who received positive feedback about their personality (self-esteem boost). Thus, the increase in self-esteem had provided them a sense of psychological security and reduced their need to further attain protection by defending their cultural worldview. Other studies have since replicated the moderating effect that self-esteem enhancement has on MS-related responses (e.g., Schmeichel & Martens, 2005). For example, in regard to self-esteem striving, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al. (1999) showed that although MS increased driving speed among Israeli soldiers who perceived driving as relevant to their self-esteem, this effect was eliminated if participants were first provided with (fake) positive personality feedback. \nStudies also show that dispositionally high self-esteem (i.e., traitlevel self-esteem) can also sometimes moderate the effect of MS on human thought and behavior (e.g., Harmon-Jones et al., 1997). However, high trait self-esteem has also been found to have opposite effects in some contexts, such as increased defensiveness in certain situations (e.g., Baldwin & Wesley, 1996; Landau & Greenberg, 2006; McGregor et al., 2007). One explanation for this inconsistency is that the ability of selfesteem to provide assuaging psychological protection might depend on more nuanced distinctions between different kinds of high self-esteem. For example, studies by Schmeichel et al. (2009) demonstrated that implicit high self-esteem (a more unconscious sense of self-worth), measured by implicit association tasks, provides stronger defense against MS compared to explicit self-esteem (conscious evaluations of selfworth), measured \""}]}

Think of the best experience you have ever had being part of a team (could be a work team, sports team, a community/recreational group, etc.). What was it about that team that made it such a great experience? The best team experience I've ever had was when I worked on a cross-functional team to launch a new product for our company. The team was made up of members from various departments, including engineering, design, marketing, and sales, and we had to work closely together to get the product to market. Here are a few of the factors that contributed to the fantastic experience: 1. Clearly defined goals and a common purpose: From the start, our team's goal was to successfully launch the new product. We all understood what we were aiming for and why it was critical. Having a common goal kept us focused and motivated throughout the project. 2. Trust and respect: Our team members came from various backgrounds and areas of expertise, but we respected each other's viewpoints and worked collaboratively. We also had faith in one another to do our jobs well, so we could delegate tasks and responsibilities without micromanaging. 3. Success celebration: When the product was finally released, the entire group celebrated together. We recognized everyone's hard work and dedication, and were pleased of what we had accomplished. Generally speaking, the experience was positive because the team was capable of working efficiently and collaboratively toward a common goal. We were able to trust and rely on each other because our communication was open, respectful, and clear. Furthermore, the team was able to remain flexible and adaptable, allowing them to find alternatives when the unexpected occurred. Finally, the team celebrated their accomplishments as a group, which promotes positive motivation and a sense of belonging to a team. \n\n2. What is one thing that your learning team is doing well? Which of the Team Conditions or Team Emotional Intelligence norms do you think is an area of strength for your team? I work on a team that places a high value on effective communication and empathy. My voice has been heard and my ideas have been valued since the beginning. The team promotes open and truthful communication, and I am comfortable sharing my ideas and concerns without fear of being judged or facing repercussions. As the project proceeds, I recognize that the team members consistently show empathy for one another. They take the time to actively listen, understand each other's points of view, and consider the consequences of their actions on others. When a team member is having difficulty, the other members of the group offers assistance and collaborates to find a solution. This empathetic and open communication environment has fostered a strong sense of confidence and supportiveness within the team. I feel safe taking risks and sharing my vulnerabilities because I know the team will support me and work together to transcend any obstacles. Furthermore, the team's goals and roles are clear, and everyone understands their role in achieving those goals. We share a sense of purpose, which drives us to work hard and deliver high-quality results. This clarity and alignment have enabled us to remain focused and productive in the face of unforeseen obstacles. \n\n3. What is one thing your learning team could be doing better? Which of the Team Conditions or Team Emotional Intelligence norms do you think is an area of opportunity for improvement for your team? How can you contribute to improving in these areas? Whereas my team excels at good communication and compassion, I believe we could do better in terms of accountability. It is sometimes unclear who is accountable for specific tasks or deliverables, which can cause delays and confusions. I presume that by constructing clear objectives and roles, we could profit from reinforcing the Team Condition. We can ensure that everyone is responsible for their part in the project by setting clear what is anticipated of each team member and setting performance targets. To help improve in this area, I intend to be more proactive in clarifying roles and responsibilities. Because once preconceptions are unclear, I will make an effort to ask questions and seek clarification, and I will collaborate with my teammates to set attainable goals and create a common sense of responsibility. I also think we could benefit from strengthening our Team Emotional Intelligence norm of assertiveness. We can ensure that our requirements and goals are clearly communicated and that issues are addressed in a timely manner by being more assertive in our communication. I intend to work on my own assertiveness skills to help me improve in this area. I will work hard to communicate my goals and requirements clearly, and I will motivate my groupmates to do the same. We can focus on ensuring that our communication is straightforward and productive, and that everybody's needs are met, by being more assertive. \n\n4. What were your thoughts, feelings, or reactions to what happened in the course this week (including readings/videos, class activities, small learning teams, etc.)? This week's course content on Team Emotional Intelligence was especially interesting to me. It was fascinating to discover the various elements of emotional intelligence and how they can be used in a team setting. I valued the opportunity to assess my own social skills and identify areas for improvement. The course's exercises and examples helped me understand how to be self-aware, organize my emotions, and enhance my communication with my teammates. The discussion on Team Conditions was also useful in comprehending how teams can become more effective and productive. It was fascinating to learn about the various factors that contribute to team success and to find issues where our team could optimize. Overall, I found this week's content to be very informative and applicable to our team. I'm inspired to put what I've learned into practice and collaborate with my members of the team to continue improving our emotional maturity and start creating a more efficient team environment. \n\n5. Based on what you did and what you learned this past week (including any experiments you tried or risks you took), what would you like to try in the coming week? What would represent a risk or stretch for you--something slightly out of your comfort zone? What is one \"next step\u201d for you to apply and expand your learning? I've observed that as an assertive team member, I frequently dominate conversations and team meetings. Despite the fact that I think communication requires assertiveness, I also understand the value of allowing others the time and space to express their thoughts and viewpoints. I want to make an effort to give others more room in our team meetings starting next week. For me, this would be a stretch because it can be challenging to keep my mouth shut when I have strong feelings or ideas. To achieve this goal, I plan to take the following steps: I will endeavor to actively listen to what others have to say rather than just thinking about my own thoughts and opinions. This entails refraining from interjecting, paying close attention, and seeking clarification when necessary. Share with others: I'll try to persuade people to talk about their thoughts and perspectives. This entails directly requesting their opinions, recognizing their contributions, and providing a forum for them to speak. Be humble: I'll be humble by admitting that I don't have all the answers and that other team members might have insightful observations that I haven't thought of. I can foster a more inclusive and collaborative team environment by respecting the knowledge and viewpoints of others. All in all, I'm eager to take these actions to develop into a more inclusive and collaborative team member. I may find it difficult, but I think our team's success and the caliber of our work depend on it.\""}]}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\". Introduction\n\nThese proceedings involve a dispute arising out of contract to construct two duplex homes at Oran Park.\n\nThere are in fact sets of two proceedings which were heard together, with an order that evidence in one proceeding be evidence in the other.\n\nThe plaintiff in each case is the client of the builder, which is the defendant. The two plaintiffs are father and son.\n\nAs the building works approached completion, the parties fell into dispute about the state of accounts between them on each building contract. The plaintiff's alleged that they had overpaid the builder and sought repayment of the alleged overpayment. The builder on the other hand said that the plaintiffs had underpaid, that is to say that the defendant builder was still owed money on each contract. Based on that assertion the builder refused to grant access to the duplexes.\n\nBoth sets of proceedings were commenced in the Supreme Court, with the primary relief sought being an order for specific performance of the building contracts. The parties resolved that aspect of their dispute by a commercial compromise entered into, on a without admissions basis, pursuant to which the builder agreed to finalise the works, and give possession to the plaintiffs.\n\nThis sensible commercial approach to the specific performance aspect of the litigation unfortunately did not extend to the balance of the proceedings, that is to say to the resolution of the issue of who owed what to whom. As on any view of it, the sums in dispute were comfortably within the monetary jurisdiction of this Court and the matter was transferred by the Supreme Court to this Court.\n\nI should also add that the builder has not cross claimed in order to recover what he alleges the plaintiffs owe him. As such the only disputes remaining for resolution involve the plaintiffs\u2019 case.\n\nWhen the matter was called on before me the parties opened on the basis that there were several major points of disagreement between them which required resolution by me, and that once I had resolved those major points the balance of the disagreement between them was basically a matter of accounting only (TP 17.5 \u2013 25)\n\nThe Major Issues\n\nThe major points requiring resolution as identified by the parties were:\n\nhow payments of $30,000 made by each plaintiff to Camden Council in respect of section 94 contributions were to be dealt with in the accounting between the plaintiffs and defendant (\u201cthe Camden Council Issue\u201d);\n\nwhether the plaintiff Giuseppe Carbone made a cash payment to the defendant in the sum of $60,000 which needed to be brought into account in the accounting between the parties (\u201cthe Cash Payment Issue\u201d);\n\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled to damages against the defendant on account of rent which was forgone, in the period between when they say they should have been given possession of the duplexes, and when they in fact were given possession (\u201cthe Rent Issue\u201d).\n\nUnfortunately, in final submissions both parties relied on what were in effect evidentiary summary documents summarising documents in evidence which suggested that there were still remaining disputes between them, independent of the major points to which I have just referred. These disputes seemed to be matters of accounting.\n\nIn these reasons I shall determine the Major Points and shall direct parties to bring in short minutes of order which reflect my reasons. If the parties thereafter continue to remain in dispute about the accounting between them, I shall appoint a referee to inquire into and report to the Court on the proper accounting between the parties on each building contract, in the light of my reasons.\n\nThe Pleadings\n\nIt is necessary to analyse the pleadings.\n\nThe Statement of Claim pleads that the building contracts in each case provided for various adjustments to the contract price arising out of variations (see [5] \u2013 [7]).\n\nThe pleader then pleads the self same variation credits as being represented by the defendant to be allowable to the plaintiffs in their favour. These are defined as the \u201cCredit Representations\u201d. The Statement of Claim then pleads reliance on the \u201cCredit Representations\u201d. After pleading that the Credit Representations were made in trade and commerce, the Statement of Claim alleges that the Credit Representations were misleading and deceptive pursuant to the provisions of s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law [12]. The pleading continues that in the premises the defendant is estopped from denying the variation credits in their favour, and is estopped from exercising contractual rights in relation to them [13].\n\nThe pleading also alleges that the defendant should be restrained from exercising contractual rights pursuant to s 232 of the Australian Consumer Law [13(iii)].\n\nThe pleading then reverts to pleading further variations some of which the plaintiff says were signed, some unsigned.\n\nThe Statement of Claim then pleads amounts paid by each plaintiff to the defendant on account of progress payments. In both proceedings the plaintiffs include the sum of $30,000 paid to Camden Council the subject of the Camden Council Issue, and in respect of Giuseppe Carbone the $60,000 allegedly paid in cash [19].\nThe pleading then at paragraph 22 alleges an overpayment by each plaintiff. The Statement of Claim then proceeds to plead that the defendant had refused to repay the overpayment as a result of which each plaintiff suffered loss and damage being the alleged over payment ([24]-[25]).\n\nImportantly, the loss and damage claimed does not include a claim for forgone rent.\n\nThe overpayment case is not pleaded as a claim in contract. It is quite unclear from the pleading to date, what the jurisdictional basis of the plaintiff's claim in respect of the overpayment. Logically one would have thought that the claim in respect of alleged overpayments arises out of a claim for monies had and received, which indeed is what the pleading goes on to separately plead (see [27 \u2013 31]).\n\nThe pleading then pleads:\n\nIn respect of the plaintiff Giuseppe Carbone, the failure of the defendant to credit to the sum of $59,543 which it says was reflected in a receipt issued by the defendant.\n\nIn respect of the same plaintiff the failure of the defendant to credit to the plaintiff in the sum of $60,000 said to be paid in cash.\n\nThe defendant\u2019s assertion that it was owed a substantial sum by the plaintiff.\n\nThe defendants refusal to complete the construction and give the plaintiff\u2019s possession; and\n\nThe defendants purported termination of the Building Contract.\n\nThese matters were defined as \u201cThe Conduct\u201d.\n\nThe Statement of Claim then pleads that The Conduct, constitutes unconscientious dealing by the defendant within the meaning of s 20 and 21 of the Australian Consumer Law [33] \u2013 [52].\n\nThe $60,000 cash payment allegation is obviously not pleaded by the plaintiff Matthew Carbone, but unconscionable conduct is pleaded by both defendants. The pleading in each case then pleads that both defendants have suffered loss and damage by dint of the unconscionable conduct of the defendant.\n\nGiuseppe Carbone also pleads deceit in respect of the $60,000 alleged cash payment.\n\nBoth claim damages which includes the rent claim. It is important to note however that the rent claim is only made in the case of Giuseppe Carbone, as arising from the unconscionable conduct claim, and the deceit claim. The plaintiff Matthew Carbone seeks to recover the rent claim as arising solely from the unconscionable conduct claim.\n\nIn final submissions I drew this fact to the attention of Mr Barham of Counsel, who appeared for the defendant, who had been submitting that his clients are entitled to the rent claim on the basis of a breach of contract. I indicated to him that I did not believe that his submission could be made out on the pleadings. After debate between Bench and Bar, Mr Barham sought, and was granted a short adjournment, in order to allow him to take instructions as to whether he wished to seek leave to amend the Statement of Claim. After that short adjournment Mr Barham advised that he did not wish to seek leave to amend.\n\nFinally, I should add that both plaintiffs claim exemplary damages."}]}

{"timestamp": 10153, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2085, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER SEVEN\n RULE #2\n Be Still So You Can Heal (The Neutral Spine)\n From Jeremy\nLet\u2019s assume that you are beginning to get the big picture. And that you have also begun to identify the \u201cdumb\u201d things that you\u2019ve been doing to wreck your back, and that you have stopped doing them. Good. Now it is time to start the healing, and that is a matter of immobilizing your lower back or lumbar spine so it can heal, after all those years of doing things that hurt it. \nThe analogy is not perfect, but think of your tortured back as being like a broken arm or leg. When you break an arm, say, the doc puts it in a stiff cast so you can\u2019t bang it or twist it and to give it time and rest to heal. The same with your back, except we can\u2019t do anything quite as dramatic as put you in a whole-body cast for your damaged back. What we can do is show you how to carry yourself so that you effectively immobilize your lower back. It\u2019s not totally easy, but it will work. And bear in mind, if you do not immobilize your back, it will not heal\u2014simple as that. Indeed, it may get worse. \nWhat do I mean by \u201cimmobilizing\u201d your lumbar spine? I do not mean that you can\u2019t sit or walk or have a more or less normal life. What I do mean is that you have to be really serious about maintaining a neutral spine, all the time. Maintaining a neutral spine is at the heart of your cure, and will be at the heart of your life after your cure. This is the time to learn how to achieve a neutral spine and how to maintain it all the time, even when doing various movements. \nThe spine is a meticulously engineered piece of machinery, but it has a lot of redundancy built in. By this I mean that unlike the knee or shoulder, in the spine when you have a bad joint, the surrounding structures can \u201chelp\u201d bear the loads, and you can function more or less normally and without pain. Take the pressure of bad posture\u2014and dumb movement patterns\u2014off, and there is very likely enough \u201croom\u201d in this spine for the sufferer to have a normal life. For example, the \u201choles\u201d where the nerves come out of the spine (the foramina) are still big enough for the nerves to exit, pain-free, if you\u2019re not squeezing the area with lousy posture. In the same vein, there is probably still enough cushion in the flattened disc to support a correctly aligned spine (but not a bent or misshapen one). And so on. \n\u201cNeutral\u201d means the position in which the least amount of problem loads occur, all up and down the spine. The \u201cproblem loads\u201d in some pictures we\u2019ve shown are extreme, but even those inflamed joints and nerve roots will likely calm down if you leave them alone for a while. Which is to say, if you keep your spine in neutral. As bad as those injuries are (and as long as it took someone to create them) there is a strong chance that that sufferer can go about his or her life, with a neutral spine, in little or no pain. \nLearning to keep a neutral spine is not totally easy. And learning to maintain it all the time is harder. But this is the \u201ccast\u201d that lets your body heal. It is worth going to a lot of trouble to get this right. And it is a lesson that you will use for the rest of your life, long after the problem area has \u201chealed.\u201d \nOkay, step one is understanding the concept of neutral spine. Step two is learning to find it and lock it in place, and keep it in place forever (which we will teach you in Chapter 9).\nThe neutral spine is the position that allows your spine to do its job with the least amount of stress and load. And\u2014if you have already damaged your back\u2014it is the position that results in the least amount of new damage or pain.\nFor most people, the picture on the left is the neutral spine. The other two are not.\nNeutral Spine \n\nGOOD BAD\nNote the gentle curve of the lower back in the \u201cgood\u201d spine. For the majority of you, this is how your neutral spine will look. If you have developed significant degenerative changes or were born with significant abnormalities (it happens, but not a lot), your neutral spine may look a bit different. For now assume that your neutral spine looks like one on the guy on the left. Spines vary, and you may have your own unique neutral spine that is a little different from this. Whatever your own neutral spine, that is the position you want to maintain as you go about your daily life. It is also the position in which you feel the least pain. Again, maintaining a neutral spine is a fundamental behavioral change for most people. And it is readily doable. In a few months\u2019 time, I predict that it will be natural and you will scarcely need to think about it. One of the near-magic presences in our lives is \u201cmuscle memory.\u201d Maintain your spine correctly for a while and muscle memory takes over. Then it is just a question of seeing to it that your muscles are strong enough to do their job. \nHow do you keep your spine neutral and still be a dynamic, moving, active human being? By learning to brace your neutral spine with your core (Chapter 9) and maximizing movement in your hips (as opposed to your lower back). As Chris mentioned in Chapter 6, one of our cardinal rules is \u201cThou shalt not bend or twist with thy lower back.\u201d And you don\u2019t need to. You can rotate from side to side and bend forward and back using your hips. You do not need to flex or twist your lower back. \nYou may ask: Isn\u2019t range of motion important for the lumbar spine? Answer: Not really. At least, it is usually the least important factor for someone who has had significant back pain, and should be reintroduced only after pain has stopped. Most people who have experienced regular, serious back pain have already sustained significant wear and tear on the spine. The general pattern I see is a combination of two things: first, worn-down vertebral joints that are hypomobile (stiff), secondary to arthritic changes and degeneration; second, lumbar vertebral joints that are hypermobilie (loose), due to overstretched ligaments and atrophied muscles. These problems are best resolved when we protect the spine by bracing and \u201clocking down\u201d the lumbar spine and moving in a manner that completely changes the axis of motion from the lumbar spine to the hips and shoulder girdle. You can eventually introduce some gentle lumbar range-of-motion exercises in non-loaded ways. This is what the \u201cCat/Camel\u201d exercise that we introduce later is for. Small, gentle lumbar range-of-motion exercise is necessary for things like synovial joint lubrication, the reduction of friction between vertebral segments and discs, and disc nutrition, among other things. For example, walking requires a few degrees of freedom between the lumbar vertebral joints (3 or 4 degrees rotation) with coordinated muscle contractions to enhance stabilization and supply necessary lubrication and nutrition to discs and joints. For our purposes, we recommend keeping lumbar motion to a minimum, especially until your pain is gone. Once that occurs, you should make only healthy, non-loaded, non-repetitive lumbar movements, such as those necessary for walking and the cat and camel exercise. Spinal stability, core endurance, hip mobility, and core and gluteal strength are far more important for maintaining a healthy spine once you\u2019ve had back pain. You can do just fine in life with almost no rotation or excessive movement in your lower back. Let your hips do the work, and your risk of recurring back pain is sharply reduced. \nFinding Your Neutral Spine \nFinding your neutral spine can be a bit tricky for some but you can do it. Here\u2019s what you do. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Try to relax everything in your body, and just breathe. Then let\u2019s start by performing a pelvic tilt. \nTo do that, flatten your lower back into the floor (see top drawing), and curl your tailbone upward. This is a \u201cposterior pelvic tilt,\u201d if you want to put a name to it. Now, arch your back so that your lower back comes off of the floor (middle drawing), and point your tailbone toward the ground (an \u201canterior pelvic tilt\u201d). Now, slowly go back and forth between those two motions a few times (bottom drawing). Find the position of your lower back between these two extremes (flattening your back or arching it) that feels the most comfortable to you, and stop there. This is your neutral spine. It may take a few tries but it\u2019s not hard.\nFinding Your Neutral Spine\n\nStop here for a second. You have just reached an important point, and you don\u2019t want to \u201close\u201d it. Everyone\u2019s neutral spine is a bit different depending on the anatomical condition of their lumbar spine. For most people, there will be a gentle curve in the lower back. For those who already have some kind of a disc bulge, their neutral spine might be more arched (butt more extended). For those with spinal stenosis, their neutral spine may be a little more flattened than the one in the picture on the previous page. Don\u2019t worry about it. Whatever feels the most comfortable for you is your neutral spine for now. In time, your neutral spine will likely become more like the \u201cnormal\u201d picture as pain and inflammation subside.\nThink about your neutral spine and assume that position all the time until it becomes second nature\u2014until \u201cmuscle memory\u201d takes over. \nNext, we move on to a discussion of techniques to help you maintain a neutral spine. But first, Chris is going to tell you why it is very likely you haven\u2019t heard of these concepts before."}]}
{"timestamp": 10219, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2158, "Output Length": 11, "prompt": "From the book 'Golden Grant Rules' by David Kincade:\nUNDERSTANDING GOVERNMENT\n37. Understand how government works: federalism\nIn Canada and the United States, our constitutions are similar in terms of federalism.\nSimply put, federalism means we have two levels of government: provincial/federal in Canada and state/federal in the USA.\nSince most \"voters\" or citizens do not easily understand which level of government is responsible for specific services, voters want elected officials to \"do something.\" (e.g., grow the economy).\nWhat happens is that both levels of government offer grants, sometimes even for the same thing!\nIn Canada, Alberta had the \"Export Support Fund,\" a grant for Alberta-based companies who want to export. Companies get grants for trade shows and other expenses abroad.\nThe federal government also has an export grant for CanExport SME (stands for small and medium-sized enterprises), which is for the same thing!\n 32\nHere is the grant writer tip: find out which application is easier to fill out before applying! In this case, the Export Support Fund was dramatically more straightforward to write than CanExport SME!\n38. Understand how government works: representative democracy\nCanada and the United States are \"representative democracies.\"\nWe elect people from a district or constituency to represent all people within that specific geographical area.\nThat elected official goes to the capital to represent everyone in their district (also known as ridings or constituencies).\nElected officials fund the bureaucracies; politicians \"sign the cheque\" that pays the bureaucrats their salaries.\nThink about that?\nMeeting your elected official is simple; inquire about their public itinerary or schedule a meeting in their local office. If you can get a \"letter of support\" from your elected official, how do you think that will help your grant application?\nPicture this scenario. You are a bureaucrat needing to choose between 1 of 2 applications. Only one application had a letter of recommendation from \"your boss.\" All things being equal, which grant application are you more likely to recommend?\nGrant tip: build a relationship with your provincial/state and federal representatives!\n39. Understand how government works: cabinet\nNot all elected officials are equal.\n33\n\nIn Canada, the premier or prime minister is the head of the political party that wins the most seats in the provincial legislature or parliament.\nThe leader chooses a \"cabinet\" from his or her party's elected candidates. These cabinet ministers are a small group of elected officials that officially form the \"government.\"\nOnce these elected officials (in Canada) are appointed to cabinet, they are known as cabinet ministers (or simply ministers).\nMinisters have the legislative authority to sign off on grants in their department. Read any grant guidelines in Canada. You will see a line that says something like, \"the minister has all the power, and they are the official government representative between you and the government.\"\nGrant Story\nWatch how powerful this line is from a grant called \"Community Initiatives Program Project-Based Grant.\"\nSection 6.11 states, \"The Minister of Culture and Tourism may exercise discretion in approving applications that fall outside the general intent of the program, based on the extent to which the applicant can demonstrate the project's potential and vital contributions to the community.\"\nGrant tip: find out who the cabinet minister is in your department and build trust with him or her. Sometimes the minister can even be your locally elected official.\nIf you attend grant events, take a guess who almost always speaks at them: ministers, of course! Ministers are responsible for the funds in the first place!\n40. Understand how government works: political parties\nPolitical parties play an essential role in Canada and the United States.\n34\n\nThe electoral system works in tandem with political parties.\nNearly all constituencies will represent a large national party, even when they have little to no chance of winning individual ridings.\nThe Canadian provincial or federal political party that wins the most seats on Election Day forms the government.\nThe electoral college system is different than a parliamentary system. Still, it works on a similar structure: the entire state goes to the political party with the most votes in each state.\nUS Political Party Story\nIn the 1992 election, independent candidate Ross Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any Electoral College states because of the relatively even distribution of support, but he did\nwin over 30% of the vote in Maine and 27% in Utah, finishing second in both states.\nCanada Political Party Story\nIn the 1987 New Brunswick election, Frank McKenna's Liberals won all 58 seats in the legislature, with 60.39% of the popular vote.\nGrant Tips: Be aware of your elected official's political philosophy and how they will view your organization/technology before you meet them.\n41. Understand how government works: election platforms\nWhen political parties run in election campaigns, they use election platforms.\nReading the party's election platform, you can predict what will happen to specific grants. If the party strongly opposes climate change, you can expect less funding for emission reductions.\n35\n\nYou might be surprised to learn how much impact individual citizens can have in shaping election platforms. Parties are usually starving for content in the lead up to elections. You can get involved early to shape future policy.\nGrant Tip\nWatch the election cycle and election platforms closely. You want to get your grant applications submitted before a new government establishes itself. In the 2019 Alberta Provincial Election, the government froze most grant spending from spring to fall. This delay caused applications to go on hold, leaving entrepreneurs wondering if they would receive funding.\n42. Understand how government works: election system\nYou should know if your local politician is on the government's side (the majority) or the opposition. This knowledge will inform you how close you are to the decision- maker.\nIn Canada and the USA, we have a \"first-past-the-post\" election system. Every candidate lines up at election time (like a horse race) in a geographical area (called a constituency, riding, or district), and only \"one\" candidate wins.\nBecause multiple candidates run in each constituency, the winning candidate often receives less than 50% of the vote. As an outcome of this electoral system, a legislature can win a majority of seats with less than 50% of the popular vote.\nFor example, if three candidates run in a district, \"Candidate A\" receives 40%, \"Candidate B\" receives \"30%, and \"Candidate C\" receives 30%, Candidate A represents 100% of the riding with only 40% of the popular vote.\nGrant Tip: Be aware of who you are dealing with. For example, does your locally elected official support Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction innovation, or are they anti-climate change? Know this information when asking for a letter of reference.\n36\n\nIf your elected official is on the side of government, you can ask how they can help you meet the minister of your grant's department.\n43. Understand government fiscal year\nMost provincial and federal government fiscal years run from April 1 to March 31.\nWhen a government refers to \"year,\" it almost always refers to a fiscal year. When the government plans to give you multi-year funding over 18 months, it is planning that on the government fiscal year, not yours.\nGrant Story\nI had a client win a significant government contribution over two years. However, the grant agency called them and asked if they could pay them upfront in March. The situation likely had to do with allocating capital in that fiscal year to help the department manage its books.\n44. Who signs the grant cheque: the minister\nThe most important person in the grant world is the minister of the department. The minister has the final say on big funding decisions, and they can make grant exceptions anytime.\nGrant Story\nI had a client going for a large non-profit capital grant. My client was told that grant staff place applications into two piles \"Recommend\" and \"Not Recommend.\" Then the bureaucrat told them the minister would take applications from the \"Not\" piles if he or she wants. The lesson: know who signs the cheques.\nRemember, elected officials are held accountable for taxpayer dollars. The buck stops with them. The system is not perfect, but it is the best we got!\n37\n\n45. Enhance the minster's mandate\nYour grant application should enhance the minister's mandate. Your chances of success are going to increase when you do that dramatically!\nWhen you write the application, you should be able to see the minister at your event presenting the cheque to you and your organization.\nElevate Aviation $426,000 grant announcement. Local MP and Minister in the background. My sister Kendra is at the podium. Keep reading! Your turn next.\n46. Understand that your audience is the taxpayer\nIf your grant doesn't \"sell\" to the taxpayer, it is likely to lose. Conversely, if your grant has a significant positive impact on taxpayers' lives, it is more likely to win.\nYour innovation or project can be complicated, so make it easy for the grant agency to understand.\n 38\n\n47. Why governments give grants\nThe easiest way for government officials to show support for something is to cut a cheque or through grants. Governments cannot possibly run every program, so grants are an excellent tool for allocating capital.\nFinally, grants work. When the government dangles free money to solve a problem, businesses put forward solutions to fix them.\n48. It's not about you \u2013 it is about them\nYour government got elected on a campaign platform. That platform is full of promises and commitments.\nWhether or not it wins the next election will have a lot to do with how well the government performed. If it fails on any of those fronts, you can imagine its competition will be all over them.\nLook at your governments' commitments. You can find them on their websites. Are they committed to reducing GHG emissions? Saving water? Seniors' Housing? Arts and Culture?\nFind out what the government wants and tailor your project to its needs. Even within government, they need to compete with other departments for funding.\nYour project should help the government tell its story. Imagine the politicians all smiling at your event with a big cheque.\n39"}]}

That's what our grocery distribution is about here at Saddleback. That's what the Peace Center is about. It's showing the love of Christ in tangible ways. The Bible says this in Colossians 3. It says, therefore, as God's chosen people, so that's you, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. I love that he says, clothe yourselves. He's saying, live in such a way that it's as though those things clothe you, that you develop a reputation for compassion and kindness and gentleness and patience. And you also can light the world with deeds of mercy. Deeds of mercy. The Bible says mercy triumphs over judgment. So what does that look like? Well, here's what this means. When it is within your power to repay an offense with an offense, when it is within your power, your right, to repay an insult with an insult, when it is within your power to get even, don't get even. Show mercy. And here's why. There's two reasons. First, it's because you're going to need God's mercy again in the future. And the Bible says God shows us mercy the way we show mercy to other people. But the other reason to show mercy, think about this. Which do you think is more likely to lead a person, to cause a person, to come to Jesus Christ, getting even with them or showing them mercy? Jesus said in Matthew 544, love your enemies and pray for those who hurt you. He says you pray for them. Now, that doesn't mean that you pray they'll get a flat tire and wind up in a ditch, okay? He says pray for them the way you want to be prayed for. Pray that God will bless them the way you want to be blessed. If they don't know Jesus, pray that they find him, that they meet him, that they give their lives to him. Pray for whatever pain or brokenness is going on in their life that is causing them to be unkind. He says don't hate them, don't speak evil of them, love them and pray for them. And you can also light the world with deeds of generosity. Deeds of generosity. The Lord gives to you so that he can give through you. God doesn't want you to hoard. He wants you to live with open hands. He doesn't make money just fall miraculously from the sky. He gives to us so that he can provide through us to people who are in need. God is a generous God and he wants us to learn to be generous as well. The Bible says in 1 Timothy 6, command God's people to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. Now you can also light the world through deeds of selflessness. Selflessness of putting other people first, of living sacrificially. The Bible says in Romans 12, love one another with brotherly affection, giving precedence and showing honor to one another. So deeds of compassion, deeds of mercy, deeds of generosity, deeds of selflessness. This is why the peace plan is so important here at Saddleback. It's all about salting the earth with words of grace and lighting the world through deeds of grace. It's showing people how much we care so that they will then want to know what is the reason that you have so much hope. But get this, you cannot eliminate darkness with salt. You can't just sit there and talk about the darkness and say, oh, it's so horribly dark over there. It's so horribly dark in our culture. It's so horribly dark. We're just going to, let's just hide over here and talk about it until the darkness goes away. That's not going to do anything. Instead, you just turn on the light through deeds of grace. Turn on the lights. We have to shine our lights, as Jesus said, like a city on a hill so people will see the difference in our lives. They'll give glory to God and find their way to Jesus. They'll find their way home. And we can't do that if we are hiding behind the walls of a church. Stockpiled salt and hidden light are useless. The church, you know this, the church is not a building. It's people. And it's people who are doing God's work in God's way in the world that God loves. Did you know that God does not hate the world? He loves the world. That's what John 3, 16 is all about. God so loved the world that he gave his only son to die for it. God does not hate the world. He loves the world. He loves the ways of the world, the people of the world. And he wants to love the world through you. And God is not afraid of unbelievers. You don't have to be afraid of them either. I've known people who just want nothing to do with people that don't know Jesus. They just want to get them out of their life and have nothing to do with them. They're afraid of it. You don't have to be afraid of unbelievers. And that's what the Bible says about that. Again, it's in 1 Peter 2. It's here on the screen. Peter says, Dear brothers, you're only visitors here. And since your real home is in heaven, I beg you to keep away from the evil people of the world. Is that what that says? Is that what that says? No. That's not what that says. He does not say keep away from the evil people of the world. He says, I beg you to keep away from the evil pleasures of the world. The evil pleasures. Not all pleasures are evil. Stay away from the evil pleasures of the world. They're not for you because they fight against your very soul. Instead, he says, be careful how you behave among, not apart from, not hidden from. Be careful how you behave among your unsaved neighbors. For then, even if they're suspicious of you and talk against you, they will end up praising God for your good works when Christ returns. So you don't have to be afraid of the world. God is not afraid of the world. He loves the world. And he wants to love the world through you. Through your life-changing conversations. No matter when they happen, no matter how they start, even if it's do you brush your teeth."}]}

{"timestamp": 10240, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2085, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER SEVEN\n RULE #2\n Be Still So You Can Heal (The Neutral Spine)\n From Jeremy\nLet\u2019s assume that you are beginning to get the big picture. And that you have also begun to identify the \u201cdumb\u201d things that you\u2019ve been doing to wreck your back, and that you have stopped doing them. Good. Now it is time to start the healing, and that is a matter of immobilizing your lower back or lumbar spine so it can heal, after all those years of doing things that hurt it. \nThe analogy is not perfect, but think of your tortured back as being like a broken arm or leg. When you break an arm, say, the doc puts it in a stiff cast so you can\u2019t bang it or twist it and to give it time and rest to heal. The same with your back, except we can\u2019t do anything quite as dramatic as put you in a whole-body cast for your damaged back. What we can do is show you how to carry yourself so that you effectively immobilize your lower back. It\u2019s not totally easy, but it will work. And bear in mind, if you do not immobilize your back, it will not heal\u2014simple as that. Indeed, it may get worse. \nWhat do I mean by \u201cimmobilizing\u201d your lumbar spine? I do not mean that you can\u2019t sit or walk or have a more or less normal life. What I do mean is that you have to be really serious about maintaining a neutral spine, all the time. Maintaining a neutral spine is at the heart of your cure, and will be at the heart of your life after your cure. This is the time to learn how to achieve a neutral spine and how to maintain it all the time, even when doing various movements. \nThe spine is a meticulously engineered piece of machinery, but it has a lot of redundancy built in. By this I mean that unlike the knee or shoulder, in the spine when you have a bad joint, the surrounding structures can \u201chelp\u201d bear the loads, and you can function more or less normally and without pain. Take the pressure of bad posture\u2014and dumb movement patterns\u2014off, and there is very likely enough \u201croom\u201d in this spine for the sufferer to have a normal life. For example, the \u201choles\u201d where the nerves come out of the spine (the foramina) are still big enough for the nerves to exit, pain-free, if you\u2019re not squeezing the area with lousy posture. In the same vein, there is probably still enough cushion in the flattened disc to support a correctly aligned spine (but not a bent or misshapen one). And so on. \n\u201cNeutral\u201d means the position in which the least amount of problem loads occur, all up and down the spine. The \u201cproblem loads\u201d in some pictures we\u2019ve shown are extreme, but even those inflamed joints and nerve roots will likely calm down if you leave them alone for a while. Which is to say, if you keep your spine in neutral. As bad as those injuries are (and as long as it took someone to create them) there is a strong chance that that sufferer can go about his or her life, with a neutral spine, in little or no pain. \nLearning to keep a neutral spine is not totally easy. And learning to maintain it all the time is harder. But this is the \u201ccast\u201d that lets your body heal. It is worth going to a lot of trouble to get this right. And it is a lesson that you will use for the rest of your life, long after the problem area has \u201chealed.\u201d \nOkay, step one is understanding the concept of neutral spine. Step two is learning to find it and lock it in place, and keep it in place forever (which we will teach you in Chapter 9).\nThe neutral spine is the position that allows your spine to do its job with the least amount of stress and load. And\u2014if you have already damaged your back\u2014it is the position that results in the least amount of new damage or pain.\nFor most people, the picture on the left is the neutral spine. The other two are not.\nNeutral Spine \n\nGOOD BAD\nNote the gentle curve of the lower back in the \u201cgood\u201d spine. For the majority of you, this is how your neutral spine will look. If you have developed significant degenerative changes or were born with significant abnormalities (it happens, but not a lot), your neutral spine may look a bit different. For now assume that your neutral spine looks like one on the guy on the left. Spines vary, and you may have your own unique neutral spine that is a little different from this. Whatever your own neutral spine, that is the position you want to maintain as you go about your daily life. It is also the position in which you feel the least pain. Again, maintaining a neutral spine is a fundamental behavioral change for most people. And it is readily doable. In a few months\u2019 time, I predict that it will be natural and you will scarcely need to think about it. One of the near-magic presences in our lives is \u201cmuscle memory.\u201d Maintain your spine correctly for a while and muscle memory takes over. Then it is just a question of seeing to it that your muscles are strong enough to do their job. \nHow do you keep your spine neutral and still be a dynamic, moving, active human being? By learning to brace your neutral spine with your core (Chapter 9) and maximizing movement in your hips (as opposed to your lower back). As Chris mentioned in Chapter 6, one of our cardinal rules is \u201cThou shalt not bend or twist with thy lower back.\u201d And you don\u2019t need to. You can rotate from side to side and bend forward and back using your hips. You do not need to flex or twist your lower back. \nYou may ask: Isn\u2019t range of motion important for the lumbar spine? Answer: Not really. At least, it is usually the least important factor for someone who has had significant back pain, and should be reintroduced only after pain has stopped. Most people who have experienced regular, serious back pain have already sustained significant wear and tear on the spine. The general pattern I see is a combination of two things: first, worn-down vertebral joints that are hypomobile (stiff), secondary to arthritic changes and degeneration; second, lumbar vertebral joints that are hypermobilie (loose), due to overstretched ligaments and atrophied muscles. These problems are best resolved when we protect the spine by bracing and \u201clocking down\u201d the lumbar spine and moving in a manner that completely changes the axis of motion from the lumbar spine to the hips and shoulder girdle. You can eventually introduce some gentle lumbar range-of-motion exercises in non-loaded ways. This is what the \u201cCat/Camel\u201d exercise that we introduce later is for. Small, gentle lumbar range-of-motion exercise is necessary for things like synovial joint lubrication, the reduction of friction between vertebral segments and discs, and disc nutrition, among other things. For example, walking requires a few degrees of freedom between the lumbar vertebral joints (3 or 4 degrees rotation) with coordinated muscle contractions to enhance stabilization and supply necessary lubrication and nutrition to discs and joints. For our purposes, we recommend keeping lumbar motion to a minimum, especially until your pain is gone. Once that occurs, you should make only healthy, non-loaded, non-repetitive lumbar movements, such as those necessary for walking and the cat and camel exercise. Spinal stability, core endurance, hip mobility, and core and gluteal strength are far more important for maintaining a healthy spine once you\u2019ve had back pain. You can do just fine in life with almost no rotation or excessive movement in your lower back. Let your hips do the work, and your risk of recurring back pain is sharply reduced. \nFinding Your Neutral Spine \nFinding your neutral spine can be a bit tricky for some but you can do it. Here\u2019s what you do. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Try to relax everything in your body, and just breathe. Then let\u2019s start by performing a pelvic tilt. \nTo do that, flatten your lower back into the floor (see top drawing), and curl your tailbone upward. This is a \u201cposterior pelvic tilt,\u201d if you want to put a name to it. Now, arch your back so that your lower back comes off of the floor (middle drawing), and point your tailbone toward the ground (an \u201canterior pelvic tilt\u201d). Now, slowly go back and forth between those two motions a few times (bottom drawing). Find the position of your lower back between these two extremes (flattening your back or arching it) that feels the most comfortable to you, and stop there. This is your neutral spine. It may take a few tries but it\u2019s not hard.\nFinding Your Neutral Spine\n\nStop here for a second. You have just reached an important point, and you don\u2019t want to \u201close\u201d it. Everyone\u2019s neutral spine is a bit different depending on the anatomical condition of their lumbar spine. For most people, there will be a gentle curve in the lower back. For those who already have some kind of a disc bulge, their neutral spine might be more arched (butt more extended). For those with spinal stenosis, their neutral spine may be a little more flattened than the one in the picture on the previous page. Don\u2019t worry about it. Whatever feels the most comfortable for you is your neutral spine for now. In time, your neutral spine will likely become more like the \u201cnormal\u201d picture as pain and inflammation subside.\nThink about your neutral spine and assume that position all the time until it becomes second nature\u2014until \u201cmuscle memory\u201d takes over. \nNext, we move on to a discussion of techniques to help you maintain a neutral spine. But first, Chris is going to tell you why it is very likely you haven\u2019t heard of these concepts before."}]}
{"timestamp": 10249, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2391, "Output Length": 12, "prompt": "Business RFP\nFinancial Rationale\nThe financials of the business RFP\u2019s that we received were subdivided and calculated in\nthree parts, first by sleeping room requirements, second by meeting room requirements, and third\nby food and beverage needs. The initial needs of the group were calculated and then services fees\nand taxes were included to give a rough estimation on the Grand Total of the event.\nFigure 1 represents the corporate sleeping room needs. The peak number of room nights\nand total room nights were taken directly from the provided RFP\u2019s, if attrition was not disclosed\nin the RFP we assumed 90% as the standard, however, attrition is a negotiable point if we\ndecided to move forward with the RFP.\nThe Standard Rate was based on the standard rate offered by the hotel for those dates\nfound on Hyatt\u2019s website, and the sleeping room subtotal was determined by multiplying the\nstandard rate by the total room nights. For the group ACC the standard rate is for accomodations\nin Hyatt House, since the group is made up of board members and sponsors we assumed the best\naccommodations would be in the king bedrooms in the Hyatt House and a standard upgrade\nwould be a studio room. For the client we refer to as \u201cHi Kim\u201d we chose Hyatt Place due to the\nvolume of room nights, and the need for both double and single occupancy rooms which Hyatt\nHouse does not offer. Global Cynergies\u2019 client budgeted $150 per room so we placed them in\nHyatt Place and are able to stay below budget once the group rate discount is applied.\nThe room block discount is set at a standard 15% for all groups. However, this is\nsomething that would be up for negotiation later on. The Group Rate Subtotal is the sleeping\nroom total after the discount has been applied and Total is the final price for sleeping room\naccomodations after sales and accommodations tax are applied (both rates are set by the SC\nDepartment of Revenue). Once the total has been summed up we divided it by the total number\nof room nights to receive the average per person.\nFigure 1\nFigure 2 demonstrates the breakdown for meeting space cost. The meeting space chosen\nis based on the amount of attendees of the event. More detail on meeting and food and beverage\nspecs can be found in the BRM\u2019s in the appendix.\nThe meeting room rates were pulled from the rates on the Sterling Hall cost sheet for\nHyatt House/Place, and then this rate is multiplied by the number of days that the room will be\nreserved and totaled with the combined meeting space required. For example, ACC will need the\nentire Magnolia Ballroom for an 85 person annual meeting. The whole ballroom will be used but\ndivided into two sections. Two of the three sections will be used for the meeting space in banquet\nstyle, and the other third will be divided by a wall and hold the breakfast and lunch buffets that\nguest can then take back to their seats. This gives the client the separation between meeting\nspace and food spreads they requested, and it allows the banquet staff to transition from one meal\nto the next, set-up and clean without disrupting the meeting. This same formula was used for \u201cHi\nKim\u201d and Global Cynergies, elaborating on what room style would best suit the meeting function\nand finding the appropriately sized space, if there was a time where we were just over the max\ncapacity we always opted for a larger room.\nOnce the subtotal for the room space rental was determined additional service fees were\napplied. The exhibit charge did not apply to any of our RFP\u2019s so it always rang up to zero. The\nhotel service fee comes from the Sterling Hall packet from Hyatt which states that 22% is the\nHotel administrative fee and that all prices and services are subject to this charge. The room\nrental and audio/visual tax rate is 9% as stated in the Sterling Hall packet from Hyatt, and wifi is\noffered complimentary to guests in both their sleeping and meeting rooms. The summation of\nthese taxes and fees with the subtotal of the room rental gives the cost estimation of the meeting\nspace.\nFigure 2\nHyatt can make a profit in addition to sleeping and meeting rooms on food and beverage\noffered during meetings. By adding food and alcohol services Hyatt can require a servers per an\namount of people. For example, the price for a bartender is $125.00 for the first two hours and\neach hour after is an additional $30.00. A bartender is required for every 70 people. Therefore,\nan event that requires a cocktail hour reception can be huge profit for Hyatt.\nA major factor we considered when selecting the RFPs was the ratio between guests and\nsleeping rooms. The amount of sleeping rooms each client needed to the meeting space they take\nup is in correlation to price and profit. For example, \" Hi Kim\" brings in 136 total room nights, 10\ntotal uses of meeting space and $20,530.60 in food. Food and beverage is another profit making\nservice that Hyatt can provided guests.\nFigure 3\nProduct- Market Match\nACC\nThe Association of Corporate Counsel Chapter Annual Meeting is an event that is for a\ngroup based out of Columbia, SC and hosts about 75-100 guests from throughout the state.\nPrevious hosts have both been in Columbia, South Carolina.\nSince the group is already from South Carolina the\nseasonality is not something that will sway their choice to\ncome here, the weather for Charleston in September is\nsomething they are accustomed to and the rate for this time\nof year is comparable to rates you would receive in\nColumbia. Because this corporation and the attendees are\nfrom the state it will be easy to sell them on the destination\nof Charleston because, it is a departure from where the event\nwas the last two years and the meeting will still be in-state but will provide new opportunities.\nThe amount of rooms and meeting space they are requesting is reasonable, especially\nbecause it is taking place in a month that is hard to sell. ACC would take up 21% of Hyatt Place\nsleeping rooms, and occupy 25% of the meeting rooms over the course of the stay cumulatively\n(shown in Figure A ). This presents about a 1:1 ratio for sleeping rooms to meeting rooms. This\ngroup is coming on shoulder nights (Sunday-Tuesday) and during the hot summer months, when\nsales are low. This is a good ratio because it leaves plenty of empty space in the combined Hyatt\nHouse/Place to sell to additional corporate groups, and enough meeting space as well. The group\nwill also require catering and A/V needs, the A/V needs will provide a high margin along with\nthe sleeping rooms that is attractive.\nBecause ACC wanted to book their visit during the low season we extend the offer of the\ngroup rate three days post which carry into the weekend. We assumed most will decide not to\nstay, but those that do will give us valuable room nights for September weekdays.\nThe group is one we highly considered because the RFP language is clear and concise, it\nis easy to read and the group appears like they will be easy to plan with since they have a vision\nfor what they want for layout and itinerary.\n\"Hi Kim\"\nThe most important note to make on the group we refer to as \u201cHi Kim\u201d is they are second-hold\nfor these same dates. They are great business opportunity but\nthere is another group currently in negotiations for the same\nweekend that- we assume- requires similar needs as this group\nwhich would not allow both groups to book at Hyatt.\nThe group \u201cHi Kim\u201d is coming during the high season of\nCharleston, near the end of May, and does not include their\nmeeting history or information about their group. Based on the\nfamiliarity in the RFP letter we assume this group is familiar\nwith Charleston and the prices they generally requested of\ngroups, especially in May, and the group is aware they are on\nhold but is still eager to come visit so they would be a group\neasy to sell to and negotiate with.\nThe group requires 136 room nights in Hyatt Place, 24% of the hotel\u2019s sleeping rooms,\nand 31% of the cumulative meeting rooms (shown in Figure B ). The rooms ratio is close to 1:1\nfor sleeping rooms to meeting rooms. The group would be occupy a large portion of the hotel\u2019s\nsleeping roms cumulatively. This is a large amount of sleeping room to occupy for the high\nseason with a low amount of sleeping rooms. Given that the time of the stay is during\nCharleston\u2019s high season, a group with a 1:1 ratio is very practical, especially given high amount\nof leisure travelers.\nThe group \u201cHi Kim\u201d would need substantial A/V, and food & beverage needs, the A/V\nwould provide high margins however, food & beverage is not one of the better profit drivers for\nthe hotel. Since another piece of business is already on the books for this time of year we did not\noffer them a proposal. However, this is a group that we would like to build a relationship with\nand suggest booking with us at a later date.\nGlobal Cynergies\u2019 Client\nGlobal Cynergies is a third party representing an unnamed client. The meeting is for a small\ngroup of young corporate marketing leaders looking for a destination with fun restaurants and activities\nnearby. This is the first time the meeting is being held. The group is considering Nashville, Asheville, and\nAdairsville as other options, all comparable to Charleston in one way or another but lacking the whole\npackage that only Charleston can offer. The group would be a\ngood match for the Charleston Hyatt because the area is\nsurrounding is youth-centric, there\u2019s an endless supply of bars\nand restaurants for anyone\u2019s taste, all a walkable distance\nfrom the hotel, including the Pour Taproom on top of the\nH yatt. Even though this group is comprised of only 12\npeople, it is a young group and they are a marketing\nleadership team, hinting that there is potential for the\nteam/company will grow and become a repeat client.\nThe group wants to come on shoulder nights in\nAugust, which are generally hard to fill nights in a low\nseason for Charleston, these dates would be a nice piece\nof business to bring in and fill late summer holes. The group has 24 total room nights in the\nHyatt Place, taking up a total of 6% of the hotel\u2019s sleeping rooms but they require 3 full days of\nmeeting space in the Carolina room equaling about 8% of meeting rooms, (shown in Figure C ).\nThis is about a 1:1 ratio of sleeping rooms to meeting rooms, but still a large percentage of\nmeeting rooms and sleeping rooms would remain open. The hotel will have plenty of sleeping\nrooms to provide to leisure travelers and the meeting space they are occupying will be fairly\ninconsequential if other groups require meeting space at the same time.\nThe group will also provide a high profit margin because they need rooms and A/V\nrequirements, and they will also require food & beverages throughout the whole day of their\nmeetings charged per consumption."}]}

{"timestamp": 10329, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1406, "Output Length": 11, "prompt": "I confess, with only a touch of embarrassment, that I had no idea until we started working on this book that each vertebra was really a two-part bone. There is the more or less solid and weight-bearing portion toward your front, called \u201cthe vertebral body\u201d (with the discs in between). And then there\u2019s this flying buttress\u2013looking piece that sticks off the back (the \u201cvertebral arch\u201d). And there is a very important space between the two sections. The \u201chollow\u201d down the middle of your spine is really a space between these two segments of the vertebra. The vertebra is one solid piece of bone but with two very distinct segments and a hole down the middle where the spinal cord goes. \nThe Spinal Column\n\nDo you see the spiny-looking pieces in the picture, above, sticking off the vertebrae? Those are pieces of the vertebral arch. They are called \u201cthe spinous processes\u201d (no one cares), and they are basically anchor points. That\u2019s where ligaments can attach muscles to the vertebrae. If you\u2019re a sailor, think of cleats on the deck, for ropes. When you reach back and feel the spiny part of your back, you\u2019re feeling the \u201cspinous processes\u201d or the cleats. By the way, the ligaments or sinews are the lines (think \u201cstays\u201d on a sailboat) that hold your spine erect. Without stays, the mast on a sailboat would flop around and break in no time; with stays, the mast on a well-designed sailboat is remarkably stable. Flexible, like your spine, but stable and strong, too. \nOkeydoke, on to the discs. This is familiar territory to most of us. You hear about discs all the time. \u201cBulging discs,\u201d \u201cpinched discs,\u201d \u201cslipped discs,\u201d \u201cruptured discs\u201d and so on. They are basically washers to keep the weight-bearing parts of the vertebrae from rubbing on one another and to put some \u201cgive\u201d into your back. You cannot have an articulated stack of bones without a wonderfully effective stack of washers to keep \u2019em apart, and you do. Think of them as very tough jelly doughnuts, as I mentioned before. There is a tough, fibrous layer on the outside and a gooey or liquid core on the inside. They act as shock absorbers and have a lot to do with letting you bend. Dysfunctional discs can be a major source of problems and pain. \nA YOUNG PERSON\u2019S PROBLEMS\nThis is interesting. Bulging and actually ruptured discs are mostly a young person\u2019s problem, people in their thirties (and you kids are welcome to them; they really hurt). Older people have horrendous problems, too; after all, some 35 percent of people from ages forty-five to sixty-five have serious back pain. But usually not this particular horror. Which also means that more younger people are going to get bundled off to the surgeon, if the problem is grim enough. Older people have disc problems, too, but nowhere near as often. \nTake a long look at the pictures on the next pages. They show you how the spinal cord, spine, and discs work together. First is a side view depicting how the brain, spinal cord, and spine are positioned in the body. Second is a close-up of a segment made up of two vertebrae with their disc (in gray) in between and the spinal cord and nerve roots visible. Notice how the rear parts of the adjoining vertebrae form a canal through which the spinal cord runs from top to bottom. Also notice how the two adjoining vertebrae form holes, or \u201cforamina,\u201d on the sides where the nerve roots come out of the spine. Those holes are super-important: The holes can become smaller from disc degeneration or movement of the vertebrae on top of each other. And the nerve that comes out of the hole is pressured, and it hurts like blazes. Not to get too scary, but when things really go to hell and you actually rupture or split the disc open with your ridiculous posture or whatnot, the pain really goes over the top. (Good news: You hear about ruptured discs all the time, but they are comparatively rare.) Bones wear on bones, discs hurt like crazy, and the stuff in the middle squirts all over the place. Which is bad because it causes severe chemical pain in the nerves. Not so good. When we say that there are times when traditional medicine (surgery) has a critical role, this is one of them. \nNote the bits of bone to the left in the close-up side view vertebral segment. These are \u201cthe facet joints.\u201d The point of this picture is to show how they are right next to the spinal cord and near one of the nerve exit spots. They are well placed, in other words, to raise hell if things go wrong with them. I forgot to mention this: The surfaces of the facet joints are covered in cartilage, which allows smooth movement in a healthy spine. So what? The point is that this cartilage can be abraded or torn by dumb moves, too, and that hurts as well. \nHere are two more views, below. Note the sort of circular thing with the lighter insides. That\u2019s a cross section of a disc, seen from the top. \n\nLigaments and Tendons\nAll right, that\u2018s the spinal cord and the spinal column. But they would not stand alone without a ton of support. Think of the spinal column as a slender reed. If you press down on it at all from above (or the sides), it will bend crazily. Indeed, it cannot sustain any weight at all to speak of. But now, add a bunch of support lines from the pole to a solid support, and it\u2019s a different story. Our backbone has a lot of very sturdy support lines called ligaments and tendons (ligaments connect bone to bone; tendons connect bone to muscle.) There are an awful lot of ligaments connected to the spine. The following picture gives you the idea. \nHere\u2019s another thing you need to know: Ligaments can become deformed or sprained because of bad posture, a persistent pattern of bad movements, or an injury. When that happens to a ligament, the joints those ligaments were supporting \u201cget loose\u201d and can slip around. That is really bad. Here is a language alert: A \u201csprain\u201d is an unhealthy stretch or tear of a ligament, and a \u201cstrain\u201d is an unhealthy stretch or tear in a tendon or muscle. Look at the picture on the opposite page: there are a ton of ligaments here, all waiting to go haywire if you are foolish or unlucky. \nSpinal Ligaments"}]}

Over the past two decades it has become increasingly involved, whether this relates to outright purchases (and more recently disposals), or in terms of using gold to help boost commercial bank liquidity.\n\nGold Reserves\nIn Turkey, the CBRT\u2019s core activities, in terms of its management of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, are guided by Article 53 of the CBRT Law. Specifically for gold, this governs how the Bank may execute forward and/ or spot purchases and sales of gold and lending/borrowing transactions.\n\nUntil September 2011, the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves (as reported to the IMF) had remained essentially flat at 116.1t. Since then, its gross holdings have risen sharply, to reach 716.3t by end-2020. The increase largely reflects the adoption of more gold friendly policies by the Turkish government, which has increasingly promoted the role of gold in the financial system, while at the same time trying to lessen the country\u2019s dependence on the dollar. To help achieve these goals, aside from the CBRT making direct gold purchases from local and international markets, it has increasingly used other tools, including the Gold Monetisation Scheme, the Treasury\u2019s gold bond and gold lease certificate issuances and the CBRT\u2019s gold swaps programme with local commercial banks.\n\n1. CBRT\u2019s Own Reserves\nFocussing on the CBRT\u2019s own reserves, it was not until May 2017 that the central bank started to raise its holdings. In other words, the 320t increase in the CBRT\u2019s gross holdings between October 2011 and April 2017 was driven by the commercial banks\u2019 gold held through the reserve option mechanism (ROM).\n\nFrom 115.8t in April 2017, the CBRT\u2019s own holdings peaked at 440.6t in July 2020. This was followed by a period of disposals during August-December which totalled over 105t, these accounting for the largest share of global central bank sales at that time. This left the CBRT\u2019s own reserves at 334.7t by end-2020. These sales were largely driven by a deteriorating economic backdrop and currency crisis. After Turkish foreign exchange reserves dropped to a multi-decade low over the summer, some gold holdings are believed to have been mobilised to support the lira and/or repay international debt.\n\n2. Treasury\nPart of the growth in the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves also reflected the issuance of gold bonds and lease certificates by the Turkish Treasury, as gold collected via these programmes was transferred to the central bank\u2019s account. In September 2017, the Treasury decided to issue both an interest-bearing gold bond and also a gold sukuk (the Islamic equivalent of a bond, generating a return while still being compliant under Sharia law). Both were sold to the public in return for their physical gold.\n\nUnder this mechanism the public deposited their gold with the state-owned Ziraat Bank and, in return, the Treasury issued a gold bond or sukuk, both of which pay dividends in Turkish lira (TL) at regular intervals. At the point of maturity, investors have had two options. First, they can take back their gold in the form of Republic coins struck by the State Mint, Darphane. Alternatively, these instruments can be sold back before maturity to the Treasury with payment made in TL. Starting with a volume of 1.9t in October 2017 and, with the subsequent involvement of financial institutions, the total amount of these two instruments reached 60t by the end of 2020; with further auctions in 2021 boosting this figure to 94.7t by end-June 2021.\n\nCBRT\u2019s Gross Gold Holdings, by Location (1)\n\nSource: CBRT Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020\n1. All holdings are taken from the CBRT\u2019s Annual Financial Statements without any adjustment\n\n2. The reported CBRT\u2019s own gold includes gold swap with non-official entities. This explains why end-year figure in this table is higher than Metals Focus\u2019 estimate (334.7t at end-2020)\n\n3. Under the Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\n\n3. Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\nThe reserve option mechanism (ROM) has its roots in gold banking\u2019s evolution in Turkey. For many years, this was a niche area in the Turkish financial sector, with only one bank working on Islamic finance principles, Kuveyt Turk Kat\u0131l\u0131m Bankas\u0131, which introduced the first gold account in Turkey. However, there was little other commercial bank involvement until the CBRT started its gold monetisation scheme in 2012 through the ROM. This was first introduced in 2011 and its purpose was communicated by the CBRT as to limit the negative effects of excessive volatility of capital flows on the country\u2019s macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as also boosting the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves.\n\nAfter the gold monetisation scheme was launched, banks started to use the ROM more effectively. Simply put, as part of the ROM banks are allowed to hold a certain ratio of Turkish lira reserve requirements as foreign exchange and/or gold in increasing tranches. This affords an opportunity to use gold as a tool to create more room for lira credit lines. As a result, gold collected through the country\u2019s gold monetisation scheme and through gold banking accounts (offered by Turkish commercial banks) are channelled towards this use.\n\nIn terms of how the ROM applies to gold; since end-2012 and until 3rd October 2016, a maximum of 30% (known as the reserve option coefficient, ROC) of a bank\u2019s reserve liabilities could be offset against gold. This 30% was broken down into three tranches, each involving a different reserve option ratio. For the first 20% bracket, the ratio was set at 1.2, which meant that, for example, TL1.2m of gold was required to free up TL1m of Turkish Lira (TL) reserves. For the next 5% bracket, the ratio rose to 1.7, and for the last 5% the ratio stands at 2.2. The value of the gold is marked-to-market every 15 days.\n\nA new incentive announced by the CBRT on September 1, 2016 defined a further tranche of 5%, in addition to the existing 30% facility. This 5% also featured two new elements. First, it allowed only bullion refined from scrap gold collected by banks from the public after October 3, 2016 to be utilised, and excluded all other bullion from other sources.\n\nSecond, the reserve option ratio will be set to 1, which means there is a one-to-one conversion towards the ROC. The lower ROC suggests that banks will now be incentivised to attract consumer-held gold stocks since other forms of gold, such as metal acquired via electronic purchases, will not qualify.\n\nThis ruling was then amended on 18th January 2020, with the 30% ceiling reduced to 20%. On 24th February 2021, this was again reduced, this time to 15% and the scrap gold related tranche, which was first introduced as 5% and raised to 10% on 16th February 2019, has been further increased to 15%. Under this scheme, commercial banks have been allowed to use gold against a portion of their reserve liabilities. In turn, this encouraged banks to start gold collection days where they bought back gold from the public. Beforehand, gold deposit accounts did not pay interest, but it then became more common to do so, with interest rates peaking at around 2.4% by mid-2018. However, this trend then reversed. Today, interest can range from as low as 0.15% up to 1%, with some commercial banks offering interest-free gold bank accounts. This change reflects the increased reserve requirement ratios, which by 19th November 2020, stood at 18% for maturities of at least one-year and at 22% for lower maturity dates, depending on the bank in question. Furthermore, investor returns are subject to a 15% withholding tax for account holders over a minimum term starting from three to six months.\n\n4. Gold Swaps\nIn May 2019, the CBRT started to use gold swaps as another tool to regulate money supply and manage foreign exchange reserves. Under this new policy, commercial banks can swap a portion of their gold holdings with the CBRT in return for lira and foreign currency or vice versa. Gold swapped under this route will be transferred to the CBRT\u2019s account. To put this new policy into perspective, from 12.3t in May 2019, the total amount of gold swap jumped to 123.5t by end-2020. Summarize as points with headings"}]}

Although the parts of the anxiety buffering system are often inter-related, they may still offer slightly other means for terror management. However, when more than one of these anxiety buffers are malfunctioning, people are left defenseless against death-related thoughts and anxiety, which might lead to feelings of helplessness and depression (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012, Mikulincer et al., 2020). Psychopathology might then arise when early childhood problems, traumatic events, or other disruptive life changes increase the level of threat and potential for debilitating anxiety, which requires the normal functioning of the anxiety buffering system. Thus, from the ABDT perspective, low self-esteem, attachment security, and connection to the cultural worldview are a transdiagnostic contributors to mental disorders (Yetzer & Pyszczynski, 2019). Importantly, understanding the pivotal (and yet dynamic) role that self-esteem plays in the anxiety buffering system may allow psychologists to better treat psychological disorders related to anxiety. \n \n \nSelf-Esteem and Immortality \n \nAs we noted in the beginning of this chapter, from the TMT perspective, a central but rather implicit part of self-esteem is the feeling that one is worthy of protection and immortality. Many studies have found that, in line with TMT, believing that one will enjoy modes of literal or symbolic immortality is associated with lower levels of death anxiety and defensiveness in response to reminders of death (e.g., Dechesne et al., 2003; Florian, & Mikulincer, 1998b; Wojtkowiak & Rutjens, 2011). In addition, there are studies showing that MS increases peoples\u2019 motivation for obtaining symbolic immortality (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2010), and that affirming people\u2019s symbolic legacy or literal immortality beliefs reduces DTA and defensiveness in response to MS (e.g., Dechesne et al., 2003; Wojtkowiak & Rutjens, 2011). Thus, immortality beliefs seem to function as death anxiety buffers, as selfesteem does. \nHowever, it is only recently that research has directly assessed whether self-esteem affords people a sense of symbolic immortality. Specifically, Lifshin et al. (2021) conducted several large-scale correlational studies with American college students, in which they included measures of self-esteem (either a short 1-item measure of selfesteem, or the 10-item Rosenberg self-esteem scale), and several measures of symbolic immortality (e.g., \u201cDo you think that you will be remembered by other people after you die [e.g., through your \naccomplishments or legacy]?\u201d; \u201cAfter I die, my impact on the world will continue and be remembered by others\u201d). The researchers also included a measure assessing the participants\u2019 belief that they may enjoy literal immortality (\u201cDo you think that you will live again after you die [e.g., in heaven or through reincarnation?]\u201d), as well as other measures related to terror management and self-esteem such as: in-group identification, loneliness, existential isolation, attachment insecurities, perceived meaning in life, DTA, and depression. \nIn line with the TMT of self-esteem, findings across seven samples indicated that self-esteem was consistently related to believing that one would be remembered and have an impact after they die. Furthermore, this relationship remained strong after statistically controlling for the participants\u2019 levels of loneliness (social connectedness), attachment insecurities, and perceived meaning in life (which were all related to both symbolic immortality and to self-esteem), as well as other variables. This point is important because the findings eliminate these other variables as alternative reasons for why self-esteem predicts belief in one\u2019s symbolic immortality, for example the idea that self-esteem just does so by increasing a sense of social connection. \nFindings from this research also supported the self-esteem and immortality hypothesis regarding literal immortality, although this relationship was weaker than the one between self-esteem and symbolic immortality. Unlike with symbolic immortality, however, self-esteem was only significantly related to a greater sense of literal immortality among participants who believe that an afterlife exists (not among those who do not). \nFinally, the authors conducted mediational analyses showing that participants\u2019 sense of symbolic immortality partially mediated the effect of self-esteem on DTA and depression, as higher levels of self-esteem were associated with higher beliefs in symbolic immortality, which in turn was negatively associated with both DTA and depression. The finding that this mediational effect was only partial suggests that the selfesteem may buffer against death awareness by both providing a more \n\u201cdirect\u201d solution to death (i.e., belief in symbolic immortality) or though raising the degree to which people feel protected more generally. \nThe findings from Lifshin et al. (2021) suggest that feelings of symbolic immortality (or lack thereof) may be an important aspect of self-esteem and the death-anxiety buffering system. However, because these studies were correlational in nature, additional experimental or perhaps longitudinal research is needed to provide stronger support for the notion that higher/lower levels of self-esteem cause higher/lower levels of symbolic immortality. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nIn this chapter we have presented the terror management theory (Greenberg et al. 1986) of self-esteem, which posits that self-esteem functions as a protective psychological resource, shielding people from anxiety in general, as well as from the specific potential for debilitating anxiety resulting from the awareness of mortality. Research reviewed throughout this chapter has supported this terror management function of self-esteem by showing that (1) reminders of death increase self-esteem striving, (2) self-esteem reduces defensiveness, anxiety, and death-related thought in response to reminders of mortality, (3) threats to self-esteem increase death-related cognition, (4) low self-esteem is associated with deficient terror management mechanisms and results in death anxiety and risk for psychopathology after trauma, and (5) high self-esteem is associated with a stronger sense of immortality. \nThe role of self-esteem underlying much of human behavior has been a central theme in psychological theorizing (e.g., Crocker & Wolfe, 2001; Horney, 1937; James, 1890; Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Mead, 1934; Rosenberg, 1965; Sullivan, 1953), and psychological research has borne important findings regarding the importance of self-esteem in psychological functioning (e.g., Orth & Robins, 2014). Illuminating the terror management function of self-esteem has had broad implications for understanding, predicting and modifying human thought and behavior, and research within this framework has advanced psychological research in various domains (for reviews, see Routledge & Vess, 2019; Solomon et al., 2015). We should note that although TMT views self-esteem as driven primarily by defensive needs, it does not argue that these needs are the only ones underlying human behavior or self-esteem, and acknowledges the role of other motivations to acquire self-esteem, such as growth and enrichment motives (e.g., Greenberg et al., 1995). Still, given the evidence reviewed, we believe that terror management theory of self-esteem is critical for understanding what self-esteem is and why it matters. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAbeyta, A.

The more attuned a student is to why they\u2019re being tasked with certain assignments, the more their writing will matter, both for them and others.\n \n It also helps if instructors make it clear to students why they\u2019re given certain tasks. College essays stretch a student to practice certain techniques that do transfer, but students rightly become frustrated when this contextual information is not obvious.\n \n III. Audience: Who will help respond to the exigency?\n As with the section on purpose above, audience has a straightforward relation to the exigency: it\u2019s the reader, listener, or viewer whom the author expects to help solve the problem.\n \n This sensitivity to an audience should help students better appreciate why writing programs emphasize the importance of writing for readers. Journaling and some creative writing situations might have an audience of just one (you, the writer), but most rhetorical situations expect the writer to craft their message in such a way that it appeals to a clearly defined audience.\n \n Writing with an intended audience in mind is one of the most important. factors a writer will consider. It impacts everything in a writing course, from the assignments themselves to the peer review process. Although there are many different types of audiences, it can help to lump them into three very broad categories:\n \n Formal communities, such as a college course or professional workplace. Artifacts geared towards these audiences often adhere to highly codified stylistic conventions and are at least somewhat \u201ctight\u201d as a culture.\n Informal communities, such as for friends, family, or social media. Artifacts written for these audiences still follow some rules, but they\u2019re less likely to be explicitly stated. The culture is usually \u201clooser\u201d than academia and professional institutions.\n These communities are defined more carefully below.\n \n Writing within formal communities\n \n When students are expected to simulate expertise on a topic and address a specialized community, they\u2019re writing within a \u201cdiscipline\u201d or \u201cfield of study.\u201d Writing artifacts produced within that field tend to sound the same, circulate within a certain hierarchy, and are housed by specific institutions. The uniqueness of each field of study (a type of context) often fosters academic jargon. You may have noticed that peer-reviewed academic articles look very similar and are more difficult to read than popular news articles. That\u2019s because peer-reviewed articles are published from within and for highly specific writing communities who share a similar vocabulary and disciplinary knowledge with tightly controlled conventions. A contextual appreciation of an article\u2019s audience allows a specialist to say much more about certain things (a molecular biologist can explain the shape of a protein fold very precisely) and less about other things (the same biologist doesn\u2019t need to explain what a protein compound is). Community-as-context helps a writer better understand how to communicate with their intended audience. The cost of this specialization, however, is that peer-reviewed articles can often lapse into too much jargon!\n \n Even when students aren\u2019t expected to simulate expertise, professors often ask them to submit writing samples that adhere to certain conventions, such as MLA or APA Style. In this way, higher education fosters a culture that the cultural psychologist Michele Gelfand would categorize as relatively \u201ctight.\u201d The tightness of academic culture impacts stylistic requirements (MLA, APA, etc.) as well as what \u201cappropriate grammar\u201d looks like.\n \n Part of this tightness helps explain common expectation surrounding \u201cstandard American English\u201d (SAE). Historically, many U.S. academic institutions have penalized deviations from standard English in order to maintain a particular standard that only began to be heavily codified in America in the early nineteenth-century. As a result, variations such as Black English, Spanglish, or sub-dialects related to Southern American English tend to be seen as sub-standard within this broader cultural context that higher education takes for granted (the chapter \u201cStyle and Linguistic Diversity\u201d offers more information about this cultural back-history to standard English). Phrases like \u201cappropriate grammar\u201d should be understood contextually, as belonging to a particular formal culture, even if it\u2019s perceived to be dominant.\n \n Some cultural norms carry over into professional workplace environments, especially formal ones. For example, \u201cclear writing\u201d in the professional world is often conflated with with \u201cIs that written in standard English?\u201d, an expectation that begins in education. On the other hand, MLA or APA formatting are usually not required in many workplace environments, unless it happens to overlap with research or publishing.\n \n Understanding the broader cultural context within which \u201cstylistically appropriate\u201d writing is produced should help a student become even more intentional about the choices they make when writing for the intended audience. It should also lead to more awareness about how to critically evaluate the writing within their community. When participating in peer review, for example, a student who\u2019s aware of the cultural context undergirding requirements such as \u201cappropriate grammar\u201d may adopt a more nuanced tone in their revision feedback.\n \n Writing within informal communities\n \n Depending on a student\u2019s background, the vast quantity of their experience with writing on a daily basis might be for an informal audience, such as a family member, close friends, or significant other. But even very informal writing situations, such as texting a friend, sending an email to a family member, or crafting a social media post place certain expectations on the writer/rhetor. These more informal writing situations may or may not have codes of conduct attached to them. They often appear to emerge spontaneously, as unstated contracts between the parties. Certain unsaid codes of conduct determine what you can and cannot say to a parent vs. a group of friends, for example. However, there tend to be fewer rules governing these situations than the formal writing situations, and they\u2019re usually not articulated anywhere. The rules are almost never explicitly enforced by a governing body or institution. Writers within these situations usually feel spontaneous, natural, and authentic.\n \n The basic distinction between informal and formal writing communities helps explain why college assignments often feel so unnatural and difficult.\n \n IV. Genre\n Genre places additional limits on the rhetor/writer/speaker, beyond those related to the beliefs, concerns, and expectations of the audience.\n \n A genre constraint might be the kind of speech a student is asked to deliver to the class. For example, many COMM 100/101 courses ask students to develop expository and persuasive speeches. When preparing for these assessments, students are often given a set of expectations, including a basic structure, style, and whether certain persuasive appeals are relevant. A student can then adopt a topic of their choice to these default expectations.\n \n This process is not dissimilar from how a maid of honor or best man will google \u201chow to do a maid of honor speech\u201d or \u201chow to do a best man\u2019s speech\u201d before a wedding. There are a well-known set of conventions that people draw from\u2013and, at the same time, cultures and sub-cultures will introduce slight innovations within those recurring forms.\n \n The ability to identify a \u201cpersuasive college speech\u201d or a \u201cbest man\u2019s speech\u201d is both an act of naming and a form of classification. That\u2019s what genre awareness is: an ability to map an assignment or another rhetorical situation to a relatively stable form that recurs across time and space. It\u2019s why the rhetorical term \u201cgenre\u201d is the same as the biological term. They\u2019re both forms of classification. And just as nature evolves, so do li\n[END CHUNK 2/3]\nReply with OK: [CHUNK x/TOTAL], don't reply anything else, don't explain the text!"}]}

You\u2019ll stay awake talking till the sun comes up and not even feel like an hour went by. You\u2019ll hope that every call or text is him/her. You\u2019ll walk through life constantly wondering, \u201cWhat would he/she think about x?\u201d where x is a song, a bird, a walk through the park, a traffic jam, or a colonoscopy.\n\nCall it passion; call it love; call it sickness. The basic traits of your/their personality and your/their slightest behaviors ravage each others\u2019 dopamine receptors in a neurological orgy of starry-eyed dreaminess.\n\nAreas of Chemistry\n\nThe way your partner laughs at your jokes\nThe questions they ask you about your day\nThe way you hold each other in bed\nHow they help you decorate your new apartment\nThe way they smell3\nHow they always ask you for a bite of your burrito and when you say no they take a bite anyways but look so damn cute while doing it you can never bring yourself to feel mad\u2014this is the definition of true love, by the way.\nChemistry is made up of subtle behaviors and dispositions that mesh with behaviors and dispositions of the other person. What\u2019s created is a kind of closed karmic loop in which chemistry is felt by both parties equally. The most important rule about chemistry is that whatever you\u2019re feeling, he or she is most likely feeling the same way. You almost become empaths with one another.\n\nThe artist Alex Grey once said, \u201cTrue love is when two people have pathologies that complement one another.\u201d He was only half-joking.\n\nHigh levels of chemistry usually come from opposite yet complementary qualities in people. A woman who is highly-strung, energetic, and slightly neurotic will tend to have a high degree of chemistry with a guy who is relaxed, mellow, and open. Introverts often have natural chemistry with extroverts. People who are orderly and intense planners sometimes work best with people who are spontaneous and unorganized.\n\nUnlike a lack of compatibility, a lack of chemistry doesn\u2019t repel\u2014it simply results in a lack of emotional intensity. Things just feel kind of dead and boring.\n\nChemistry is also reflected in the bedroom. A lack of chemistry will mean boring, emotionless sex. A high degree of chemistry will mean intense, life-altering, heart-pounding sex that causes your mind to cosmically splatter itself on the walls of your consciousness. Good times.\n\nCompatibility and Chemistry in Relationships\n\n201 PEOPLE HAD BREAKTHROUGHS LAST WEEK. THIS WEEK, WILL ONE OF THEM BE YOU?\nNo spam or unexpected emails. Ever.\n\nHEALTHY AND TOXIC COMBINATIONS OF COMPATIBILITY AND CHEMISTRY\n\nUnfortunately, compatibility and chemistry don\u2019t always occur together.\n\nA relationship with high compatibility but little chemistry is likely to be a boring yet comfortable series of meetings and conversations. It will be a dry and dull affair until both parties simply stop caring and drift apart, or they consummate their mutual convenience by getting married and find themselves in a lifetime of uncomplicated and (often) asexual companionship. Sadly, this arrangement isn\u2019t uncommon.\n\nChemistry without compatibility, on the other hand, usually leads to disaster.4 Sometimes it can be as simple as not living in the same part of the world, but often it\u2019s far more complicated than that.\n\nWhen two people are completely incompatible, their behavior becomes completely irrational. Too often, two incompatible people initiate a cycle of mutual emotional immolation, spiraling through love/hate cycles together at the speed of life.\n\nPeople find themselves saying things like, \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s married to a convicted felon, we\u2019re meant to be together,\u201d or \u201cLook, I know she faked being pregnant to get me to propose to her, but you know, it may just be fate, right?\u201d Meanwhile, friends stare, jaws agape, unsure whether to risk the backlash by trying to snap them out of it or to feign support while their love-blind torture victim pal continues to spin helpless and deluded in a tornado of love.\n\nHigh levels of chemistry with major incompatibilities is bad news. Really bad news.\n\nThese relationships usually begin quickly and passionately, exploding like a geyser, before dying down just as quickly as it erupted. This tends to happen when logic kicks in and when reality makes itself known. Suddenly, you realize how fucking offensive you find each other, but getting out of such a relationship is easier said than done. Your heart says yes, but your head says no. And then you convince your head to say yes, which in turn makes your heart say no.\n\nAt this point, your decision making usually defaults to your genitals\u2014even though their track record for decision making is about as good as a drunk third-grader\u2019s\u2014which only leads to embarrassing public arguments, unpaid drink tabs, thrown iPhones, changed locks, unanswered phone calls, tear-ridden voicemails, and the sterile interior of a clinic, or if you\u2019re lucky, an oh-god-please-don\u2019t-give-me-a-false-positive-you-piece-of-shit-$9.99-pregnancy-test-from-a-7/11 experience, which is guaranteed to challenge anyone\u2019s sanity.\n\nAnd then there you are (wherever you go, as they say), and you find yourself jobless with two one-way tickets to Bermuda that were never used, six stitches, slashed car tires, and a shattered cell phone. But at least that psycho is fucking gone (even though you still kinda miss them). The experience is vicious yet thrilling, and will never let you forget that we are, after all, animals.\n\nNot that I\u2019m speaking from personal experience or anything. Nope. Nothing to see here. Move along.\n\nThe Chemistry-Compatibility Matrix\nLow Chemistry/Low Compatibility\n\nA relationship devoid not only of intimacy but probably basic conversation too. On the rare occasion this does happen, it doesn\u2019t last long.\nHigh Chemistry/Low Compatibility\n\nWhen it feels so right, but you know it\u2019s oh-so-wrong. AKA, the walking dumpster fire of a relationship.\nLow Chemistry/High Compatibility\n\nBoring, mostly asexual companionship. Entire relationship comprised of discussions about Netflix, sweatpants, and frozen meal planning.\nHigh Chemistry/High Compatibility\n\nThe sweet spot. Great balance between intimacy and practicality. Oh yeah, baby.\nFINDING THE PERFECT FIT\n\nSpoiler alert: you won\u2019t.\n\nSearch all you want, but you will never, ever, find someone who has 100% compatibility and chemistry with you. \n\nSomeone whose life priorities are perfectly aligned with yours may still enjoy completely different leisure activities. You may swoon every time your partner smiles at you but get irritated by how they always make that weird sound when breathing.\n\n100% compatibility and chemistry doesn\u2019t exist. You\u2019d be dating yourself. And even then, you\u2019re going to have a bad time\u2014I mean, have you spent any time with yourself lately? \n\n70-80% compatibility and chemistry is what you should be aiming for. Is there a way to measure this? Fuck no. But that feels about right to me. This is more than enough to have a well-functioning relationship, to build a partnership based on mutual respect, to fall a little more in love with each passing day but also weather the storms when love just doesn\u2019t seem to be enough.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the dirty little secret: you don\u2019t want that remaining 20-30%. It\u2019s actually dealing with those \u201cflaws\u201d and surmounting the small irritations that makes a relationship feel meaningful and rewarding. So stop looking for \u201cthe one.\u201d Stop dreaming of someone who finishes all your sentences and does everything you want them to, exactly the way you like it. They don\u2019t exist. That\u2019s not a relationship, that\u2019s a rich fantasy life.\nKNOW WHAT YOU WANT\n\nNavigating the dating landscape with confidence requires that you understand compatibility and chemistry. If you want to ultimately end up enjoying your time with an amazing partner\u2014and I don\u2019t just mean enjoying sex (that should be a given, sex is neat-o), but I mean really, truly enjoying your time together\u2014then it\u2019s important you get a cognitive handle on these emotional indicators of compatibility and chemistry.\n\nThe most important aspect is understanding what you want\u2014what makes a person compatible with you, what personality traits have chemistry with you? The first question you should ask yourself is \u201cWhat do I want?\u201d5 And then you should probably ask yourself a few more questions.\n\nYou need to know what you like and what you want in a partner. Like if you want kids or not,6 or if you are really into blondes. Those answers matter. If you don\u2019t know, then you need to cautiously gain enough experience until you do know.\n\nBack when I was dating, I found that I was incapable of dating girls who weren\u2019t incredibly smart. I could make it 2-3 dates with a woman of average intelligence or less and that was usually solely by merit of drowning my entire face in alcohol. Since a long-term relationship with these women would have necessitated that I take up alcoholism as a hobby, we inevitably parted ways. I also learned that I don\u2019t work well with women who are particularly religious or who have socially conservative values. Just not my thing.\n\nI learned that I have chemistry with women who are driven and ambitious. Their personalities work with mine in a unique, yet comfortable way (for both of us). I\u2019ve also found my personality meshes well with women who are a tad neurotic, as I\u2019m generally too laid back for my own good. I \u201cclick\u201d with women who appreciate a dark, sarcastic wit and are very giving and caring. In my dating days, I regularly found myself seeing teachers, nurses, social workers, volunteer workers, etc. for multiple dates, which sometimes progressed to a serious relationship.\n\nThese are the women who work for me. Who works for you?"}]}

Smoothies came nice, but the bottle didn't come with the order. Emailed them with pictures and receipts only to be told I didn't have enough \"\"proof\"\" that I hadn't received the bottle. I had to make the smoothies in a water bottle for 2 weeks, which was unpleasant and left chunks of powder. Later I contacted them again, and for some reason they said OK and sent me a bottle. Was feeling okay about their customer service until I realized they had charged me for the bottle!!! I should not have been charged as I ordered it in the first place and it was missing---so it is not my fauly I did not receive it.\n\nDisappointed with the service and the smoothies being a little unpleasant to taste, I wanted to cancel, but the Manage Subscription button isn't working either. Contacted support and they said they canceled my subscription. Didn't think much of it until I received ANOTHER receipt saying that I purchased another box!!! I did NOT!!!\n\nRidiculous, and frankly, a quite sneaky website that makes it difficult to cancel your subscription, has awfully bad and unreliable customer service, and has a hard-to-navigate UI as well. I struggled so hard to find the button to cancel my subscription. If anything, that should be the first option when you go into your profile.\"\nThis is truly an amazing product. I notice a better sense of well-being, my skin looks better ( and people ask all the time about what new makeup I'm using). It has helped me change my eating habbits and lose weight. My scale and my blood tests don't lie, in the past six months the needle has moved a more positive direction and the only real change is this and I'm drinking more water. Just that easy. My energy level has come up as well and overall this does the trick. When I get caught out with nothing but fast food surrounding me, the gummys really support me in saying no and sustain me until I get home. I drink one smoothy in the morning ( except sometimes I mix it with oatmeal) and then on mid afternoon when I want to crave a snack. I'm gettimg nutritiom and curbing my eat monster all in one go. I truly cannot say enough good about this product and the price is more than fair ( the money I save from fastfood alone pays for the box).\nI am very happy with the smoothies and the bowls. The bowls are perfect lunch choices for me and everything has so much flavor.\nI love using Kencko, it is a great way to get in the fruits and vegetables that I need in smoothie form, especially as a person who doesn't get in as many as I should.\n\"My husband and I have busy schedules and often work long or odd hours, which means we turn to quick and convenient meal options which aren\u2019t necessarily healthy. We found and started buying Kencko smoothies about 7-8 months ago. We absolutely LOVE them. We drink them mixed with water, juice, milk. We generally start our day off with a smoothie and notice a difference in how we feel if we skip a day. We also like to mix the packets with fresh fruit, juice and ice for additional flavor, but it\u2019s definitely not necessary. There are a few flavors that are difficult to mix, even after breaking product up in the tube prior to mixing with liquid. I just throw it in a blender and all is good. Some of the beet-based and green flavors are too earthy tasting for us, but we love the reds, yellows, purples, golden plum, crimson, peaches, golds and the blush isn\u2019t too earthy.\n\nWe are hooked on Kencko smoothies. Shipping is fast, too and I like the discounts!\"\nLovely products and flavors. The perfect way to get organic fruit and veg in my diet in a convenient and delicious way. As a bonus, it arrived quickly.\ntheir website is full of bugs. it seems nearly a scam .. it's very hard to navigate into the personal account area and impossible to me to cancel the recurring payment. said so many times to them, they are very polite (so fake) and just don't care. the product seems good, even if there is not any evidence or proof or more detail that it's really organic and not some trash.\n\"Regret not reading other reviews first. Blocks of powder refuses to mix. Literally tastes gritty and is straight up a scam.\n\nEdit: Refunded my order and sent pictures to see how they can update their products.\"\nBanging. So yummy and quick to use. I\u2019ve seen complains about them being gritty. While they have a bit of texture it\u2019s no more than a normal smoothie and it\u2019s fibre. The customer service is incredible. They\u2019re were so helpful and went above and beyond to ensure I wasn\u2019t accidentally ordering too much (I accidentally set up multiple subscriptions.)

For context, they never delivered the order and were extremely unhelpful throughout the process. Actually, as of today, the order still says \u201con its way\u201d via the link they provided. To make matters worse, I started receiving promotional materials to my home address asking me to come back to the service. The audacity of this company astounds me - thank goodness I gave my business to one of their competitors.\n\"I've been enjoying Kencko for about 5 months, and it's great! The flavor choices are awesome and help me hit all the nutritional goals! I fell into health issues and was in the hospital for a bit. When i got out I had a month backlog of Kencko with more on the way since I wasn't around to ask it to delay (which is painless and doesn't require fighting customer service, just a simple easy button if you need to). I contacted customer service to explain what happened and within 3 minutes they had halted in the in-progress shipment for me so I could catch up.\n\nWonderful company, and they care!\""}]}

Mr Corven, the superintendent under the Contract, refused Beckhaus\u2019 request. On 26 April 2002 Beckhaus lodged progress claim No 7 for $702,678.45 with the Council. Mr Corven refused to certify this claim.\n\nBeckhaus commenced proceedings against the Council claiming the amount said to be owing in respect of progress claim No 7 as well as amounts said to be owing in respect of two variations under the Contract (Variation 17 and Variation 21).\n\nThe Council filed three cross-claims. It alleged, firstly, that Beckhaus had not completed the work in accordance with the Contract and the Council, in consequence, had suffered loss and damage being the costs of rectification. It alleged, secondly, that the Contract was an entire contract and the consideration for the total amount paid by the Council to Beckhaus thereunder ($1,654,747.40) had wholly failed. The Council claimed repayment of this sum. It alleged, thirdly, that Beckhaus had made representations that were misleading and deceptive (constituting conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) that led to the Council suffering loss and damage.\n\nThe Council joined Mr Beckhaus as a cross-defendant, alleging that he had aided, abetted, counselled or procured the conduct of Beckhaus which contravened the Trade Practices Act and was knowingly a party to that contravention. The Council claimed damages from Mr Beckhaus on that basis.\n\nAt a late stage in the proceedings the Council sought to amend its pleadings so as to claim liquidated damages.\n\nMaster Macready upheld Beckhaus\u2019 claim in respect of progress claim No 7 and the claims in respect of Variations 17 and 21. He refused the Council\u2019s application to amend so as to claim liquidated damages. He upheld the Council\u2019s cross-claims to the extent of $40,000 (but otherwise dismissed them). After \u201cconsolidating\u201d the orders he granted a verdict and judgment in favour of Beckhaus in the sum of $905,009.53. The Council appealed against the orders made by Master Macready.\n\nHELD per Ipp JA (Hodgson JA and McColl JA agreeing):\n\n1. As long as the Council maintained that the Contract was alive and had not been terminated, and held Beckhaus to its obligation to complete the work in accordance with it, on the Council\u2019s contention the work remained lawfully in Beckhaus\u2019 possession.\n\n2. While the work was in Beckhaus\u2019 possession, the Council suffered no loss by reason of defective or incomplete work; the work, not being in the Council\u2019s possession, did not at that stage form part of its patrimony.\n\n3. The situation changed when the Contract was terminated. When that occurred, the work (in its defective and incomplete state) was handed over to the Council. At that stage the Council suffered loss by being in possession of defective and incomplete work.\n\n4. The parties to a contract can agree that the contract is to be terminated on the basis that there is a mutual release from future performance only and that rights accrued to the date of termination will remain of full force and effect. By no later than 15 March 2004, when the trial commenced before Master Macready, both parties tacitly accepted that the Contract was at an end.\n\n5. A progress claim is a claim for payment on account. As the Contract had been terminated, it was not appropriate for Beckhaus to be awarded any sum on account and the financial position between the parties had to be determined finally. Thus, the claim for progress claim No 7 could not succeed.\n\n6. Clause 44.6 of the Contract provided that if Beckhaus committed a material breach of the Contract and if the Council took the work out of its hands and had it completed by another contractor, a balance would be struck between:\n(a) The costs of the Council of completing the work, and\n(b) The amount the Council would have paid Beckhaus if all the work had been duly completed by it in accordance with the Contract."}]}

As you rise up and bring your hips forward, you want to rip the paper apart with your feet (your feet don\u2019t actually move; you are just pushing outward on them into the floor). \n4. At the same time, you are pressing outward/spreading the floor/ripping the paper in half. Squeeze your buttocks just like you do in the bridge exercise. Use the gluteal muscles to bring your hips up and forward to the starting position. Try this several times.\n5. Can you feel the glutes engaging? This is tricky. You should now feel the glutes working more than the quads. If not, read through this exercise again and try it a few more times. If you can\u2019t get it, go to Troubleshooting, following. \n6. If your back or knees hurt before, does engaging the glutes get rid of or significantly decrease the pain? It should. If not, try this exercise a few more times. If it still doesn\u2019t, go to Troubleshooting, following. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m not feeling the glutes engaging.\u201d This issue is common and it may take time to master this exercise. You are trying to change a good many years of behavior here and it isn\u2019t going to happen overnight. Try these first:\n\u25a0 Make sure the feet are turned forward, not outward. \n\u25a0 Make sure your knees aren\u2019t coming forward over your toes as you squat back.\n\u25a0 Make sure you are lightly pressing outward on your knees and/or heels (try both: some cues work for some people and some don\u2019t) as you bring your hips up and forward.\n\u25a0 If you still can\u2019t feel them, go back and try a few clamshells, bridges, and hip extensions, and then come back and try again.\n\u25a0 If it still doesn\u2019t work, go to the trigger point chapter (Chapter 14) and then try again.\n\u2022 \u201cMy knees and/or low back hurt.\u201d Keep in mind that a very small percentage of people may never be able to squat pain-free. That being said, the vast majority of you will be able to squat to some degree with little to no knee or back pain. Pain in the low back usually means you aren\u2019t maintaining neutral spine and/or you aren\u2019t engaging the glutes, which is putting too much load through the spine. See the first troubleshooting item and make sure you are engaging the glutes. Try squatting with a very small range of motion for a time, slowly increasing your range of motion over the coming weeks. If your knees or low back still hurt, go on to the trigger point chapter (Chapter 14) and then come back and try this again. \nSplit Squat\nThe last \u201cglute integrated\u201d movement we will cover in this chapter is the split squat. There is an \u201cadded plus\u201d to learning this one: For many back pain sufferers, the split squat offers a painless way to get up off of the floor. We\u2019ll go over applied movement in a moment, but first try this (admittedly challenging) exercise. \nMany of you have probably heard of the \u201clunge\u201d exercise. The split squat is the precursor to the lunge. If you know what a lunge is, think of the split squat as a lunge in which your feet stay in place. The key (and the challenge) is to use the glutes (in the rear leg), not the quads (in front) to bring your body up.\nStep 1: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in place. \n\nStep 3: Step forward, putting one leg in front of the other, about two feet apart, depending on your height. The distance between your feet is likely going to be slightly greater than you naturally want. Step out of your comfort zone a little bit. If you are worried about falling you can hold on to something to help you balance. Try to distribute your weight evenly on both feet. This is your starting position for the exercise.\n\nStep 4: Slowly and carefully lower your torso toward the ground. Don\u2019t bend forward, just lower straight down. Think of an elevator. If you can, go down so that the top half of your front leg (your thigh) is parallel with the floor and the lower part of your front leg is perpendicular to the floor.\nStep 5: As you are going down, bend your back knee so that it points straight toward the floor (not forward). \nStep 6: Here\u2019s the hard part: As you start to rise, initiate the movement with the glutes of your rear leg, not the quads (thigh) of your front leg. Read that again: It\u2019s counterintuitive. Use the glutes of the rear leg to pull yourself, relying as little as possible on the quads. Aim for a 60/40 ratio (or even a 70/30 ratio) of glutes to quads. \nStep 7: Come up to the starting position, maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core. Your feet should never move out of starting position. \nStep 8: Repeat for ten to twelve reps, and two to three sets, with three being the goal. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t have the balance.\u201d In the beginning, hold on to a table, chair, etc., until you develop the engagement and strength of the glutes. Your stability/balance will improve as you learn to use these muscles.\n\u2022 \u201cMy knee(s) hurt(s).\u201d Guess why? I\u2019m starting to sound like a broken record here. Your glutes aren\u2019t working. Take one hand and press into the glutes of the rear leg as you do the exercise. Do you feel them tightening? Your hip should be extending as you come up. If you don\u2019t feel the glutes tightening as you rise, go back to the standing hip extension for a while, and then try this exercise again after you feel the glutes working in that exercise. \nYou may have struggled with this chapter. That makes sense: Your glutes have atrophied and these are glute exercises, so of course they\u2019re hard.

The reasons why an algorithm wins are mixed and uncertain.\nFor example, the winning algorithm might be trained with a much larger dataset; the dataset might be composed of replays collected from more professional players; the features might contain more information; or, the macro-management module might be more compatible with the specific AI bot.\nIt is hard to tell which macro-management algorithm is better unless a standard dataset is used.\n\nTo take the research of learning macro-management from replays a step further, we build a new dataset MSC based on SC2LE.\nIt's the biggest dataset dedicated for macro-management in StarCraft II, which could be used for assorted tasks like build order prediction and global state evaluation.\n% MSC is based on SC2LE for three reasons: 1) SC2LE is the largest replay dataset in StarCraft. 2) SC2LE is supported officially. 3) The replays in SC2LE have higher quality and more standard format.\nWe define standard procedure for processing replays from SC2LE, as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:msc}.\nAfter processing, our dataset consists of well-designed feature vectors, pre-defined action space and the final result of each match.\nAll replays are then divided into training, validation and test set.\nBased on MSC, we train baseline models and present the initial baseline results for global state evaluation and build order prediction, which are two of the key tasks in macro-management.\n% For the sake of research on other tasks, we also show some statistics of MSC and list some downstream tasks suitable for it.\nOur main contributions are two folds and summarized as follows:\n\n\u4e0d\u8981\u56de\u590d"}]}

Names like Baboon Lodge and Porcupine Place were handpainted beside the wooden doors that led out to cobblestone paths, and the windows were left open so that guests woke up to the rustling of the jacaranda leaves and the steady calming crash of the sea\u2019s waves. The wicker trays held a selection of fine teas. At midmorning, discreet black maids made the bed, cleaned the elegant bathtub, vacuumed the carpet, and left wildflowers in handcrafted vases. Ujunwa found it odd that the African Writers Workshop was held here, at Jumping Monkey Hill, outside Cape Town. The name itself was incongruous, and the resort had the complacence of the well-fed about it, the kind of place where she imagined affluent foreign tourists would dart around taking pictures of lizards and then return home still mostly unaware that there were more black people than red-capped lizards in South Africa. Later, she would learn that Edward Campbell had chosen the resort; he had spent weekends there when he was a lecturer at the University of Cape Town years ago. But she didn\u2019t know this the afternoon Edward\u2014an old man in a summer hat who smiled to show two front teeth the color of mildew\u2014picked her up at the airport. He kissed her on both cheeks. He asked if she had had any trouble with her prepaid ticket in Lagos, if she minded waiting for the Ugandan whose flight would come soon, if she was hungry. He told her that his wife, Isabel, had already picked up most of the other workshop participants and that their friends Simon and Hermione, who had come with them from London as paid staff, were arranging a welcome lunch back at the resort. He and Ujunwa sat down on a bench in Arrivals. He balanced the sign with the Ugandan\u2019s name on his shoulder and told her how humid Cape Town was at this time of the year, how pleased he was about the workshop arrangements. He lengthened his words. His accent was what the British called \u201cposh,\u201d the kind some rich Nigerians tried to mimic and ended up sounding unintentionally funny. Ujunwa wondered if he was the one who had selected her for the workshop. Probably not; it was the British Council that had made the call for entries and then selected the best. Edward had moved a little and sat closer to her. He was asking what she did back home in Nigeria. Ujunwa faked a wide yawn and hoped he would stop talking. He repeated his question and asked whether she had taken leave from her job to attend the workshop. He was watching her intently. He could have been anything from sixty-five to ninety. She could not tell his age from his face; it was pleasant but unformed, as though God, having created him, had slapped him flat against a wall and smeared his features all over his face. She smiled vaguely and said that she had lost her job just before she left Lagos\u2014a job in banking\u2014and so there had been no need to take leave. She yawned again. He seemed keen to know more and she did not want to say more, and so when she looked up and saw the Ugandan walking toward them, she was relieved. The Ugandan looked sleepy. He was in his early thirties, square-faced and dark-skinned, with uncombed hair that had tightened into kinky balls. He bowed as he shook Edward\u2019s hand with both of his and then turned and mumbled a hello to Ujunwa. He sat in the front seat of the Renault. The drive to the resort was long, on roads haphazardly chiseled into steep hills, and Ujunwa worried that Edward was too old to drive so fast. She held her breath until they arrived at the cluster of thatch roofs and manicured paths. A smiling blond woman showed her to her cabin, Zebra Lair, which had a four-poster bed and linen that smelled of lavender. Ujunwa sat on the bed for a moment and then got up to unpack, looking out of the window from time to time to search the canopy of trees for lurking monkeys. There were none, unfortunately, Edward told the participants later, as they ate lunch under pink umbrellas on the terrace, their tables pushed close to the railing so that they could look down at the turquoise sea. He pointed at each person and did the introductions. The white South African woman was from Durban, while the black man came from Johannesburg. The Tanzanian man came fromArusha, the Ugandan man from Entebbe, the Zimbabwean woman from Bulawayo, the Kenyan man from Nairobi, and the Senegalese woman, the youngest at twenty-three, had flown in from Paris, where she attended university. Edward introduced Ujunwa last: \u201cUjunwa Ogundu is our Nigerian participant and she lives in Lagos.\u201d Ujunwa looked around the table and wondered with whom she would get along. The Senegalese woman was the most promising, with the irreverent sparkle in her eyes and the Francophone accent and the streaks of silver in her fat dreadlocks. The Zimbabwean woman had longer, thinner dreadlocks, and the cowries in them clinked as she moved her head from side to side. She seemed hyper, overactive, and Ujunwa thought she might like her, but only the way she liked alcohol\u2014in small amounts. The Kenyan and the Tanzanian looked ordinary, almost indistinguishable\u2014tall men with wide foreheads who were wearing tattered beards and shortsleeved patterned shirts. She thought she would like them in the uninvested way that one likes nonthreatening people. She wasn\u2019t sure about the South Africans: the white woman had a tooearnest face, humorless and free of makeup, and the black man looked patiently pious, like a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who went from door to door and smiled when each was shut in his face. As for the Ugandan, Ujunwa had disliked him from the airport, and did so even more now because of his toadying answers to Edward\u2019s questions, the way he leaned forward to speak only to Edward and ignored the other participants. They, in turn, said little to him. They all knew he was the winner of the last Lipton African Writers\u2019 Prize, with an award of fifteen thousand pounds. They didn\u2019t include him in the polite talk about their flights. After they ate the creamy chicken prettied with herbs, after they drank the sparkling water that came in glossy bottles, Edward stood up to give the welcoming address. He squinted as he spoke, and his thin hair fluttered in the breeze that smelled of the sea. He started by telling them what they already knew\u2014that the workshop would be for two weeks; that it was his idea but of course funded graciously by the Chamberlain Arts Foundation, just as the Lipton African Writers\u2019 Prize had been his idea and funded also by the good people at the foundation; that they were all expected to produce one story for possible publication in the Oratory; that laptops would be provided in the cabins; that they would write during the first week and review each participant\u2019s work during the second week; and that the Ugandan would be workshop leader. Then he talked about himself, how African literature had been his cause for forty years, a lifelong passion that started at Oxford. He glanced often at the Ugandan. The Ugandan nodded eagerly to acknowledge each glance. Finally Edward introduced his wife, Isabel, although they had all met her. He told them she was an animal rights activist, an old Africa hand who had spent her teenage years in Botswana. He looked proud when she stood up, as if her tall and lean gracefulness made up for what he lacked in appearance. Her hair was a muted red, cut so that wisps framed her face. She patted it as she said, \u201cEdward, really, an introduction.\u201d Ujunwa imagined, though, that Isabel had wanted that introduction, that perhaps she had even reminded Edward of it, saying, Now, dear, remember to introduce me properly at lunch. Her tone would have been delicate. The next day at breakfast, Isabel used just such a tone when she sat next to Ujunwa and said that surely, with that exquisite bone structure, Ujunwa had to come from Nigerian royal stock. The first thing that came to Ujunwa\u2019s mind was to ask if Isabel ever needed royal blood to explain the good looks of friends back in London. She did not ask that but instead said\u2014because she could not resist \u2014that she was indeed a princess and came from an ancient lineage and that one of her forebears had captured a Portuguese trader in the seventeenth century and kept him, pampered and oiled, in a royal cage. She stopped to sip her cranberry juice and smile into her glass. Isabel said, brightly, that she could always spot royal blood and she hoped Ujunwa would support her antipoaching campaign and it was just horrible, horrible, how many endangered apes people were killing and they didn\u2019t even eat them, never mind all that talk about bush meat, they just used the private parts for charms. After breakfast, Ujunwa called her mother and told her about the resort and about Isabel and was pleased when her mother chuckled. She hung up and sat in front of her laptop and thought about how long it had been since her mother had really laughed. She sat there for a long time, moving the mouse from side to side, trying to decide whether to name her character something common, like Chioma, or something exotic, like Ibari. Chioma lives with her mother in Lagos. She has a degree in economics from Nsukka, has recently finished her National Youth Service, and every Thursday she buys The Guardian and scours the employment section and sends out her CV in brown manila envelopes. She hears nothing for weeks. Finally she gets a phone call inviting her to an interview. After the first few questions, the man says he will hire her and then walks across and stands behind her and reaches over her shoulders to squeeze her breasts. She hisses, \u201cStupid man! You cannot respect yourself!\u201d and leaves. Weeks of silence follow. She helps out at her mother\u2019s boutique. She sends out more envelopes. At the next interview, the woman, speaking in the fakest, silliest accent Chioma has ever heard, tells her she wants somebody foreign-educated, and Chioma almost laughs as she leaves. More weeks of silence. Chioma has not seen her father in months, but she decides to go to his new office in Victoria Island to ask if he can help her find a job. Their meeting is tense. \u201cWhy have you not come since, eh?\u201d he asks, pretending to be angry, because she knows it is easier for him to be angry, it is easier to be angry with people after you have hurt them. He makes some calls. He gives her a thin roll of twohundred-naira notes. He does not ask about her mother. She notices that the Yellow Woman\u2019s photo is on his desk. Her mother had described her well: \u201cShe is very fair, she looks mixed, and the thing is that she is not even pretty, she has a face like an overripe yellow pawpaw.\u201d The chandelier in the main dining room of Jumping Monkey Hill hung so low that Ujunwa could extend her hand and touch it. Edward sat at one end of the long, white-covered table, Isabel at the other, and the participants in between. The hardwood floors thumped noisily as waiters walked around and handed out menus. Ostrich medallions. Smoked salmon. Chicken in orange sauce. Edward urged everyone to eat the ostrich. It was simply mah-ve-lous. Ujunwa did not like the idea of eating an ostrich, did not even know that people ate ostriches, and when she said so, Edward laughed good-naturedly and said that of course ostrich was an African staple. Everyone else ordered the ostrich, and when Ujunwa\u2019s chicken, too citrusy, came, she wondered if perhaps she should have had the ostrich. It looked like beef, anyway.

You Senegalese are too brainwashed by the French! They talked about the war in the Sudan, about the decline of the African Writers Series, about books and writers. They agreed that Dambudzo Marechera was astonishing, that Alan Paton was patronizing, that Isak Dinesen was unforgivable. The Kenyan put on a generic European accent and, between drags at his cigarette, recited what Isak Dinesen had said about all Kikuyu children becoming mentally retarded at the age of nine.

Mr Corven, the superintendent under the Contract, refused Beckhaus\u2019 request. On 26 April 2002 Beckhaus lodged progress claim No 7 for $702,678.45 with the Council. Mr Corven refused to certify this claim.\n\nBeckhaus commenced proceedings against the Council claiming the amount said to be owing in respect of progress claim No 7 as well as amounts said to be owing in respect of two variations under the Contract (Variation 17 and Variation 21).\n\nThe Council filed three cross-claims. It alleged, firstly, that Beckhaus had not completed the work in accordance with the Contract and the Council, in consequence, had suffered loss and damage being the costs of rectification. It alleged, secondly, that the Contract was an entire contract and the consideration for the total amount paid by the Council to Beckhaus thereunder ($1,654,747.40) had wholly failed. The Council claimed repayment of this sum. It alleged, thirdly, that Beckhaus had made representations that were misleading and deceptive (constituting conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) that led to the Council suffering loss and damage.\n\nThe Council joined Mr Beckhaus as a cross-defendant, alleging that he had aided, abetted, counselled or procured the conduct of Beckhaus which contravened the Trade Practices Act and was knowingly a party to that contravention. The Council claimed damages from Mr Beckhaus on that basis.\n\nAt a late stage in the proceedings the Council sought to amend its pleadings so as to claim liquidated damages.\n\nMaster Macready upheld Beckhaus\u2019 claim in respect of progress claim No 7 and the claims in respect of Variations 17 and 21. He refused the Council\u2019s application to amend so as to claim liquidated damages. He upheld the Council\u2019s cross-claims to the extent of $40,000 (but otherwise dismissed them). After \u201cconsolidating\u201d the orders he granted a verdict and judgment in favour of Beckhaus in the sum of $905,009.53. The Council appealed against the orders made by Master Macready.\n\nHELD per Ipp JA (Hodgson JA and McColl JA agreeing):\n\n1. As long as the Council maintained that the Contract was alive and had not been terminated, and held Beckhaus to its obligation to complete the work in accordance with it, on the Council\u2019s contention the work remained lawfully in Beckhaus\u2019 possession.\n\n2. While the work was in Beckhaus\u2019 possession, the Council suffered no loss by reason of defective or incomplete work; the work, not being in the Council\u2019s possession, did not at that stage form part of its patrimony.\n\n3. The situation changed when the Contract was terminated. When that occurred, the work (in its defective and incomplete state) was handed over to the Council. At that stage the Council suffered loss by being in possession of defective and incomplete work.\n\n4. The parties to a contract can agree that the contract is to be terminated on the basis that there is a mutual release from future performance only and that rights accrued to the date of termination will remain of full force and effect. By no later than 15 March 2004, when the trial commenced before Master Macready, both parties tacitly accepted that the Contract was at an end.\n\n5. A progress claim is a claim for payment on account. As the Contract had been terminated, it was not appropriate for Beckhaus to be awarded any sum on account and the financial position between the parties had to be determined finally. Thus, the claim for progress claim No 7 could not succeed.\n\n6. Clause 44.6 of the Contract provided that if Beckhaus committed a material breach of the Contract and if the Council took the work out of its hands and had it completed by another contractor, a balance would be struck between:\n(a) The costs of the Council of completing the work, and\n(b) The amount the Council would have paid Beckhaus if all the work had been duly completed by it in accordance with the Contract."}]}

DHL delivers on time or sooner. \ud83d\ude09\n\"a shame, because the smoothies were good and convenient. however, I was hacing an issue with my subscription where it kept cancelling for no reason. I updated my card details I rechecked my box\nand customer service kept telling me just to rush delivery and wait, and I would get a delivery, but it never worked. I feel like they didnt understand or try to understand my problem, or really listen to what I said. I have been trying for 13 days to place an order to be delivered and feel really unvalued as a customer\"\n\"Wonderful for my gut health. Two days into my second kencko order, and i can drink coffee again without acid reflux.\nThe fibers which are clearly present was exactly what I was missing in my diet. Not sure anyone else understands the small pieces are important, and that these smoothies are NOT CANDY!\n\nVitamins and everything you need in the packs, some tasty, some green and really healthy. How smoothies should be.\nPrice is a little high, but i am well aware how much water is in fruit, and that it is removed from the powders....\nVery much worth the cost for health reasons!\n\nTheir new gum drops are delicious. Very natural taste and a lot of fruit+ in a small candy. You only want and need to eat a few and your satisfied.\n\nProtein packs....well pea protein, so not much there. A little too expensive, but still practical.\"\n\"I\u2019ve been writing to them so many times, they keep removing money from my account.\nAnd sending me boxes.\n\nI have told them i don\u2019t want to be stuck i only wanna order when i want!\n\nThese people are stupid, I will change bank account from tommorow\"\n\"Personally, I love Kencko. Can't rate them highly enough. I got an Instagram ad for them before the pandemic, and decided to give one of their subscriptions a shot. I didn't regret it one bit. Unfortunately I paused it for a while since I was traveling and you can't update your location every 3-4 months. However, I'd recommend it to everyone.\n\nWhat stands out:\n+ Super easy to prepare.\n+ Flavors are great. For those saying it tastes like water.. C'mon. I typically would put 2 servings into 1 drink, which made it delicious. Truly delicious.\n+ Nutritious. As someone who's lazy and often forgets to eat veggies/superfoods himself, this is a super useful alternative.\n+ Easy to transport. You can easily take the servings with you when traveling etc..\n\nHighly recommended!\"\n\"Initially, I was very happy with this service. The taste of the smoothies takes some getting used to, but now I love them!\nUnfortunately, their subscription service lives its own life and get turned on even after I've cancelled it! Please stop sending me all these freaking boxes and taking my money! I told your customer service back in December that I don't want any more. There is nowhere I can cancel my subscription on the website and they haven't answered my emails since 2 days. And they are about to charge me \u20ac120 which I've NEVER allowed or signed up for!\n\nAvoid unless you want to be stuck in a lifelong monthly subscription!\"\nHatte Kencko f\u00fcr mehrere Monate abonniert, Lieferung kam immer an, Smoothies muss man sich halt geschmacklich durchtesten was einem gef\u00e4llt oder nicht. Die Website an sich funktioniert jedoch oft nicht so wie sie es soll, weshalb ich mehrere Wochen brauchte um endlich meine Mitgliedschaft zu k\u00fcndigen, konnte sie aber vorher problemlos verschieben, sodass ich nicht mehr Geld bezahlt hab als ich wollte. Schlie\u00dfe nicht aus das Abo zu einem sp\u00e4teren Zeitpunkt zu erneuern, f\u00fcr den Moment ist es mir jedoch zu teuer.\nThis seems like a good idea with cute packaging. I was supposed to get the mixing bottle for free but the checkout erased my code from my order. So I was first overcharged. Took a long time to arrive. To top it off, the products taste gross. Fail.\n\"I\u2019m obsessed!\nI found this via Instagram and have been using it on and off for a while now. I love most of the flavors, and it\u2019s super easy to blend.. just make sure liquid goes in first!

The packet mixes well with water and tastes great! A wonderful way to get fruits and veggies that are organic when they\u2019re getting harder to find-plus it\u2019s shelf stable-a major perk for winter and our current status with stores.\nHonestly, it's great! I love that they're organic and that nothing is added (no preservatives or added sugar). In my busy lifestyle, I love that I can shake up a bottle and already be one step closer to being healthier than not having any/enough fruits and veggies in my day. And I love that they also keep the fiber, which is so important for a healthy gut!\nThey claim that their products are \"certified organic\" but there's no any kind of certification on their package. Tried to reach out to their customer support but the answer has been very vague to evade the topic. I do enjoy the smoothies and sweets though. Just hope that they don't have misleading advertisement.\nI wanted some fresh smoothie for summer, and I am VERY disappointed, I don't even know what a gonna do with the rest of it. Tryed one, and it taste BAD. I regret so much to buy from them.\nAwesome experience. Delivery took less than 4 days, even though I live in Eastern Europe. The wrapping is superb, really makes you feel good when you open it, and the taste in also pretty good. If you get the 3-for-2 bundles it's also a bargain. Definitely would recommend and I will keep buying from them.\nI like their products! Very easy to drink and I feel a lot better after"}]}

Rover can generate test steps to maximize test activity coverage, state coverage, it can check for crashes and ensure app reliability, find exceptions, check the cpu and memory performance, identify frame drops or higher load times, \nCheck the data usage, and compare your app screens with a previous version of your app (with the help of hawkeye) it can even simulate things like gps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy\nThe inferior quality of apps can be attributed to insufficient testing as a result of rapid development cycles. Apps usually have many states/screens and transitions and are highly interactive in nature. So for apps, exploratory testing is the best way to test an application and ensures all the functionalities are tested, across different device configurations. but the caveat is that it requires an expert tester to know what to test, when to test and What data should they use etc. Also creating tests is a time consuming process and often requires enormous time and effort and costs a lot. it takes a lot of timejust for setting up the environment. A lot if instrumentation is required. Also the app functions can only be explored with a particular sequence of events. Rover can be considered as a paradigm shift in the world of testing. Do we really need someone to test the functionalities of our app, or can the machines test themselves. This is where we present rover. Rover is an end to end fully autonomous blackbox(does not require source code) testing solution, which only requires your app (let it be apk/ipa) and it will generate test inputs automatically and apply them instantaneously. Like you can just upload your apk to rover and it will start testing it. You might think that what is the difference between rover and monkey or model based tests created based on structure derived from uiautomator. In one word, Intelligence. while monkey testing generate inputs/events that are redundant and unfruitful, by randomly performing nonproductive steps, consuming a lot of time in the process. Rover identifies what element, action sequences generate the best tests. Okay, we have talked about monkey testing, what about systematic exploration using something like depth first search based on the UI tree of the application. One of the main issues faced by model based approach is ineffective modelling. App developers does not follow a strict model while developing widgets in their app, say a graph structure. So for some applications model based approaches gives more coverage but for some other it will be stuck in a loop. Also it is sensitive to changes in UI, like a dynamic widget changing its state. And it has only a limited range. Also rover gives you a jump start with your app, because rover can be used as soon as your app is built, or a new version is out. You can find stability issues, or do visual regression and the performance as soon as a new version of your app is released. when you start using rover, you will know it is something you needed a long time back. \n\nHow\nRover is essentially a test step generator. Once It installs and launch the app, it will start analyzing what is on the screen. The input is an apk and output is a state transition diagram. Each screen and elements in them is uniquely represented. A reinforcement learning agent looks at these custom representations and start sending events/actions to the device to perform on the elements. Rover internally predicts these actions using deep reinforcement learning and also has a path planning algorithm built in to it to identify what element comes next. This paths can be learned by generating a probability distribution over elements based on previous test cases or the agent itself will figure out the trajectories after going through the elements in an episodic fashion. The more rover explores the more it would unravel potential defects. Rover generates sequence of actions that will simulate user interactions suck as clicking, scrolling, typing text etc. Some of these actions require an element and some of them don\u2019t.\n\nEach app is modelled as an environment for an agent (rover) to interact with. Reinforcement learning is very close to how humans learn and the concept is based on behavioral psychology and it a key technique in AI. Simply put, an agent will interact with an environment.the agent is either rewarded or punished for the actions it will take on the environment. The ultimate goal is to find the actions that will lead to maximum reward. There are four basic concepts in RL. State, action, reward and policy. The state is the current situation of the environment. The model predicts the next state and reward by considering the future situations, like planning a sequence of actions. The action is how we interact with the environment. In rover the actions are the interactions that we can have with the app. Eg: clicking, setting text etc. The policy is the function that determines what actions to choose next.Like a set of rules for selecting actions. A reward is how we evaluate the performed action. An optimal policy is the state-transitions that will maximize the cumulative reward. The learning involves selecting the best actions. We use Q learning to navigate through the app. The Q value or the action value is determines the quality of the action in a particular state. We are trying to find the optimal Q value which is the maximum expected cumulative reward for a given state action pair. \nNow let us see how rover applies Deep Q learning for exploratory testing. A Q function is rewarded with every action selection is a particular state over the app. The reward varies after every iteration. Rover is curious. So the algorithm is structured in such a way that the actions that are already performed gets a lower reward thus leading to lower redundancy. Every action that results in a state change is rewarded highly. Also if the app crashes we obtain a higher reward which helps in locating crashes. The app environment will not provide any direct rewards. The agent tries to visit more states to collect a higher reward. The action selection from a set of possible actions is one of the main parts of the algorithm. We use UCB, upper confidence bound strategy for learning policy \u2013 the set of actions that will form our test script. Another important factor is exploration vs exploitation. The agent has to determine whether it should explore more and more actions in a particular state or should it stick with the actions with the highest reward. A hyperparameter epsilon determines how much to explore and how much to exploit the current policy. Initially the agent will be set to explore more and eventually the epsilon value is decayed to promote more exploitation. UCB ensure that each action is action is performed well. \n Q learning with UCB exploration is the strategy used by rover to generate test cases. It is guided by the UI. Since generating test steps is a typical example of a sequential decision making problem we use the principle of \u201coptimism in the face of uncertainty\u201d. The agent believes it can get higher rewards by exploring unexplored states. In essence, visiting more states and trying out new actions is more rewarding than sticking with old states and old actions. When the agent gets into a new screen and apply a new action we give a specific fixed reward. This reward is then reduced for the state, action pair reducing its priority."}]}

BACKGROUND\n1.1 SCCC collaborates with arts and cultural groups, and community partners to promote and develop local Chinese culture. Through engaging and accessible content, SCCC hopes to nurture a greater appreciation of our multi-cultural identity and instill a stronger sense of belonging.\n1.2 SCCC will be commissioning a Chinese New Year art installation to celebrate the Year of the Dragon in 2024. The installation, targeted at youths and young families, shall include elements of Chinese Singaporean culture, and present SCCC as a vibrant and youthful arts and culture organisation. Refer to Annex A and B for references.\n1.4 The installation will be on display from December 2023 to April 2024. As the display period overlaps with the Chinese New Year and Singapore Art Week 2024 periods, the installation is required to have elements that suit both events.\n1.5 The theme of the exhibition is \u201ccelebration through play\u201d.\n1.6 Tenderers are required to submit design, build/production, maintenance, and logistical support for an art installation presented in the form of children\u2019s playground on SCCC\u2019s Roof Garden.\n1.7 As part of this Contract, the Tenderer shall work closely with SCCC for the design, and production throughout the contract period. The appointed Tenderer shall take into consideration the design, branding, and identity of SCCC.\n1.8 The design proposal shall also take into consideration suitable safety and security measures to safeguard all works on display. Refer to Annex H for safety requirements for playgrounds.\n2. OVERVIEW OF ART INSTALLATION\n2.1 The art installation is meant to celebrate the Year of Dragon whilst taking into consideration the Singapore Art Week. The exhibition venue is at SCCC\u2019s Roof Garden. See Annex C for Roof Garden layout.\n2.2 Tenderers are expected to propose designs that meet the following objectives:\na. To present Chinese New Year as a festival that brings everyone together, and relevant to children.\nb. To present SCCC as a vibrant and youthful organisation.\nc. To include design elements of Chinese Singaporean culture.\n2.3 The brief for the Roof Garden installation is create an immersive display using the design motif of dragon in the form of a children\u2019s playground as it will be the Year of the Dragon in 2024. An example would be the outdoor children\u2019s playground at Aarhus Denmark\u2019s Dokk1 library. Refer to Annex A for photos of playground.\n2.4 Tenderers should also take into consideration the lighting condition at the Roof Garden as it is open from 10am to 10pm daily. As most visitors turn up at the Roof Garden in the evening, the installation should have attractive light effects.\nPage 15 of 43\n2.5 The art installation may utilise the entire Roof Garden space, but must include installations on the lawn, and have designs (using stickers or equivalent non-destructive media) on all four light boxes.\n2.6 Tenderers must propose public engagement activity/activities at the Roof Garden during the exhibition to serve as a draw to the exhibition. For example, a light show was held on the last Saturday of every month during the SCCC 2023 Chinese New Year installation exhibition \u5154gether.\n3. OVERVIEW OF RED PACKET AND E-GREETING CARD\n3.1 SCCC works with local artists to design a red packet for Chinese New Year to reflect our distinctive Chinese Singaporean culture. The design usually takes reference from the year\u2019s Chinese New Year programmes to provide a coherent branding.\n3.2 As part of this tender, Tenderers are required to design a Chinese New Year red packet that takes reference from the Roof Garden installation and show distinctive Chinese Singaporean cultural elements. The red packet artwork shall also be adapted to an e-greeting card and a WhatsApp sticker pack. See Annex D for reference.\n3.3 The red packet artwork dimension is 90mm x 165mm (portrait / landscape, 300dpi). Tenderer may propose one single design or a set of designs. It will be used as a marketing collateral to drive footfall to the Centre and create media interest to generate good media coverage and build awareness of the Centre.\n3.4 The e-card will be used for sending email greetings to SCCC\u2019s stakeholders and e-newsletter subscribers. Dimension is 900px (H) X 780px (W) in GIF format, or any suitable dimension for e-mail use (Outlook and MailChimp).\n3.5 The artwork will be adapted into a sticker pack. The sticker pack shall consist of at least 10 animated stickers that are related to the Roof Garden installation and Chinese New Year. The sticker pack will be uploaded to Sticker.ly and Telegram for public to download. It will be used as a marketing tool to raise awareness for the Roof Garden installation during Chinese New Year.\n3.6 The production of red packet will be undertaken by SCCC's designated printer or printer recommended by Tenderer."}]}

This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.\n\nIn the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform \"sanity checks\" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.\n\nIn the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.\n\n[Code] \nimport pandas as pd\nbusiness\\_path = \"yelp\\_academic\\_dataset\\_business.json\"\ndf\\_business = pd.read\\_json(business\\_path, lines=True)\ndf\\_business.info()\n\n# Schema of Dataframe\n# Columns in df with counts, datatype, and example values:\n# business\\_id (150346, object, ym3e\\_a1L4gyKZWU1-LuRYQ)\n# name (150346, object, J J Gandy's Pies)\n# address (150346, object, 5703 W Smith Valley Rd)\n# city (150346, object, Tampa)\n# state (150346, object, TN)\n# postal\\_code (150346, object, 46227)\n# latitude (150346, float64, 43.5939441)\n# longitude (150346, float64, -86.2621502)\n# stars (150346, float64, 4.5)\n# review\\_count (150346, int64, 21)\n# is\\_open (150346, int64, 1)\n# attributes (136602, object, {'ByAppointmentOnly': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'})\n# categories (150243, object, Pizza, Restaurants, Food)\n# hours (127123, object, {'Monday': '12:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '12:0-0:0', 'Friday': '12:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-0:0'})\n\n[Markdown]\n# Exploratory Visual Analysis\n\n## Initial Questions\n\n1.

{"timestamp": 11088, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 906, "Output Length": 179, "prompt": "Later in the protocol, the therapist draws from knowledge of the patient\u2019s unique attachment history to suggest specific attachment-promoting qualities if they do not appear spontaneously in the patient\u2019s imagery.\n\nAs is clear from above, practice of the Ideal Parent Figure protocol incorporates the principle of the therapist\u2019s stance as a good attachment figure. But from that interpersonal ground, it goes further by using specific methods that selectively and more efficiently develop and enhance the structural foundations of secure attachment. The remainder of this chapter presents, explains, and provides examples of the Ideal Parent Figure process. Of particular note is that this process neither offers nor condones preestablished scripts. It is most effective when the therapist\u2019s thorough understanding of the underlying principles leads to fresh expression and response during each session with each particular patient. Exemplars given in the sections below are not to be taken literally, but rather are offered as suggestions based on the purposes and goals of each component of the protocol.\n\nThe Foundational Protocol\n\nSETTING THE THERAPEUTIC GROUND\n\nFocus awareness inward. The therapist begins the IPF protocol by helping the patient to establish a calm, relaxed, inwardly focused state of awareness. Such a state increases the likelihood of greater vividness of imagery and decreases the interference of distractions. Ideally, attention is brought to the body, and a positive body feeling and focus is established. During the critical period of attachment formation, 12 to 20 months, identity is primarily body-based and memory is behavioral/enacted rather than mental/narrative. Thus, enhancing the patient\u2019s engagement with his or her immediate body experience establishes the most fertile ground for the evoked ideal parent imagery to take root as a new attachment representation. An example of how this state might be established is as follows:\n\nTake a few moments to settle comfortably into your chair [sofa], letting yourself move or shift or adjust the body in any way that supports your growing sense of comfort. That\u2019s right, whatever helps you feel more at ease, more relaxed, more at rest. And as you bring your attention even more to the felt sense of the body, notice that you don\u2019t have to make any effort at all to be supported there by the chair. You can let the chair do all the work. Notice how, as the muscles of the body realize that they don\u2019t have to make any effort to support the body, the muscles relax even more, let go even more, and you can feel even more at ease and relaxed.\n\nIt is often beneficial to go further and deeper from here. The decision about how much of this preliminary to provide should be based on the therapist\u2019s assessment of each patient\u2019s state and attachment status. For example, anxious-preoccupied patients, who tend to focus on others\u2019 experience more than on their own, and any patient who is agitated or distracted, will likely benefit from additional guidance toward self-focused, relaxed body awareness. Patients who are highly dissociative, such as patients with DID, who most often have disorganized attachment, will likely enter the preparatory state with little prompting.\n\nReaders familiar with hypnosis will notice that the target state is quite similar to a hypnotic trance, which may be described as a calm, relaxed, inwardly focused state of attention. Therapists who have training in hypnosis may choose to deepen the ground state by applying body-focused hypnotic methods. But any guided focusing on calming, relaxing, and on body experience, such as progressive muscle relaxation, will be effective as a preliminary for the imagery work.\n\nDeepen the inwardly focused state. For additional deepening, we like the simplicity and efficiency of a method originally formulated by Charcot (1886):\n\nAnd now, each time you inhale, let the eyes open fully, and each time you exhale, let the eyes fully and gently close. And as you do that, give close attention to the sensations, the sensations and feelings of the movements of the eyes and the movements of the breath. That\u2019s right, just like that.\n\nThe therapist continues to make supportive, focusing comments, watching closely and matching verbalizations to where the patient is in the cycle of eye movements and breath:\n\nInhaling, opening the eyes . . . and exhaling, closing the eyes.

What do you think?\n\nGender Identity Formation in Non-Binary Youth.\n\nBackground 1\nThe ability to name one's biological sex and differentiate peers based on it is learned in early childhood (Zosuls et al., 2009). \nMost societies have rules and codes prescribed to individuals based on their biological sex, whether male or female (Kozee et al., 2012).\nBy adolescence, these rules and codes are internalised and reach a peak, called gender intensification (Clemans et al., 2010).\nHowever, it may happen that an individual feels a mismatch between their internal experience of gender and the external rules attached to their biological sex. For such individuals, the period of childhood and adolescence is marked by anxiety and confusion (Devor, 2004). \n\nBackground 2\n\nThe interpersonal experiences of gender non conforming youth are often characterised by rejection from primary caregivers leading to a delay in achieving the developmental milestone of identity formation (Mizock & Lewis, 2008; Levitt & Ippolito, 2014a; Steensma et al., 2013). \nSystemic discrimination (Elischberger et al., 2018; Mishra & Negi, 2021; Shaikh et al., 2016)\nLegal support\nHealthcare\nEducational \nOccupational (note that these exist on a continuum)\nGender non conforming youth face unique psychological stressors that make them more vulnerable to mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, suicide, and other physical health outcomes (Meyer,2003; Timmins et al., 2017; Wandrekar & Nigudkar, 2020). \nAims and Objectives\nTo explore the process of gender identity formation of nonbinary youth in India \n\nResearch Questions\nHow do nonbinary youth experience their gender?\nWhat are some important aspects that play a role in gender identity formation?\nDo these experiences shift over time?\n\nOperational Definitions\n\nGender identity is defined as the subjective feeling of belongingness with the assigned sex at birth and accompanying social roles (Steensma et al., 2013).\n\nThe term \u201cnon-binary\u201d is defined to mean anyone who does not conform to the gender binary of male and female. Efforts to define the term have reinforced the generality of it, as individuals who identify themselves outside the gender binary use a range of terms such as enby, agender, gender fluid, gender maverique, two-spirit, transmasc, femboy etc. These individuals may also change the labels they use with time, though the underlying criteria of identifying outside the gender binary remains the same (Kozee et al., 2012; Levitt, 2014). There are a few pointers that help categorise the term:\nAnyone who is not cis-gender i.e. a person born as male identifying as a man, and a person born as female identifying as a woman.\nAnyone who is not transgender i.e. a person born as a male identifying as a woman, hence undergoes social and/or biological transition, and a person born as a female identifying as a man, hence undergoes social and/or biological transition. \nA person who does not identify with the gender binary of man and woman.\nMethodology 1\n \nParticipants for this study will be people who self-identify as \u2018non binary\u2019 and are aged 18 to 23\nRecruiting participants through purposive and snowball sampling. Advertisements on:\nOnline forums for queer people\nSupport groups\nOffline communities \nSemi-structured in-depth interviews via Google Meet\nMethodological rigour and credibility: Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ)\nCBPAR: Making a handbook based on analysis and sending it to participants for member-checking\nMethodology 2\n\nOutcome: \nUsing the data to come up with a handbook for individuals working in the mental healthcare field. Questions such as what it means to be nonbinary, how is that different from being cisgender, and how they can best be gender affirmative will be addressed. \nGuideline 11 of the APA guidelines for psychological practice with gender non-conforming people highlights the role of trans-affirmative psychological services in increasing positive life outcomes for the community. A component of trans-affirmative care is the responsibility of clinicians to familiarise themselves with the lived experiences of transgender individuals rather than expecting clients to educate clinicians. \nContribute to building theory on gender identity formation - lack of theories specific to non-binary youth. Theoretical frameworks regarding this focus on transgender individuals, with a comment that it may apply similarly to other gender nonconforming youth. Not enough literature on this."}]}

And, after that, it is\n36 not to be wondered at if I determined that so\n37 far as lay in my power neither Morgan, father\n38 or son, nor their house, should suffer through\n39 me. They had in me henceforth a firm friend.\n\n31. The main purpose of the passage is to\n(A) describe the business of investing to\nthe uninitiated.\n(B) relate a story about the integrity of a\nbusiness partner.\n(C) tell a story about a bad investment\ndecision.\n(D) show how the narrator became a\nsuccessful businessman.\n32. The passage suggests that a person who is\nnot involved in business\n(A) would have a very hard time making\nmoney on the stock market.\n(B) should always be sure to check the\nvalue of his assets before making a\ndeal.\n(C) might be surprised to learn about the\nhonorableness of some businessmen.\n(D) could easily be taken advantage of by\na dishonest businessman.\n33. Which best explains why Mr. Carnegie\nsaid to Mr. Pierpont Morgan \u201cIn these\ndays I will sell anything for money\" (lines\n8-9)?\n(A) Mr. Morgan had always dealt\nhonorably with Mr. Carnegie in the\npast, so he knew that he would get a\ngood deal.\n(B) Mr. Carnegie was eager to make\nwhatever money he could during the\nfinancial panic.\n(C) Mr. Carnegie was very new to\nbusiness at that time, and eager to\nmake any deal that he could.\n(D) Mr. Pierpont Morgan was Mr.\nCarnegie\u2019s main source of revenue, so\nhe wanted to keep him happy.\n34. Why did Mr. Morgan give Mr. Carnegie an\nextra check for ten thousand dollars?\n(A) Mr. Carnegie had clearly forgotten\nwhat his property was worth, and Mr.\nMorgan didn\u2019t want to take advantage\nof his mistake.\n(B) Mr. Morgan though that Mr. Carnegie\ncould get a much better price if he\nbargained, so he overpaid to avoid\nhaggling.\n(C) Mr. Pierpont Morgan had accidentally\ngiven bad information to his father\nabout how much Mr. Carnegie was\nasking for, but by the time the\nmistake was discovered it was too\nlate to correct it.\n(D) Mr. Morgan knew that if he overpaid\non their first deal, it would impress\nMr. Carnegie and he would be sure to\nget better deals in the future.\n35. What does the passage suggest about Mr.\nCarnegie\u2019s legal rights?\n(A) Mr. Carnegie was entitled not only to\nthe amount originally agreed upon,\nbut also to the extra ten thousand\ndollars.\n(B) Mr. Carnegie\u2019s legal rights weren\u2019t Mr.\nMorgan\u2019s only consideration when he\ndecided to pay an extra ten thousand\ndollars.\n(C) He could legally have sued Mr.\nMorgan for much more than just the\nten thousand dollars, but that would\nhave been viewed as dishonorable.\n(D) His legal rights were more important\nto him than his honor, and so he gave\nup the profits to which he wasn\u2019t\nentitled.\n36. We can conclude from the information in\nthe article that, in their later business\ndealings, the narrator probably\n(A) dealt with the Morgans on good\nterms, and kept their interests in\nmind.\n(B) continued to undercharge the\nMorgans as a gesture of friendship.\n(C) tried to be more careful when\ncalculating what he was owed, to\navoid losing another large sum of\nmoney.\n(D) took advantage of the Morgans\u2019\ngenerosity by charging them more\nthan things were worth."}]}

Write it in narative form as her evaluator with the Danielson framework in minds. include: goals, activities, resources and a timeline. The response should be in paragraph form\n\n Betsy's Evaluation\nPart 1:\nPre-Conference: \nThe teacher has taken steps to ensure a strong connection between reading and their unit on reading, such as using formative assessments and making note of each student's strengths and areas for growth.\nAdditionally, the teacher's commitment to differentiated and collaborative instruction shows they understand the importance of tailoring instruction to meet the needs of each student and promoting student-to-student interaction. This connects to component 1b of the Danielson Framework, which emphasizes the importance of designing instruction to meet the diverse needs of all students.\nThe teacher's plan to assess student learning at the end of the unit also aligns with component 1c of the Danielson Framework, which highlights the need for teachers to have a plan in place to assess student learning and progress. However, the lack of mention of the demographics of the class in the pre-conference notes suggests a gap in component 1a, which requires teachers to understand the context and needs of their students and school. Nevertheless, it is possible that the demographics were noted in the lesson plan.\n\n\u2003\n\nPart 2:\nDanielson Rubric for Teaching: Domains 2 and 3\nComponent Rating Observation Notes\n2a. Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport 3 Teacher gives clear directions to students, moves around the room to ensure engagement, and provides praise and individual instruction.\n2b. Establishing a Culture for Learning 3 Teacher uses cultural norms (students patting legs to signal readiness) and routines (smooth transitions, using a bell to get students' attention) to establish a culture for learning.\n2c. Managing Classroom Procedures 3 Teacher gives clear and explicit directions for activities and transitions, and students follow the procedures smoothly.\n2d. Managing Student Behavior 3 Norms and routines are set. Students show respect for each other and the teacher.\n2e. Organizing Physical Space 3 The classroom has anchor charts and organized shelves, which support student learning.\n3a. Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques 3 Teacher uses guided questions, encourages students to discuss predictions with partners, and asks follow-up questions to further learning.\n3b. Engaging Students in Learning 3 Most students participate in discussions and activities, and the teacher uses praise and individual instruction to promote engagement.\n3c. Using Assessment in Instruction 2 The teacher is shown connecting the anchor chart to the students' post-it notes, but no direct assessment techniques are mentioned in the observation notes.\n3d. Demonstrating Flexibility and Responsiveness 3 Teacher redirects students who started reading without making predictions. She pulls them aside and instructs them to read like a story teller. \n3e. Demonstrating Knowledge of Students 3 Teacher incorporates students reading interest (2 boys read many frog books) and connects that prior knowledge to making predictions. \n\n\n\u2003\nPart 3:\nPost-Conference - \nBetsy was pleased with the outcome of the lesson. The students were engaged and worked in pairs to share their original ideas. Betsy was able to assess student learning by looking at the post-it-notes that the students wrote. During the conference, she highlighted the work of two students, one who made predictions and revised them and another who did not make predictions and only put post-it-notes in the book. Betsy discussed with the class how the student can expand their predictions next time and provided different strategies such as pair work or small group work.\nBetsy used formative assessment throughout the lesson, as described in component 3d of the Danielson Framework for Teaching. She also dedicated time at the start of the year to teaching routines and the use of sound cues to save time. The students were highly effective in redirecting each other when they were off task, showing ownership of the classroom culture. Betsy had to modify the lesson for students who started reading without making predictions and differentiated it for a student who struggled. The shared reading activity got students engaged with a text that they were familiar with, and individual reading allowed students to read at a level that was right for them. In the future, Betsy plans to modify the lesson by adjusting the post-it notes strategy and previewing stories to find potential problems."}]}

{"timestamp": 11435, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1257, "Output Length": 427, "prompt": "Please rewrite the content below as a Saas product marketing with a title\n\nThe Olmsted County planning department in Minnesota was a consolidated agency with the city of Rochester under a single Accela agency from November 2007 until March of 2021, when Olmsted county employed its own Accela agency.\n\nOlmsted County had Accela Citizen Access with Viewable Data and Online Inspections and a low-value Laserfiche connection because the documents were housed in the city of Rochester\u2019s servers.\n\nChallenges Before Integrating Software\nEmployees were double-inputting information into various systems. This is a waste of county resources, and taxpayers would not be pleased that workers needed to take so much effort to do basic tasks. Furthermore, forcing workers to do needless, repetitive tasks is terrible for their morale.\n\nOlmsted was not saving its Laserfiche data in a permanent archival location. Instead, they were hosting the data in the city of Rochester\u2019s servers. In the face of a natural disaster, catastrophic server crash, or other emergencies, Olmsted would not have a reliable backup.\n\nCitizens were growing confused about which jurisdiction to designate during city planning processes. Unfortunately, two local governments were using one site.\n\nThe payment adapter was not accepting payments to Olmsted County and the city of Rochester. The situation only allowed payments to Rochester. Because of this, Olmsted could not serve its community with easy online payments.\n \nOlmsted County was not in control of automation for emails, reports, analytics dashboards, and training.\n\nThe county did not have complete access to users and licenses.\n\nWe determined that Olmsted required software integrations to the following systems:\nTyler Tax System/ iasWorld v2020.1.43 (address parcel owner information)\niNovah Cashier v2.60.189.6 (finance system)\nGIS XAPO (new address parcel owner system Laserfiche v10.4)\nThe system was overly complicated. It involved ten steps along with 14 sub-steps for processing paper and data, which were redundant and took up a great deal of staff time to complete. Sometimes, members of the Olmsted County staff would outright refuse to process this data, leaving all scanning to be done at the end for the administrative team.\nObjectives:\nOlmsted County needed to upgrade and streamline its computer and software systems to meet the public's needs better and allow government employees to work more efficiently and effectively. It needed professional assistance in planning and conducting software integrations.\n\nChief objectives for Olmsted were:\n\nProvide a single system for inputting data to save workers\u2019 time for more pressing tasks.\n\nIntegrate Laserfiche and Accela and the other various systems. Meanwhile, optimize the county\u2019s systems for Accela.\n\nReduce as much as possible the paper and data processing substeps in a cumbersome and overly complex system involving 24 steps and substeps.\n\nEnable citizens in Olmsted County to submit applications online instead of being forced to use surface mail or come into the county offices.\n\nMake a safe and straightforward way for citizens to make their payments online. This is especially of concern in the era of COVID-19. Local governments across the nation have to reinvent the way they interact with citizens, especially since the prospects of future global pandemics are always with us. \n\nDuring COVID-19 lockdowns and efforts to encourage individuals to remain socially distant, allowing people to do as much business as possible online with their government became more important than ever. \n\nAfter all, citizens are already quite familiar with submitting documents and online payments in other aspects of life. Their government should enter the 21st century with upgraded and integrated software systems.\n\nSolution:\nThe solution was to integrate the Laserfiche connector and Accela connector with the systems mentioned above to seamlessly work together to increase automation, employee productivity, and efficiency, and finally give Olmsted county the ability to offer online payments to its citizens. \n\nEffects on the plan review process following implementation and integration were as follows:\n\nWe reduced the time employees spent on file management by 90%. Workers no longer had to manually search for metadata from property records and save documents in as many as 3 to 4 locations.\n\nOur team optimized county systems to Accela.\n\nNow, there is no more need for staff to input the same data twice into different systems. Furthermore, the county does not need to worry about staff members missing or skipping steps in vital processes.\n\nWe resolved 12 of 24 sub-steps the county needed for paper and data processing. We accomplished this by setting up auto-populating information across connections. In this case, we resolved some 50% of process substeps with Accela - Laserfiche integration.\n\nOlmsted County citizens are now able to submit the following applications online:\n\nPlumbing and mechanical\nNew well\nNew septic\nOnline inspections\nWith the new integrations, citizens are now submitting 53% of trade permits online. Furthermore, 66% of new good permits are done online. The county is seeing these numbers grow each month, indicating its success and appeal in the community.\n\nCitizens in Olmsted can now make payments online with credit cards and Echeck. Approximately 46% of individuals who made online payments during the previous four months started their application process. This is an excellent indicator of how well the local community accepts the new online services.\n\nImproving How Local Governments Engage With Their Community\nThe case of Olmsted County illustrates how local governments can better serve their community by deploying state-of-the-art payment and document processing systems.\n\nLocal officials need to understand the benefits of improving their computational infrastructure when it comes to government software integrations. Streamlining processes saves government workers a great deal of time and effort. \n\nAnd it also benefits citizens since they will have an easier time submitting applications before doing new work, such as mechanical or plumbing or installing a new well. Since they can now make payments online, people can focus on their projects instead of dealing with additional paperwork or visits to the Olmsted County offices.\nPlease write in confident tone, technical writing style, English language."}]}

{"timestamp": 11507, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1686, "Output Length": 272, "prompt": "S:\nThe proposed changes\nJudicial selection\nCurrent system\nThe Judicial Selection Committee is composed of nine members. Three of them are Supreme Court judges, two are representatives of the Bar Association, two are Knesset members and two are ministers.[26] Selection of judges to all courts require a simple majority of the Committee, but selection of Supreme Court judges require the approval of 7 out of the 9 members on the Committee, granting essentially veto powers to either the three judges or the representatives of the ruling Parliamentary coalition. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the effect of the current system is one of consensus, in that \"the selection of Supreme Court justices has mandated the consent of the politicians on the [Committee], because a majority of seven of its nine members must support a successful candidate. By the same token, the politicians cannot select judges without the agreement of the justices on the committee. This principle has generally produced a consensus on a slate of new justices.\"[27] In contrast, those who view the current Supreme Court as left-leaning, including Minister of Justice Yariv Levin and Prime Minister Netanyahu, state that this 'consensus' is one-sided: When a right-wing government is in place, its members must compromise with the allegedly left-leaning committee members (the 3 Supreme Court justices and the Bar representatives who, it is claimed by Levin, vote as a block), but when a left-wing government is in charge, supposedly no such consensus is needed. They point to the recent appointment of 61 judges in one sitting of the committee, under the previous center-left government, with no effective way for the opposition to object.[28][29][30]\n\nProposed system\nAccording to the amendments proposed to the Judiciary Basic Law by Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, the Judicial Selection Committee's composition will be changed to give greater weight to the legislative and executive branches of government. The Committee will consist of eleven members, namely the Minister of Justice who will serve as the Committee Chairman, two Ministers designated by the government, the Chairman of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, the Chairman of the Knesset State Control Committee, the Chairman of the Knesset Committee, the President of the Supreme Court, two other judges of the Supreme Court who will be chosen from their fellow judges, and two public representatives chosen by the Minister of Justice, one of them being a lawyer.[31] As a result, since the committee chairmen are usually (though not always) selected from the ranks of the ruling coalition, the government could have complete control over the appointment and dismissal of judges, with seven representatives on the Committee out of eleven members in total.\n\nArguments in favor of the reform\nArguments put forward to justify this change include the following:\n\nAs things stand, members who are not publicly elected officials \u2014 the judges and lawyers \u2014 have a majority in the Committee, and it is impossible to appoint a judge of whom they do not approve to any judicature. Furthermore, it is alleged that the Supreme Court's representatives generally vote in a coordinated manner, and this causes the judiciary's representatives to negotiate with the other Committee members as one unit, with increased negotiating power.[31]\nComparatively, focusing exclusively on the Supreme Court, Israeli judicial selection is exceptional when contrasted with other democratic countries. A 2019 study of judicial appointments to constitutional courts of the 36 OECD countries (supreme courts or constitutional courts) found that 24 out of 36 countries surveyed appoint their judges in a system that grants the power to elected officials exclusively.[32] For example, in the United States, supreme court judges are appointed by the president, with the confirmation of the Senate; in Germany, constitutional court judges are appointed by both chambers of the legislature; in France, the judges of the constitutional council are appointed by the President and both houses of representatives in equal proportion, and alongside them serve former state presidents; in Japan, the selection is controlled by the government subject to ratification through a referendum. This system of exclusive appointment of judges by the elected officials is common to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Norway and more. It must be stated that in Israel, such a system was used during the state's early years and that the judges that established the Supreme Court were appointed by the government with the Knesset's approval.\nOnly four OECD member states, besides Israel, appoint their constitutional court judges without giving the elected officials the ability to appoint the judges: Turkey, Greece, the UK and Luxembourg. However, the UK and Luxembourg are distinct from Israel and most other states in that their judges cannot void parliament's laws, and that the supremacy of the public's values are attained by legislative supremacy. From this, of the 36 OECD countries, Israel's sole companions in giving a veto to non-elected officials over judicial appointed to the highest tribunal authorized to strike down parliament's laws, are Greece and Turkey.[33][32]\nOf the 50 states that comprise the United States, in 22 states, the supreme court judges are elected directly by voting ballot; in another 15 states, the appointments are ratified in a direct vote; four states elect their judges through the public officials and eight states appoint by committees in which the majority of the members are appointed by elected officials.[32]\nArguments against the reform\nThe Kohelet Policy Forum study[32] used to underpin most of the above arguments has been strongly criticized as being selective in its reliance on foreign legal systems. For example:\n\nWhile 31 of the 36 countries in the study have public representatives selecting the judges, in 24 of them, judges are selected in consultation with the judicial system and upon its recommendation.\nFurther, while in most of these countries such a recommendation carries no legal force, in practice it is binding, as the public representatives listen to the judges' recommendations and act upon them. As noted in a study, \"the political culture in these countries is such that public representatives select the judges with the consent and blessing of the judicial system \u2014 a political culture completely different than that in Israel.\"[34]\nThe same study notes: \"The other developed countries, in which there is no appreciable involvement of the justice system in judicial selection, are almost all countries with constitutions. Some have a federal structure of several states, each with its own additional supreme court protecting the residents of that federal state. Most have bicameral legislatures not necessarily controlled by the party controlling the executive branch, and so the government's power is decentralized. Usually judicial selection requires the consent of the government as well as both houses of parliament, and almost always the choice in the legislative chambers requires a large majority (usually two thirds of the votes, and even an absolute majority). In other words, the coalition, which does not rule alone and cannot appoint judges on its own, needs the consent of the opposition as well. None of this exists in Israel, and that completely changes the picture.\"[35]\nThe proposed changes would also grant the government complete control in appointing judges to all courts other than the Supreme Court. The justification for changing the manner of appointing judges to courts other than the Supreme Court is unclear.\nIn addition, the Knesset's Research Unit,[36] in a survey, also presented a very different picture, quoting an OECD report[37] arguing that on the purposes promoted by most democracies is to prevent any single power control over judicial appointment of constitutional court justices.\n\nThe Israeli Law Professors Forum for Democracy, comprising over 100 legal experts and academics in Israel,[38] has published a number of position papers analyzing these reforms, concluding that their implementation would undermine the judiciary's \"independence, subordinate the judiciary to the elected government, and render the separation of powers in Israel an empty shell\".[39]\n\nAccording to Prof. Elise Brezis, director of the Azrieli Center for Economic Policy at Bar-Ilan University, the Kohelet Policy Forum did not attempt to assess the impact their plan will have on the Israeli economy. She compared the plan to a \"pretty architectural sketch with no engineering assessment.\"[40]"}]}

If you were designing a service like this trying to keep participants engaged throughout different stages of prison and licence/community orders, what would you include?\n2. What would encourage you to buy in to the CFO programme at assessment stage? What would put you off?\n3. What would be most helpful to provide in supporting resettlement needs at the early stages of a prison sentence?\n4. What would encourage you to join a CFO wing in a prison? What would make you stay on the wing for the whole CFO programme? What would make you want to leave for another wing?\n5. Peer mentors are a big part of the programme. What would encourage you to sign up as a mentor? What would be the most helpful support to receive as a mentee?\n6. What sort of help pre-release is most needed?\n7. On release, would being met at the gate by someone from CFO be helpful? If so, why?\n8. What would encourage you to visit an activity hub in the community?\n9. What would encourage you to keep going to a hub (e.g. activities, hub culture, building, help available or something else?)\n10. If you couldn`t physically attend the hub, what sort of resettlement support or hub activities would be helpful to provide in a different way? How could these services be provided in an engaging way for participants?\n11. For women participants. Are there particular elements or features of support that you would want included? Please give examples?\n12. Are there other elements or features of support that should be tailored to particular cohorts of participants? Please give examples?\n13. How would you encourage participants to stay engaged or re-engage through the different stages of the CFO programme?\n14. There is a small amount of money ringfenced by CFO to be spent directly on participants to support their resettlement needs. Any suggestions for how this money could best be used?\n15. What is most helpful in supporting participants to engage with mainstream services?\n\nthese are the open questions:\n\n1. Open question: What would be most helpful to you in supporting your resettlement from prison back into the community at each and every stage? (Facilitator adds that this means at every stage of your sentence, through the gate, and with the aim of making a new start.)\n\n2. (A) Open question: Have you heard of the CFO Programme? (This allows the facilitator to see what they know. If they know nothing, then this is a chance to explain the elements of it, e.g., CFO wings, peer mentors, hubs) (B) Open question: Now you know something about the programme, does this sound attractive to you? Would you engage with it? (Facilitator can then explore what they find good, and what they can\u2019t see the purpose or usefulness of, and reflect back to them what they said made for effective resettlement in question 1, thus checking what\u2019s new or what might be inconsistent yet develop with questioning.) \n\n3. Open question: Do you know what peer mentoring is? Have you ever been a peer mentor, or been mentored by a peer? Did this work for you? Do you think it is a good idea? (Facilitator can explain how this is a big part of the programme, what the benefits are, and understand what would get their participation.)\n\n4. Open question: What specific help and support would be useful in the days immediately leading up to release, as you go through the gate, and in your first days back into the community? (Facilitator can add that, as they know, getting this point of transition is critical to future success or failure. So it is important to explore anything around protected characteristics.)\n\n5. Open question: What does the idea of a community hub mean to you? How could we design something that would give you the best chance of success in your future life? (Facilitator can then ask other prompts to generate conversation if it doesn\u2019t happen spontaneously, like: what would be in these centres? What would encourage you to attend? Again, prompts around anything on protected characteristics may be necessary.)\n\n6. Open question: If you were given a budget to spend on the services you needed, do you think this would be good idea so you could tailor what you had according to your resettlement needs? (Facilitator would need to explain they would never hold the cash! But it will help you check out what they really see as important in resettlement, so cross references to other questions.)\n\n7. Open question: Now you know what we\u2019re getting at, is there anything else you would like to add?"}]}

Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.\nSee More \u2192\nThe RESTRICT Act, a proposed piece of legislation which provides one way the government might ban TikTok, contains \u201cinsanely broad\u201d language and could lead to other apps or communications services with connections to foreign countries being banned in the U.S., multiple digital rights experts told Motherboard.\n\nThe bill could have implications not just for social networks, but potentially security tools such as virtual private networks (VPNs) that consumers use to encrypt and route their traffic, one said. Although the intention of the bill is to target apps or services that pose a threat to national security, these critics worry it may have much wider implications for the First Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe RESTRICT Act is a concerning distraction with insanely broad language that raises serious human and civil rights concerns,\" Willmary Escoto, U.S. policy analyst for digital rights organization Access Now told Motherboard in an emailed statement.\n\nDo you know anything else about the RESTRICT Act? We'd love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.\n\nThe Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act is led by Senators Mark Warner (D-VA) and John Thune (R-SD). The pair introduced the bill earlier this month, which is deliberately not limited to just TikTok.\n\nUnder the RESTRICT Act, the Department of Commerce would identify information and communications technology products that a foreign adversary has any interest in, or poses an unacceptable risk to national security, the announcement reads. The bill only applies to technology linked to a \u201cforeign adversary.\u201d Those countries include China (as well as Hong Kong); Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Russia, and Venezuela.\n\nThe bill\u2019s language includes vague terms such as \u201cdesktop applications,\u201d \u201cmobile applications,\u201d \u201cgaming applications,\u201d \u201cpayment applications,\u201d and \u201cweb-based applications.\u201d It also targets applicable software that has more than 1 million users in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe RESTRICT Act could lead to apps and other ICT services with connections to certain foreign countries being banned in the United States. Any bill that would allow the US government to ban an online service that facilitates Americans' speech raises serious First Amendment concerns,\u201d Caitlin Vogus, deputy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology\u2019s Free Expression Project, told Motherboard in an emailed statement. \u201cIn addition, while bills like the RESTRICT Act may be motivated by legitimate privacy concerns, banning ICT services with connections to foreign countries would not necessarily help protect Americans' privacy. Those countries may still obtain data through other means, like by purchasing it from private data brokers.\u201d\n\nEscoto from Access Now added, \u201cAs written, the broad language in the RESTRICT Act could criminalize the use of a VPN, significantly impacting access to security tools and other applications that vulnerable people rely on for privacy and security.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany individuals and organizations, including journalists, activists, and human rights defenders, use VPNs to protect their online activity from surveillance and censorship. The RESTRICT Act would expose these groups to monitoring and repression, which could have a chilling effect on free speech and expression,\u201d Escoto wrote.\n\n(Many VPN companies engage in misleading marketing practices which exaggerate their importance and alleged security benefits. Used correctly, and with a provider that does not introduce its own issues such as logging users\u2019 traffic, VPNs can be a useful tool for digital security).\n\nAdvertisement\nRachel Cohen, communications director for Senator Warner, responded by telling Motherboard in an email \u201cThis legislation is aimed squarely at companies like Kaspersky, Huawei and TikTok that create systemic risks to the United States\u2019 national security\u2014not at individual users.\u201d She added \u201cThe threshold for criminal penalty in this bill is incredibly high\u2014too high to ever be concerned with the actions of someone an individual user of TikTok or a VPN.\u201d\n\nWith the bill\u2019s introduction, Warner and Thune instead pointed to other foreign-linked companies that may pose their own security and privacy issues.\n\n\u201cBefore TikTok, however, it was Huawei and ZTE, which threatened our nation\u2019s telecommunications networks. And before that, it was Russia\u2019s Kaspersky Lab, which threatened the security of government and corporate devices,\u201d Warner said in a statement at the time. \u201cWe need a comprehensive, risk-based approach that proactively tackles sources of potentially dangerous technology before they gain a foothold in America, so we aren\u2019t playing Whac-A-Mole and scrambling to catch up once they\u2019re already ubiquitous.\u201d\n\nSens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Susan Collins (R-ME), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), and Mitt Romney (R-UT) are co-sponsors of the proposed legislation\n\nBoth Vogus and Escoto pointed to another potential solution: the U.S. passing a more fundamental privacy law.\n\n\u201cIf Congress is serious about addressing risks to Americans\u2019 privacy, it could accomplish far more by focusing its efforts on passing comprehensive privacy legislation like the American Data Privacy and Protection Act,\u201d Vogus said.\n\nUpdate: This piece has been updated to include comment from Senator Warner\u2019s office.\n\nSubscribe to our cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.

{"timestamp": 11844, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 891, "Output Length": 233, "prompt": "\"3.0 The Three Cardinal Dimensions\nThe \u2018Looped Filter Theory,\u2019 coined by Richard Sitzgen of the 3rd TOR generation states that \u201cComponents of this universe are layered like a ring of coloured filters, all having a varying impact on each beneath it. They cannot be flipped, and to be flipped would be cataclysm.\u201d This coincides with observations made by TORFMA studies, throughout history, demonstrating that there are realms that mankind cannot always interact with. \n\nThe \u2018Door, Lock, Key and Room\u2019 theory created by the Elven Auristas magic practitioner Gus Philippe frames the three dimensions as such. The Corporworld is the body of the lock, meanwhile the essence of a creature (section 3.0) acts as the key to the door, the Manaworld. However, on top of it all, is the space behind the door, the Duinnworld. This section will briefly discuss each realm in order of least-impact to most impact, and its effects on its subsidiaries.\n\n3.1 Corporworld\nThe least impactful, but most important of the four cardinal dimensions is the Corporworld, or the \u2018tangible dimension.\u2019 This is the dimension in which you, the reader, are currently in. Not only does it act as a bridge between the Manaworld and Duinnworld, it acts as a residence for any creature within the realms. It is proven that life is stunted in creatures with a lessened connection to the Manaworld, hence why mages experience fatigue after long spell-casting sessions. The other realms facilitate the act, whereas the Corporworld is where it all happens.\n3.2 Manaworld\nThe second least impactful but most observed outside of course, the Corporworld, is the Manaworld. Throughout history on various Hubworlds, similarities have been drawn between this dimension and \u2018the afterlife \u2019 in most cultures, but regardless, religious debate is not the purpose of this report. The Manaworld is the resource that facilitates spell-casting, and can be adversely affected by uses of it in the corporworld. A common phenomenon witnessed in locations of mass spell-casting, loss of life or battle is \u2018manaworld deviation,\u2019 where a concavity or simply put, dent, is made in the fabric of the dimension, permitting the welling of Mana particles. If it is a concavity causing increase in density of mana particles, it is known as a \u2018positive manaworld deviation (PMD), and if a convexity is caused making mana particles leave the area, it is a \u2018negative manaworld deviation\u2019 (NMD).\n\n3.2.1 Manaworld Functions, and Mana-Tides\nMethods of entering the Manaworld have been manufactured, but are highly discouraged as the typical essence is incapable of withstanding \u2018Mana-Tides.\u2019 Examples of types of magic that do not simply pull mana particles from the Manaworld, but utilize the very dimension\u2019s functions, include on a basic level, mana-sensory magic, and on a complex level, time magic. While the former poses little risk to the user due to simply linking the senses to the dimension, the latter is significantly discouraged due to the risks on the user.\n\nMana-Tides are a natural phenomenon in the Manaworld that rejuvenate particles roughly every 48 hours. They act as a large brush, or riptide, hence the name, where any particle or essence too weak to withstand it is swept into a sub-layer of the dimension known as the Manaworld Void, from which it is incredibly difficult to return, especially without permanent repercussions to the essence. The Void is unexplored, and undocumented.\n3.3 Duinnworld\nThe most impactful of the three dimensions is the Duinnworld, affecting the Manaworld and consequently the Corporworld. Due to only previous prodigies being able to enter the Duinnworld, the characteristics of this dimension are fairly unknown. It is observed that while duinn functions similarly to magic, it is an entirely independent force that simply has the capability of manipulating mana. Based on information from many generations ago, the Duinnworld is a much more stable, time dilated dimension that actually facilitates the growth of magic aptitude. It can also be assumed that much like Duinn itself, the duinnworld reacts to emotion and has some sort of conscience.\""}]}

You aren't sure how old it is, or whether it can even support your weight.\n\nIt seems to support the Elves just fine, though. The bridge spans a gorge which was carved out by the massive river far below you.\n\nYou step carefully; as you do, the ropes stretch and twist. You decide to distract yourself by modeling rope physics; maybe you can even figure out where not to step.\n\nConsider a rope with a knot at each end; these knots mark the head and the tail of the rope. If the head moves far enough away from the tail, the tail is pulled toward the head.\n\nDue to nebulous reasoning involving Planck lengths, you should be able to model the positions of the knots on a two-dimensional grid. Then, by following a hypothetical series of motions (your puzzle input) for the head, you can determine how the tail will move.\n\nDue to the aforementioned Planck lengths, the rope must be quite short; in fact, the head (H) and tail (T) must always be touching (diagonally adjacent and even overlapping both count as touching):\n\n....\n.TH.\n....\n\n....\n.H..\n..T.\n....\n\n...\n.H. (H covers T)\n...\nIf the head is ever two steps directly up, down, left, or right from the tail, the tail must also move one step in that direction so it remains close enough:\n\n..... ..... .....\n.TH.. -> .T.H. -> ..TH.\n..... ..... .....\n\n... ... ...\n.T. .T. ...\n.H. -> ... -> .T.\n... .H. .H.\n... ... ...\nOtherwise, if the head and tail aren't touching and aren't in the same row or column, the tail always moves one step diagonally to keep up:\n\n..... ..... .....\n..... ..H.. ..H..\n..H.. -> ..... -> ..T..\n.T... .T... .....\n..... ..... .....\n\n..... ..... .....\n..... ..... .....\n..H.. -> ...H. -> ..TH.\n.T... .T... .....\n..... ..... .....\nYou just need to work out where the tail goes as the head follows a series of motions. Assume the head and the tail both start at the same position, overlapping.\n\nFor example:\n\nR 4\nU 4\nL 3\nD 1\nR 4\nD 1\nL 5\nR 2\nThis series of motions moves the head right four steps, then up four steps, then left three steps, then down one step, and so on. After each step, you'll need to update the position of the tail if the step means the head is no longer adjacent to the tail. Visually, these motions occur as follows (s marks the starting position as a reference point):\n\n== Initial State ==\n\n......\n......\n......\n......\nH.....

It's fairly premiums. I'd expect that to work 100 percent of the time and not break easily. The scent I recommend would be quite distinguishable from other sense for similar products in the market. Just something similar, but just a little bit of a different twist to it.\nThere was nothing. I looked at it and thought, don't like the look of that. I've actually looked quite intriguing. There's nothing I would outright say, no, not for me. On the whole, my feelings about it, were quite positive. Like I've said already, it's put on me down to the branding. I don't have an extensive knowledge. However, products of its kind in the market, but the packaging alone intrigued me. There's nothing I'd outright say I disliked about it.\nPredominantly the packaging, the scent also sounds quite interesting in different. It doesn't look overly different in reality to other products of its kind. But at the same time, the packaging and general feel of it and the scent did make it stand out. That's what I liked about it.\nI felt good about it. Looking at it, it's just sort of product I would try. It looks slightly different predominantly from the packaging, obviously in the day, cleaning products or cleaning products, but I know you get what you pay for. Overall positive feelings about the product.\nI think the scent stood out as quite unique, as well as the packaging looked quite cool. In terms of its overall presentation, looking at it alone, I would look at it and go. Just like an intriguing product to try out at least.\nIf I experience this product in real life, I would expect it to be a very fresh smelling, minty fragranced, and quite a stringent, basically non streaky, would actually leave surfaces sparkling clean, no residue, and a lingering freshness.\nI can't say it's a real dislike. But I thought the actual design of the bottle wasn't striking enough. I can understand that this is a product that is used to sell cleaning products in. It's obviously tried and tested good product. But I thought that if it hadn't been some different style then it would have been more striking and more appealing.\nI do actually like the packaging of this product. It gives it a clean, fresh, striking look, which is quite appealing. Which is quite different from the general products that are actually on the market at the moment.\nOverall, I feel indifferent about this product. It is quite eye-catching. Brings your attention to a new product, and if it was on offer than I probably would purchase to try it. But generally, I do buy supermarket brands, own brands because they are cheaper.\nI'd expect a positive experience as I think dettol is a good brand. I'd consider it to have a pleasant smell, to leave everything smelling fresh and clean. I'd expect the color to be clear. I don't expect it to spray easily even when you're down to the last bit in the bottle, spray out a good distance, I would say.\nI don't think there is anything that I actually dislike about it. It does what I wanted to do. I think as cleaning products go. It's got a good sense. Yeah, I can't think of anything that I dislike.\nI liked the products. I felt like it's a brand that I trust. I think it has a pleasant smell for a cleaning products. I like that it kills 99.9 percent of bacteria as well. I think it does what I want it to do, it clean surfaces nicely.\nYeah, I liked the product and it does what I wanted to do, is good at cleaning my surfaces, has pleasant smell. I like this as it kills 99.9% of bacteria. I feel it's brand that I trust.\nI think why I go for Dettol just because I think of it as a good brand for cleaning products. I think normally I always go for a spray that kills 99.9% of bacteria. That was one of the reasons I picked it. I think it says that kills cold and flu viruses. It's not really why I picked it, but I would say that it stands out.\nI think it was the colors, the green and the white that stood out for me with the packaging. The bottle was just basically the same as general household cleaning products. But the actual colors and the design did give it a good, fresh, clean look.\nI would expect it to be powerful to work quickly. I'd expect it to really be a lot different with other products because debtor was more of a household brands. I'd expect better results as other brands.\nI wasn't sure if the coloring like the green was for mold or if it's meant to be an EcoColors in between so I wasn't really sure what that's for also, it looks like something that looks fine at the front but could have a lot of chemicals in it. I think sometimes things try and make themselves seem to be less chemically than they are but other than that, it all seem fine.\nIf I purchase this product in real life, I would hope that it would work just like other sprays that I have, especially the normal that all antibacterial spray that I use. I would like it to be a clear spray. I imagine there might be a slight green or yellow colour into it because of the flavor. I would like it to be clean. I would like it to smell really fresh, without being too strong because they wouldn't want that to add perfume to any surfaces or any of the kids toys that I might be cleaning. I would just like it to be the same height and same size as other bottles I have as well.\nJust at first sight, the only thing I didn't really like, and I've already mentioned this, is that the flavor of the bottle or the fragrance of the bottle was really small print at the bottom. When I want to buy a product, I like to know what exactly the fragrance is and it's probably the first thing I will look at because I am quite fussy about smells, I don't like for example really floral smells. Best one I would have chosen a way because it has such easy, but that' s the only thing I would say about it.\nThis product is antibacterial. Having small children in the house, I think it's important to have everything sanitised and as hygienic as possible. I also like that it looks like a good shape of a bottle with the spray. That it's nice, and slim as well, because, I have a lot of pain and products on my cupboard under the sink. It looks it would slow and really well with the rest of them. I think I would definitely buy this if it was on the shelf in front of me. I would be very interested.\nIf I purchased this product in real life, I would expect it to obviously do its job. I will expect it to have a pleasant smell and not too toxic because I know something's smelt quite toxic and unpleasant and I expect it to be quite colorful like green or yellow or white, see-through whitish. I'd expect to spray quite good. No issues and quite a lot out at once. Because I know some bottles when you spray, you have to spend multiple times to get something out.

{"timestamp": 12036, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 704, "Output Length": 65, "prompt": "Background of the Study\n\nPolitical manifestos are documents used by political parties to present their policies, proposals, and ideologies to the public during an election campaign. The language used in political manifestos plays a critical role in communicating the party's intentions and vision to the electorate. In this context, the use of the active and passive voice in political manifestos can significantly impact the perception of the party and its policies.\n\nThe active voice is a form of grammatical construction in which the subject performs the action expressed by the verb, while the passive voice is a form in which the subject receives the action expressed by the verb. The choice of voice can affect the clarity, emphasis, and tone of the message conveyed by the manifesto. As noted by Halliday (1967), \"voice is an important means of expressing the relations between the participants in the event being described and the way in which the speaker chooses to represent them\" (p. 195).\n\nSeveral studies have examined the use of language in political manifestos. For instance, Kjeldsen and Stubbe (2014) analyzed the language use in the 2011 election manifestos of six major Danish political parties and found that they used similar rhetorical strategies. Similarly, Machin and Thornborrow (2003) analyzed the language use in the UK Conservative Party manifesto of 2001 and found that the document emphasized themes of \"control\" and \"responsibility\" in the language used. However, there is limited research on the use of active and passive voice in political manifestos.\n\nThis study will focus on the use of the active and passive voice in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) 2016 manifesto, a major political party in Ghana. The NDC is known for its social democratic policies, and the 2016 manifesto was its blueprint for development and governance. The study aims to analyze the use of active and passive voice in the NDC manifesto and how it reflects the party's policies and vision.\n\nThe study will use a case study approach, which allows for an in-depth analysis of a particular phenomenon within its context (Yin, 2014). The case study approach is particularly suitable for this research as it allows for the examination of the use of the active and passive voice in the context of the NDC's policies and ideologies.\n\nIn summary, the proposed study seeks to fill the gap in the literature on the use of active and passive voice in political manifestos by focusing on the NDC 2016 manifesto as a case study. The study will use a case study approach to analyze the language use in the manifesto and how it reflects the party's policies and vision.\n\nReferences:\n\nHalliday, M. A. K. (1967).

{"timestamp": 12092, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 767, "Output Length": 75, "prompt": "2.10 (a) To prove that P = PT, we can use the definition of the transpose of a matrix, which states that the (i, j)th element of PT is the (j, i)th element of P.\n\nSince P is a permutation matrix, it has the property that every row and every column contains exactly one nonzero element, which is equal to 1. Therefore, the (i, j)th element of P can only be 1 if the ith row and jth column both contain the 1. But this is exactly the same as saying that the (j, i)th element of P is 1, since we have swapped the row and column indices.\n\nOn the other hand, if the (i, j)th element of P is zero, then the ith row and jth column both contain zeros, so the (j, i)th element of P is also zero. Therefore, we have shown that P and PT have the same elements, and so they must be equal.\n\n2.10 (b) To prove that P can be expressed as a product of pairwise interchanges, we can use the fact that any permutation can be decomposed into a sequence of transpositions (pairwise interchanges). Specifically, we can decompose P into a sequence of transpositions by iteratively swapping the rows and columns to put the 1's in their correct positions.\n\nSuppose that the 1 in the first row of P is in the kth column. We can then swap the first row with the kth row, and also swap the first column with the kth column. This will put the 1 in the (k, k)th position of P.\n\nNext, we consider the remaining entries of the first row and first column. Suppose that the 1 in the first row (excluding the first column) is in the lth column. We can then swap the second column with the lth column, and also swap the second row with the lth row. This will put the 1 in the (2, l)th position of P.\n\nWe can continue this process for the remaining entries of the first row and first column, until we have put all of the 1's in their correct positions. Each swap involves exchanging two rows or two columns, which is a pairwise interchange, so we have expressed P as a product of pairwise interchanges.\n\n2.11. To solve a lower triangular linear system Lc = b by forward-substitution, where L is an n x n lower triangular matrix, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a vector c of length n to zeros.\n2. For each i from 1 to n, do the following:\na. Set ci equal to bi.\nb. For each j from 1 to i-1, subtract Lij \\* cj from ci.\n3. Return the vector c.\n\nThe algorithm works by computing each element of the solution vector c in turn, starting with c1 and proceeding up to cn. At each step, we subtract off the contributions from the previous components of the solution.\n\n2.12. To count the number of operations required to solve a lower triangular system of order n by forward-substitution, we can count the number of multiplications and additions separately.\n\nFor each element ci of the solution vector, we need to perform i-1 multiplications and i-1 additions. Therefore, the total number of multiplications is:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-1 = n(n-1)/2\n\nSimilarly, the total number of additions is:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-1 = n(n-1)/2\n\nTherefore, the total number of"}]}

Update the `onPressed` callback function of the `FloatingActionButton` widget to pass the `_selectedDate` variable as a parameter to the `_showAddCelebrationDialog` function:\n```dart\nonPressed: () {\n  if (_selectedDate != null) {\n    _showAddCelebrationDialog(context, _selectedDate!);\n  }\n},\n```\nWith these changes, the selected date from the calendar will be passed as a parameter to the popup dialog when the floating action button is pressed. The dialog will display the selected date beneath the name field.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you."}]}

Let us also assume that the current energy production is equal to the minimum of the current maximum production and the current actual production. This means that a firm may choose to produce less energy than their maximum possible output in order to reduce costs. The depreciation rate can be a fixed parameter that determines how much of the past maximum production is lost due to depreciation each period.\n\nWe can then modify our equations for energy production, capital returns, and the production function as follows:\n\nEnergy production:\n$E\\_{f,t} = \\min{M\\_{f,t}, A\\_{f,t} L\\_{f,t}^{\\beta\\_{f}} K\\_{f,t}^{\\alpha\\_{f}}}$\n\nwhere $M\\_{f,t}$ is the current maximum energy production for sector $f$ at time $t$ and is equal to the sum of the past maximum production, adjusted for depreciation, and the current investment in energy production:\n$M\\_{f,t} = M\\_{f,t-1}(1-\\delta\\_f) + I\\_{f,t}$\n\nCapital returns:\n$r\\_{f,t} = \\frac{P\\_{f,t} E\\_{f,t}}{K\\_{f,t-1}}$\n\nwhere $K\\_{f,t-1}$ is the capital stock in sector $f$ at time $t-1$.\n\nProduction function:\n$Y\\_t = \\sum\\_f E\\_{f,t} + A\\_t L\\_t^{\\beta} K\\_t^{\\alpha}$\n\nwhere $\\sum\\_f E\\_{f,t}$ is the total energy production in the economy at time $t$.\n\nWe can also modify our investment equations to account for the fact that some of the money invested in energy production is used to negate depreciation:\n\nInvestment:\n$I\\_{f,t} = s\\_f (Y\\_{t-1} - C\\_{t-1}) - \\gamma\\_f M\\_{f,t-1}$\n\nwhere $s\\_f$ is the share of output that is invested in sector $f$, $Y\\_{t-1}$ is the output in the previous period, $C\\_{t-1}$ is the consumption in the previous period, and $\\gamma\\_f$ is the depreciation rate for sector $f$."}]}

First, add the `CoreLocation` framework to your project and request the user's location permission in the `Info.plist` file.\n2. In the view controller where you handle the \"Find Bars Near Me\" feature, import the `CoreLocation` framework and add the following properties to the class:\n```swift\nimport CoreLocation\n\nclass FindBarsViewController: UIViewController {\n  \n  let locationManager = CLLocationManager()\n  var lastLocationUpdate: Date?\n  var currentLocation: CLLocation?\n  \n  // ...\n  \n}\n```\n3.

They're herbs.\"\n\nMei groaned. \"Really, MK? You're getting distracted by plants now?\"\n\nMK shrugged. \"I don't know. It just seems strange. A coffeehouse with an herb garden?\"\n\nMei rolled her eyes. \"So what? It's probably just for decoration.\"\n\nBut something about it kept nagging at MK. \"I don't think so. It looks like they're actually growing things to use in their coffee and food.\"\n\nMei stopped walking and stared at him incredulously. \"You want to investigate a coffeehouse? That's your big plan?\"\n\nMK frowned. \"I didn't say it was a plan. I'm just curious.\"\n\nMei sighed. \"Fine. Let's go check it out.\"\n\nAs they entered the coffeehouse, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods wafted over them. They made their way over to the herb garden, which was growing in a series of small pots in the windowsill.\n\nMei looked unimpressed. \"So, what now? Do we start tasting every herb until we find one that tastes like rebellion?\"\n\nMK chuckled. \"No, I was thinking maybe we could ask the owner if they've heard anything about rebel activity.\"\n\nMei nodded thoughtfully. \"That could work. But how do we make sure they don't rat us out to Spider Queen?\"\n\nMK shrugged. \"We'll have to be careful, I guess. Maybe we can pretend to be tourists or something.\"\n\nMei looked skeptical but nodded in agreement. \"Okay, let's do it. But we have to be careful.\"\n\nAs they approached the counter, a friendly-looking woman greeted them with a smile. \"Welcome to The Black Widow Coffeehouse. What can I get for you?\"\n\nMK hesitated for a moment before speaking. \"Actually, we were wondering if you've heard anything about rebel activity in the city.\"\n\nThe woman's smile faltered, and she looked at them suspiciously. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nMei quickly interjected, \"We're just curious tourists, you know. We've heard rumors and were wondering if they're true.\"\n\nThe woman's expression softened slightly. \"I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. This is just a coffeehouse, and we don't get involved in politics.\"\n\nMK and Mei exchanged a disappointed glance before thanking the woman and leaving the coffeehouse.

My name is Sadid Bin Hasan and I am writing to express my interest in the Masters in Computer Science (Thesis) Program at the University of Toronto. I am excited about the opportunity to further my education in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning at your esteemed university.\n\nDuring my undergraduate studies at Minerva University, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that align with my research interests. One of my most notable projects was in my Simulation & Modeling course with Professor Scheffler, where I was tasked with predicting traffic numbers in London, creating a probability-based animated simulation, and recommending a better Traffic Management System to the London Transportation Authority (TfL).\n\nI also had the privilege to work on a large project under Professor Scheffler, using a global Carbon Dioxide (CO2) dataset to create a probability model that correctly predicted CO2 levels in 2060. This project not only helped me gain a deeper understanding of probability and data analysis but also gave me the confidence to pursue more rigorous courses such as Artificial Intelligence.\n\nIn my final semester, I worked on a Capstone project with Professor Gattegno, using newly-learned AI tools to develop an \"Artificially Intelligent University Recommendation Tool\" for students. The tool was able to help students save time and find personalized university options. This project was not only a great learning experience but also a stepping stone for my dream project \"CrossRoads Initiative.\"\n\nI started \"CrossRoads Initiative\" in my freshman year and carried it through my undergraduate studies. The project aims to connect international university students with high-school students for mentoring and scholarship opportunities. I have experience leading a team, working on real-life projects and have received recognition for my efforts such as receiving \"The Diana Award\" from the UK government.\n\nIn addition to my academic experience, I also had the opportunity to work as a Software Engineering Intern at Minerva Project, where I had the opportunity to work with senior product managers and finance executives to build a better product. During this time, I gained valuable experience in working with real-world problems and was able to apply my knowledge of AI and Machine Learning to improve the product.\n\nI am confident that my background and experience align with the research interests of the University of Toronto's Computer Science program. I have experience working with various programming languages and frameworks such as Python, R, Prolog, PyStan, and PrologX, and a strong understanding of probability and data analysis.\n\nI would be honored to discuss my application further and am looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nSadid Bin Hasan\n\nEMAIL NUMBER TWO:\nDear Professor,\nI hope this email finds you well.

We were ordered to bring him back to the palace, dead or alive.\"\n\nMK's heart races as he listens to the guard's words. He never expected to hear about his past from one of his father's own guards.\n\n\"But something happened on the way back,\" the guard continues. \"We were ambushed by a group of rebels. They killed most of my comrades and freed the Prince. I managed to escape and make my way back to the palace, but I never saw the Prince again.\"\n\nMacaque glares at the guard, clearly not believing his story. \"Why should we believe you?\" he asks.\n\nThe guard looks pleadingly at MK. \"Your Highness, please. I swear on my life, everything I've told you is the truth. I have no reason to lie to you.\"\n\nMK looks at the guard, trying to read his expression, to see if he's telling the truth. He wants to believe him, but he's not sure.\n\n\"What happened to the other guards?\" Macaque asks, cutting into MK's thoughts.\n\n\"They're all dead,\" the guard says, his voice barely above a whisper. \"The rebels killed them.\"\n\nMacaque looks at MK, waiting for his decision. MK takes a deep breath, still unsure of what to do. He doesn't know if he can trust this guard, but he also doesn't want to kill an unarmed monkey who may be telling the truth.\n\n\"We'll keep him here for the night,\" MK says finally. \"But in the morning, we'll release him with a warning not to speak of this to anyone. If we hear that he's lied to us, he'll be hunted down.\"\n\nThe guard nods, relief visible on his face. \"Thank you, Your Highness. I swear I'll keep my word.\"\n\nMacaque nods, clearly not happy with the decision, but respecting MK's authority. He turns to the other monkeys in the camp. \"Everyone, get some rest. We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.\"\n\nAs the group settles down for the night, MK can't shake off the feeling of unease. He doesn't know if the guard was telling the truth or not, but he knows that he's going to have to be more careful from now on. He's not just a prince anymore, he's a leader, and the fate of his people rests on his shoulders."}]}

Since my early childhood, I have been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and have always been drawn to science and exploration. As astronomer Carl Sagan once said, \"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.\"\n\nI still remember the awe and wonder I felt when I first gazed upon the night sky and saw the stars twinkling like diamonds. It was at that moment that I knew I wanted to study astrophysics and unravel the secrets of the universe. As physicist Stephen Hawking once said, \"Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.\"\n\nDuring my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate enough to work with a group of researchers who were exploring the nature of dark matter. I was amazed by the complexity and beauty of the research, and I knew then that I wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in astroparticle physics. As physicist Richard Feynman once said, \"I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say 'look how beautiful it is,' and I'll agree. But then he'll say 'I as an artist can see how beautiful a flower is. But you as a scientist, oh take it all apart and it becomes dull.' I think he's kind of nutty. So I have scientific knowledge, and some understanding of the artistic, but not to a degree that would compromise my scientific viewpoint.\"\n\nWhat excites me most about astroparticle physics is the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology and push the boundaries of scientific knowledge. I am eager to explore the mysteries of the universe, and I believe that a Ph.D. program at your institution will provide me with the necessary tools and resources to do so. As physicist Niels Bohr once said, \"Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.\"\n\nMoreover, the collaborative nature of scientific research and the potential to work with like-minded individuals inspires me. As physicist Albert Einstein once said, \"Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.\" I am confident that I can contribute to the field of astroparticle physics and make a difference in the world. As poet Mary Oliver once said, \"Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?\"\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. in astroparticle physics at your institution and to work with some of the brightest minds in the field. As physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson once said, \"The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.\" I believe in the power of science to make a difference, and I am ready to embark on this exciting journey.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"}]}

The kernel receives the packet and checks its destination address to determine which protocol stack to use for processing the packet. The most commonly used protocol stack for the internet is the TCP/IP stack.\n4. The packet is passed to the appropriate protocol stack, where it is processed by the various layers of the protocol stack.

The Affordable Digital Piano with Premium Features \ud83c\udfb9 - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"[Music] today we've got Roland's RP 107 this is Roland's entry-level digital 88 note piano with lots to offer when it comes to speaker detail love the action we're also going to listen to the supernatural piano sound very similar what they've got now on the gp3 let's get started with this right away [Music] oh [Music] the space that rp-107 is fighting for in the marketplace is a crowded one there are many many options in that sub 1500 US dollar range for an entry-level console piano you've got the KDP 75 and the KDP 120 from Kauai you've got the Yamaha Arias ydp 145 165 kind of flirting around that price range and now with Roland we've got the RP 107 which replaced the RP 102 and so where exactly does this fit in let's first start with the basics the rp-107 uses the new BMC chip and that is driving an updated Supernatural piano engine so this is going to be a very similar piano tone experience to what you might get out of say the fp30x or even the brand new Roland gp3 digital grand piano now we've got this line out plugged in out of the headphone jack because there's no discrete audio jacks out so I'm going to put the headphones on and do just a little bit of playing so you can get a sense of what the piano sound is on this rp107 foreign [Music] thank you [Music] so I find this generally with the supernatural engine not necessarily getting into the modeling because some of this changes but in the sample based Supernatural engine you have this really fat attack right across the range anytime you're in sort of the Forte and up range and that's one of the most characteristic elements I guess of the roll and sound I think this works incredibly well for a lot of contemporary playing I think this works super well as well for jazz because it gives you that that punch that energy behind the note sometimes that that type of attack starts to feel overbearing depending on the type of classical music that you might be playing but only once you get up into a really particularly high range because on the other hand sometimes the lack of aggressiveness you can get out of some of those other instruments I mentioned can be a little frustrating depending on again the type of music that you are wanting to play so Roland definitely giving you something different than any of the other brands in this price range in terms the piano sound foreign [Music] let's also now talk about the action because key action is really important especially for people who are just starting out and chances are if you're looking at this or any of the those other models I mentioned you probably are at the beginning of your journey this is as likely like your first console digital piano possibly the first one was 88 notes and weighted notes so action super important for you if if you fall into that category action and finding one that really connects with you is going to be a really big part of how connected you feel with the instrument but it also leads directly to good development of technique and muscle tone which is important because if you transition then from this up to an acoustic having a digital which is going to ease that transition the best as possible I think is a really big benefit and in this regard I think this is where the RP 107 holds its own and possibly leads the pack this has the PHA for Action in it and the pH j4 action is definitely a professional grade action this action is going into instruments such as the Phantom 08 it's going into instruments like the rd88 it's even in instruments such as their gp3 digital baby grand that was released not too long ago really widely used across the roll and range it has a triple sensor basically it's going to detect the motion of the key really quite well as it sends that information off to either a computer or the internal tone generator it also has escapement or let off which means that about two-thirds of the way down the key you can actually feel a little hiccup and I've you know I make mention of this a lot that little hiccup for me provides just a tiny bit of resistance um that you really only feel when you're playing kind of in the lower Dynamic ranges and that resistance adds just a touch more control in my opinion for me anyway for sure it adds that control and a little bit more realism when you're moving back and forth between this and an acoustic piano when it comes to the action I think the weighting of the key is also very similar to what you're going to find on a larger upright or a small well lubricated baby grand slightly on the heavier side so it's got a great sense of depth it's got a great sense of inertia behind it which I think is good for training your fingers and really lets you be expressive over a big wide dynamic range and then it's it's got nice accurate output thank you [Music] the specs on these speakers aren't very impressive I think they say that they're eight Watts aside which you know if we're just going off off the ink on this um means that this shouldn't sound much better than say a slab a basic you know portable instrument for you know a thousand dollars or something like that however the way that they have done the speaker boxes inside here and also that the way they've designed the key cover is actually linked to how you're hearing the sound because they leave this very intentional Gap right over top of the key cover where you're getting quite a bit of tone coming out the front a lot of detail and they've left distance between the top of the keyboard and the back of the speaker so you're getting some very directed treble that's coming through here so unlike most of the other instruments in this price range that have more powerful but exclusively down facing speakers with really no tone porting out the front this is taking advantage of a more efficient design where even though you are getting a little less bass and you really do notice it it's just it's um it's not that it feels like it's lacking projection but there's just that that lower warmth that you don't quite get like you get on say the kawhi's of this range um but there's way more detail that you're getting out of the speakers so the experience of playing this with headphones and the experience of playing it without headphones is actually a lot closer than what you get on some of the the other models that we've mentioned earlier in this review and you've heard the line out now we're going to actually listen to the speakers so you can get a sense of that so here is the rp107 through its speakers being picked up by two stereo microphones directly over top of my head [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] this comes with the stand and the triple pedal and a bench included so in that regard it is a very similar offering to what the others the interface on this very simple it's not loaded up with a ton of sounds so to me this reminds me a lot of what you would get say out of uh like one of the Kawaii KDP 75s or even one of the original es series I think there's 15 tones on here so it's going to give you some e pianos a few strings the ability to you know layer to those sounds on top of one another some basic but still engaging fun stuff it's only available in this black you can't get it in any other color comes with the music stand as you can see it's also got these little Twigs here that help to keep some of the thinner music sheet music in place this has a Bluetooth midi and Bluetooth audio you can connect it to the rolling piano app as I think we've mentioned a little earlier and that gives you the ability to kind of remote control the various settings as well as access all of the lesson programming in here because there's over 300 songs preloaded most of those are in the form of play along repertoire from some of the most popular method books that are out there so to wrap up this look at the rp107 here's where I think it has a place first of all you need to like the role in piano tone just like if you're buying a Yamaha you've got like the Yamaha piano tone or the Kauai or the Casio or the Korg or whatever it is so that is I think the first thing that you need to fall in love with before any of this other stuff matters it's based off the Steinway D Concert Grand and I know that there are a lot of people who do like the sound and the tone that Roland brings when we get to the action I think the action is an incredibly pianistic properly weighted very nuanced action that you can get tons of mileage out of definitely the first many years of playing even even if you're taking this at a at a very serious level this has lots of runway in which to develop your musculature etc etc and then when it comes to the speaker performance even though this is not going to give you this big Woofy warm base the detail you get out of this console even though they're relatively small speakers facing down because of these front toe ports is really impressive I I was extremely happy to hear the kind of detail and closeness that I was feeling with this piano because that's not very usual normally if you want that kind of super precise detail you've got to put headphones on but I didn't feel the need with the rp-107 so all in all I think the piano experience on the rp107 is as good as the very best instruments in this category and it's bringing a slightly different tone that that some people may really enjoy more than some of the others [Music] foreign [Music] if you want to check out more

{"timestamp": 13122, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2543, "Output Length": 334, "prompt": "Good morning. My healthcare organization participated in an quality improvement program, which affect our revenue. Below is the explanation of how the payment is determined. I need you to help me to understand this policy. I am a \"high-needs\" entity, I am subject to which quality measures? I am in PY2022 now. 1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final\n \n\nreconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1."}]}

{"timestamp": 13233, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2846, "Output Length": 165, "prompt": "Part 3 (acknowledge and wait for parts 4-5) \nHow do people in Paterson feel about events and related information needs?\n\nMost survey respondents (55%) said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to know about events happening in Paterson. Only 2% said \u201cnot at all important.\u201d \n\nMost people (62%) also said that, compared to three years ago, it is easier today to keep up with information and news about the community. Only 23% said it has gotten harder to keep up with local news. This finding stands out, because when we asked this question in other communities, we found more people saying it is \u201charder today\u201d than saying it is \u201ceasier today.\u201d\n\nFocus group participants similarly felt like there are multiple ways of finding out about events and other information in Paterson, but expressed frustration about finding specific types of information and finding information exactly when they needed it. Specifically, focus group participants wished for a place to go for curated and vetted information about what is going on in the city \u2013 both good and bad. This suggests that something like Paterson Info Hub would provide great value. \n\nEvent topics of interest\n\nThe survey respondents listed a couple topics about which they were most interested in events addressing: safety/crime reduction and food insecurity/hunger. These seem to be issues that affect many people in the community, or that people want to help with. After those, nearly half of people showed interest in events about exercise/recreation, housing affordability/homelessness, early childhood education, mental health, and music. The list of topics we asked about, and the percentage of people who said they are interested in each topic, are below.\n\n% of survey respondents who expressed interest in events addressing:\nSafety and crime reduction\n72%\nFood insecurity and hunger\n61%\nExercise, recreation and fitness\n53%\nHousing affordability or homelessness\n47%\nEarly childhood education and before/after school activities\n47%\nHealth care and health services (physical or mental health)\n44%\nConcerts and musical performances\n44%\nPersonal finances\n39%\nJobs and job training\n35%\nYouth and teen programs\n33%\nTheater and arts\n33%\nProfessional development\n32%\nDrug addiction and recovery\n32%\nVolunteer and donation opportunities\n28%\nAcademic support and tutoring\n25%\nSummer camps\n23%\nSmall business support and networking\n19%\nImmigration services\n19%\nReligion and faith\n18%\nSenior services\n14%\nLiteracy\n9%\nEnglish as a Second Language (ESL)\n9%\nFocus group participants had slightly different priorities, though many of the same topics came up; they listed: arts and recreation, religion/bible studies, \u201cgetting into \u2018good\u2019 trouble,\u201d spending time with family, and going out/night life as the topics about which they\u2019d be most interested in attending events.\n\nOrganizations of interest\n\nBecause of Paterson Info Hub\u2019s focus on events, we asked survey respondents and focus group participants to identify any local organization or group that they would be especially interested in seeing event information from, or whose events they have attended in the past. Paterson Info Hub can use this extensive list for targeted outreach to obtain information that they know their audience is interested in. Some of the answers, divided by topic, are below (answers were copied verbatim):\nPaterson Alliance (17)\n\nEmployment\nPrograms that support adults to study in a short program (answer was in Spanish)\nWork and training\nSmall business support and networking\nJob training\n\nHealth\nEvent information from Health Care and Health Services.\nHomecare Options (2)\nAssociation of Health Services (2)\nSaint Joseph Health (2)\nPaterson HMHB Coalition\n\nCommunity services and volunteering\nYMCA\nPassaic County YAP\nCommunity public welfare activities.\nVolunteer organizations (5)\nPaterson Charitable Foundation (2)\nCatholic Charities\nFather English Communication Center\nPaterson Healing Collective\nPaterson family success center\nCommunity service\nNJCEDV\nCoalition Against Violence\nNew Destiny Family Success Center (NDFSC) (2)\nFather English Food Pantry\n4CS [Childcare Financial Assistance Agency]\nPaterson Habitat [for Humanity]\nPoint in Time Count\nOasis (2)\nPaterson Education Fund\nPaterson Healing Collective\nBoys & Girls Club\nCity Green\nEva's Village\nMany 100 African American Women\nPHC\nBugg Foundation\nMonique Latise\nFTI Group\n\nSports and fitness\nSports and recreational activities (7)\nExercise\nOutdoor activities\nPlanet Fitness\nFitness community\nPaterson Sports\nNational Parks Service21\n\nGovernment and civil society\nLocal government\nLibrary, Paterson City government\nPaterson Council Meetings\nPassaic County meetings \nLibrary events\n\nArts and culture\nPaterson Creations\nPaterson Apricot Fiesta\nOhana Comic Con\nPortuguese festas rock\nPaterson Music Project\nDrama and the Arts\nAny arts or education organizations, especially ones that work with the public schools\nMusic performances (5)\nMuseum\nCurrent affairs information, hot news, reading and learning\n\nOther\nDigital Press Videogames (2)\nflea markets\nnorthjersey.com\nReasons people go to events\n\nIn addition to organizations of interest, we asked what factors motivate people to attend an event. The greatest share of survey respondents (more than half) said that they attend events that \u201chelp me solve everyday problems in my life\u201d and that \u201cconnect me to friends and neighbors.\u201d Paterson Info Hub can emphasize these types of events in their calendar \u2014 focusing on utility and connection. More than 4 in 10 people also said they choose events that provide civic information, are entertaining, or help with jobs (see percentages below). This led us to suggest that they consider making their events calendar filterable by some of these reasons that readers might be seeking (see full list of recommendations at the end of this section).\n\nReasons survey respondents reported attending local events (multiple reasons could be chosen, so the total percentage equals > 100%)\nThey help me solve everyday problems in my life\n53%\nThey connect me to friends and neighbors\n52%\nThey help me stay informed and be a better citizen\n44%\nThey are entertaining or relaxing\n44%\nThey help me with my job\n41%\nThey help me save money or buy things I need\n36%\nThey help me spend time with or take care of my family\n24%\nIn-person vs. online events \n\nGiven the rise in virtual or hybrid events since the Covi-19 pandemic began, we asked people about their preferences in this regard. Eighty percent (80%) of survey respondents said they are interested in in-person, outdoor events. Fewer people (49%) said they would attend indoor events. About a third (31%) said they would go to online events. Because of the difference of opinion about this among people, we suggested tagging events according to outdoor/indoor/virtual/hybrid, and/or allowing filtering by this variable in the event calendar. \nMethods and sources for events and information\n\nThe Paterson Alliance and the Paterson Free Public Library were already go-to sources of information for those who responded to the survey, probably because the sample was largely drawn from those who are already in their information orbits. The Alliance has a regular newsletter in which it details the activities of its nonprofit members and sometimes highlights other information it deems noteworthy for its target community. Respondents said they use the Alliance to find information every day (20%), at least weekly (49%), or a few times a month or more (79%). This finding suggests that the Info Hub has a solid base from which to build out its audience to the wider community.\n\nThe three most-cited sources by which our survey respondents got their news and information about events was by talking with family, friends, or co-workers; using an internet search engine such as Google; and through one\u2019s Facebook news feed, in that order. Thirty-nine percent (39%) said they use a search engine such as Google daily, and 76% said they do so at least weekly. In total, ninety percent (90%) use Google to find out about local events at least a few times a month. We therefore suggested that Paterson Info Hub prioritize search-engine optimization (SEO).\n\nAnother important channel among respondents (both survey and focus group) was Facebook. More people said they use their Facebook News Feed every day (42%) to find information about news and local events than any other method we asked about. Nearly 80% use it for this purpose at least monthly. Facebook Groups were also popular \u2014 with less everyday usage for events information (29%) but still 79% using Groups at least monthly. This suggests that Paterson Info Hub should be active on Facebook.\n\nThere are many other methods people use less often, but still commonly, to find information about local news and events: TikTok, Twitter and Instagram; local television news broadcasts and websites; local email newsletters; and local news media including Paterson Press, Paterson Times, TAPinto Paterson, and radio news. The graphic below shows patterns of usage for all of the information sources we asked about.\n\nMost-trusted sources\n\nWe also asked people to name any person or organization they \u201ctrust the most\u201d to give them information about local news and events. Many people (12) cited the Paterson Alliance as a trusted source. Below are some of the other responses. As with the organizations respondents turn to for information, the sources listed by survey respondents as most trusted can be a good starting place for Paterson Info Hub to tap for participation in their content creation (answers are copied verbatim).\n\nGovernment offices\nMayor's Office (Farhanna Sayegh)\nPublic Schools\nNational Park Service\nHealth Coalition of Passaic County\nPaterson family success center\nLocal government\nPeople in government\nLocal police department/law enforcement\nFamily members who work for the government\n\nCommunity groups\nEmails from Paterson organizations that I recognize\nPatterson Charitable Foundation\nTiffany Jacobs\n\nOther sources\nMy family\nTikTok\nMy friends and neighbors\nTwitter\nFamily and friends\n\nNews media\nLocal TV news\nRadio news\nPaterson Times\n\nFocus group participants had similar responses; they reported getting trusted information from friends and family, from social media, and from email lists, although they also expressed hesitation with getting info from social media in terms of whether it is trustworthy.\nRecommendations given to Paterson Info Hub\n\nBelow are the recommendations we gave, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\n\nThe top two topics of interest for the community members we heard from were safety/crime and food (in)security, which do not readily lend themselves to events, which suggests that a different platform \u2013 perhaps an email newsletter or dedicated website \u2013 may be of more interest to those community members who want to hear about these topics.\nHowever, nearly half of people showed interest in events about exercise/recreation, housing affordability/homelessness, early childhood education, mental health, and music. This list of topics lends itself well to a shared calendar. In addition, the greatest share of survey respondents (more than half) said that they attend events that \u201chelp me solve everyday problems in my life\u201d and that \u201cconnect me to friends and neighbors.\u201d You can emphasize these types of events in your calendar \u2014 focusing on utility and connection. \n\nThere is a long list of trusted organizations in Paterson; consider collaborating with these organizations on a calendar or news outlet (beyond just asking them to contribute content), so that trust is built in from the beginning. You may also tap people/offices on the list of most trusted sources.\nEngage to a greater extent on Facebook, and be present on Facebook groups that are relevant in Paterson; this is where most of the traffic is and where you\u2019ll have the greatest visibility.\nPaterson is extremely diverse; take advantage of this diversity by offering your content in as many relevant languages as possible, but especially Spanish and Arabic.\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, Paterson Info Hub decided to make the following changes:\n\nHire a translator and make the event calendar available in both English and Spanish (other languages as resources become available).\nHire part-time help to engage in promotion and outreach to raise awareness about the calendar.\nMake printed flyers and posters to raise awareness about the calendar.\nHire a developer to improve the online user experience of the calendar\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them whether they had seen any of the promotion material, or noticed the improvement to the calendar. We also asked them to identify which among the events they saw listed they\u2019d be most likely to attend, and the topics of events they\u2019d like to see more of. They were also asked for general feedback in an open-ended question.\n\nThough the sample was small, even after several reminders (N=9), those who did respond were largely enthusiastic and gave constructive feedback. Those who had heard about the calendar already reported seeing it promoted on Facebook, or through the Alliance\u2019s newsletter, as well as by word of mouth. Six of nine said they would definitely attend an event they\u2019d seen advertised there (the other three said \u201cmaybe\u201d). The topics that interested the respondents the most ranged from food insecurity to health and well-being, and several expressed interest in events that were free and cater to children. Almost all respondents reported finding out about events from Facebook News Feed and friends and family, reinforcing the need for Paterson Info Hub to be active on Facebook to generate buzz in the community."}]}
{"timestamp": 13245, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3305, "Output Length": 248, "prompt": "CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n Special Conditions\n From Jeremy\nI find this material fascinating but you don\u2019t have to read it unless you have one of the headlined conditions. This is an effort to give some help to people with serious conditions who are likely to need medical help, or at least some level of medical supervision as well as \u201cbook help.\u201d \nThere are some more extreme or special conditions causing back pain for which you are going to want to receive individual guidance from a physician but for which you may also get substantial help from the book. Here and elsewhere, you may ask: If I have to go to a therapist for this anyway, why not leave it all to him or her? The answer is twofold. First, the concepts and exercises in the book will give you a great foundation on which to build the more specific treatments suggested by your caregiver. But, second, in my experience, too many therapists treating these conditions jump right into the specific exercises and stretches for these conditions without building an adequate foundation of spine health and strength. That\u2019s what this book does. \nSo . . . get started with this book and then seek out specific treatment. But be alert: Some of these exercises can exacerbate pain for some sufferers. If that happens to you, stop. Sorry that this is so complicated. You are almost always going to get substantial help from the general advice you have already read but\u2014for these special conditions\u2014you will also benefit from the specific advice in this chapter. See your doctor and strike your own balance between medical help and the advice we offer here. It is a two-sided approach and\u2014often with these special conditions\u2014both can help. Typically, the medical help alone\u2014great relief though it may be\u2014is not going to provide a complete, permanent solution. \nDisc Herniations\nThis means a burst disc and it is very serious business, as you already know. You should start by seeing a medical doctor. If a doctor has told you that you should try conservative (that is, nonintrusive) care for a herniated disc but you are in too much pain to start this book, you may benefit from a steroid injection to calm the pain down. I am slow to recommend that step, but this may be one of the situations where it makes sense. Sometimes an injection can bring the pain and inflammation down to a tolerable level so that rehab exercises can be undertaken. You should be warned that steroid injections can slow the healing process of a herniated disc. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of a steroid injection.\nIf you are having pain down your leg from a herniated disc, something called nerve flossing can sometimes help. It may sound like a joke, but it is not. Nerve flossing is a technique that attempts to traction or \u201cscrub\u201d the nerve roots as they exit the spinal cord near the herniated disc to remove material that sometimes builds up on them. If there is \u201cstuff\u201d stuck to the nerve roots or nerves (it is likely to be either pieces of disc material or scar tissue), that \u201cstuff\u201d can cause or exacerbate pain, and removing it can help a lot. Nerve flossing can sometimes do precisely that and provide significant relief. Caution: This technique can sometimes cause an increase in pain initially, before it reduces it. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. But it works enough to be worth the shot. There are countless YouTube videos out there on this subject. My favorite approach is Dr. Stuart McGill\u2019s. He has various videos and describes his approach in detail in his books. \nHypermobile Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Pain\nThis pain can be one of the most difficult and stubborn conditions to treat, in my experience. The sacroiliac, or \u201cSI,\u201d joint is the joint in your pelvis where the sides of your pelvis connect with your sacrum. \nThe SI joint is not supposed to move very much in a healthy individual. It is crossed by large ligaments and muscles that keep it taut. SI joints that move too much can cause recurring episodes of severe pain. This commonly starts with a sprain of these ligaments from a hard fall to the buttocks or from giving birth. Once the ligaments are deformed, the SI joint can become unstable. Learning to engage the core and gluteal muscles at the appropriate times can help people with chronic SI pain. \nA medical intervention is sometimes needed. One approach is prolotherapy, an injection therapy whose goal is to tighten up loose ligaments and stabilize joints. An irritant is injected around the SI joint to cause scarring and stiffening of the ligaments that cross the joint, resulting in a more stable joint. In my experience, this works slightly more than 50 percent of the time. Try this book first and see how much relief you get. You will likely get significant relief. If not, consult several prolotherapy practitioners before deciding to try it. \nBefore considering prolotherapy, try these exercises in addition to the ones you\u2019ve already learned.\nIsometric Adduction \nThe goal here is to strengthen the muscles on the insides of your legs without moving the unstable SI joint. You will need a medicine ball, thick pillow, or something similar for this exercise.\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back with your knees bent. Put the medicine ball between your knees. \nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Squeeze the ball between the knees with 50 percent strength, being careful not to lose your core brace. Hold for ten seconds.\nStep 4: Repeat ten reps. Do two to three sets. \nIsometric Abduction\nAs with the previous exercise, the goal is to avoid moving the unstable SI joint. The difference here is that you are working on the muscles on the outside of your hips. You will need tubing or an elastic band for this exercise.\nStep 1: Lie on your back with your knees bent. \nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\n\nStep 3: Wrap the band or tube around your thighs and below the knees.\n\nStep 4: Engage your glutes and move your knees outward about 45 degrees.\nStep 5: Hold ten seconds.\nStep 6: Do ten reps, two to three sets.\n\u201cBicycles\u201d on Your Side\nThis exercise is very challenging to do properly. One of the goals is to keep your leg in the same \u201chorizontal plane\u201d throughout. By this I mean not to let your leg wander up or down if you were viewing it from the side. Rather, keep it steady with the knee and foot in the same position relative to each other throughout the movement.\nStep 1: Lie on your side with your top arm on the floor in front of you for support.\nStep 2: Brace your core.\n\nStep 3: With the movement of bicycle pedaling in mind, raise your top knee up toward your torso and then push the foot out in front of you. Then bring it back behind you to make a big circle at the hip, as if you were pedaling a bicycle on your side. As you bring the leg behind you, focus on engaging the glutes and opening up the front of the hip.\n\nStep 4: Go only as far as you can without moving your back. \nStep 5: Do ten reps. \nStep 6: Then, go the opposite direction. \nStep 7: Push your heel back behind you, engaging the glutes and stretching out your hip flexors as your foot goes behind you. \nStep 8: While moving the leg, do not let it wander up or down. In other words, stay in the same horizontal plane the entire time. \nBulging Disc\nMost bulging discs will heal on their own if pressures are taken off and the bulging disc is given the chance to recover. The most important thing with a bulging disc is to stop irritating it. You will need to limit activities that put the most pressure on the disc. This means doing much less of any activity that involves a seated position (driving, flying, etc.) as well as picking things up with a rounded back and twisting with the low back (golf, tennis, etc.). There are ways to continue to play these sports without twisting or bending the low back. Remember the concept of creep when you are required to sit. Break it up into twenty- to thirty-minute increments if you are required to sit all day. Avoiding creep is even more urgent when you have a bulging disc.\nFor some people, \u201cpress-ups\u201d can help with bulging disc pain. These were initially recommended by Dr. Joseph McKenzie in his McKenzie protocol. His idea was that this exercise helps to shift the disc back into its natural position. \nPress-Ups\nI have seen some people, but certainly not all people, benefit from this. But it is worth a try.\nStep 1: Lie facedown on the floor with your elbows bent and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, palms down.\nStep 2: Lightly brace your core. \n\nStep 3: Here\u2019s the hard part: You are going to attempt to press your upper body up off the floor without using the muscles in your low back. Your arms should be doing all of the work and your low back should be relaxed. If you have a bulging disc and you start to lift your torso up with your back muscles, there\u2019s a good chance they will go into spasm and make things quite a bit worse. \n\nStep 4: Very slowly and very carefully, start to push your upper body up off the floor. If your low back muscles kick in, stop and slowly \nlower yourself back to the floor to start again.\nStep 5: Continue up slowly. Go only as high as you can without your back muscles kicking in and without pain. Hold for ten seconds.\nStep 6: Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position using only your arms. Repeat five to ten reps. These can be done daily. \nStenosis\nSevere stenosis can be a serious problem and you may need medical help. But it is also true that often the things we have taught you so far will help quite a lot. Indeed, they may be an answer, so it is worth a try. We do not hold out the promise of an 80 percent success rate with severe stenosis, but the chances of success are substantial and well worth a try. Cases of mild to moderate stenosis typically respond very well to the approaches presented in this book.\nThe process will seem familiar now. Primarily, it is just a matter of finding (and maintaining) your neutral spine so that the irritation can die down. Once you feel comfortable with neutral spine, start to try walking again. For most people with stenosis, walking for moderate distances can be a problem. Make sure to keep your neutral spine and swing your arms from the shoulders as we talked about earlier. In addition, stop and take breaks and sit down before the pain starts. Eventually try to increase the distance you can go between sitting breaks. With increased fitness and endurance in the core muscles, these times between sitting will get longer and longer. Again, I caution that if you have very severe stenosis, you may be one of the relatively few who need surgery. This is especially true if you have leg symptoms and/or weakness. That said, I have seen countless patients whose MRIs showed moderate to severe stenosis (lateral or central) who were able to get back to a low level of pain and high level of function without surgery. So it is worth a shot. \nFor many with lateral or central stenosis, bicycling can be a great way to get exercise and relieve the back, because of the forward-bent posture when on a bike. Another solution is to do the following stretch to relieve the discomfort caused by stenosis. \nStenosis Relief Stretch\nThis stretch is the knee-to-chest stretch for relief from stenosis. It is pretty simple and often effective.\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back.\nStep 2: Lightly engage your core.\nStep 3: Slowly bring your knees up toward your chest and grab your knees with your hands, pulling your knees into the chest.\nStep 4: Hold and breathe for thirty seconds. \nStep 5: Repeat five to ten times. This can be done throughout the day.\nScoliosis\nIf you have scoliosis, it is important to see a good physical therapist to get exercises prescribed for your specific body. One size does not fit all on this one, so we cannot handle it definitively in this book. Your therapist should take into account the degree of curvature you have in your spine and the cause of your scoliosis and prescribe treatment accordingly. For instance, scoliosis caused by a leg length discrepancy will sometimes respond to orthotics. Severe scoliosis might require a brace. There are various exercises and stretches to apply depending on your body. I recommend getting personal help from a skilled therapist while also embarking on the protocol presented in this book. \nPregnancy \nBack pain during pregnancy is extremely common. This is because of a host of factors including weight gain, hormonal changes, stress, and lack of sleep. It is a great idea, if you can manage it, to practice all of the advice in this book before you get pregnant and during the early stages of pregnancy. I quite understand that you have a lot on your mind during this period (when I wrote this, Michelle and I were less than a month away from having our first child), but doing these exercises will be a substantial blessing during pregnancy and after. Add it to the list. \nHaving made that boast, I have to admit that you will likely struggle with back pain to some extent no matter what you do. But the back pain will be a lot less. One of the reasons you get back pain in pregnancy is wonderfully logical: It is the release of the hormone relaxin. It is released into your body to prepare for the birth by causing the ligaments in and around the pelvis to loosen, which is a great idea if you are about to deliver a baby, but it also leads to instability in the spine and pelvis, and causes pain. It\u2019s a trade-off: It makes the actual delivery easier, but it causes some pain. The more stable and strong you are going into pregnancy, the better your chances of avoiding back pain. But there is this overriding bit of good advice: Regular exercise throughout pregnancy, including many of the exercises in this book (with light weight) can be done safely and will help a lot with back pain. Talk to your doctor about which exercises are safe for you and how much weight you can safely lift in each stage of pregnancy. You might want to bring this book to your doctor\u2019s appointment for guidance on whether the basic exercises are safe for you. \nIs all this worth it, just for the relatively short term of a pregnancy? Yes. First, it is not a short term, not if you are in serious back pain. And pregnancy is tough enough without the added burden of back pain. So give the preceding advice some thought. At some point you may have flare-ups of back pain, no matter what you do. At that point, you may want to find a good chiropractor and/or acupuncturist to help you. But find a good one, one who has had lots of experience treating pregnant women. Follow my general advice about finding such professionals. Then ask specific questions about your particular needs and concerns of their office manager when looking to make an appointment. \nOkay, that\u2019s it for these most demanding \u201cspecial situations.\u201d But I have seen this advice do a lot of good for those in these situations and felt compelled to include it. Again, it is \u201cblended advice\u201d: Use the book and see a medical or other specialized healer. And it may not give total relief, but there is a good chance that it will help a lot. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for."}]}
{"timestamp": 13305, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2460, "Output Length": 314, "prompt": "The 1992 PEP texts: unity in diversity\nConstructing a multi-ethnic vision of the Chinese past\nThe political climate in which these texts were actually drafted was rather different from that in which the 1988 Curricular Outline had been produced. The crackdown that ended the Student Movement of 1989 marked a drastic turn away from the relative liberalism of the late 1980s. The party ramped up calls for strengthening \u201cpatriotic education,\u201d and introduced compulsory classes in modern and contemporary Chinese history at senior secondary level. The greater emphasis on Chinese history was also reflected in \u201cinterim\u201d changes to the 1986 junior secondary Outline for history in 1990. However, when the 1988 draft Outline was formally promulgated (along with the new textbooks) in 1992, there were \u201cfew changes from the 1988 drafts\u201d (Jones, 2005, p. 90; see below).\n\nNotwithstanding her somewhat contradictory assertion that \u201cethnic contradictions\u201d had been solved by the mid-1980s, Wang continued to aver that \u201cthe issue of nationality/ethnicity is a matter of great concern to me in the compilation of textbooks\u201d (2000, p. 11). To ensure that texts were acceptable to all ethnicities, she declared, \u201cthe work of compiling textbooks must have the idea of a multi-ethnic country as its standpoint\u201d (ibid.).\n\nThis agenda was reflected in the account of China\u2019s origins in the 1992 textbooks. While continuing to use the term \u201ctribe\u201d (\u90e8\u843d) to describe the first three Chinese dynasties \u2013 the Xia (about 2070\u20131600 BC), Shang (about 1600\u20131046 BC) and Zhou (1046\u2013256 BC) \u2013 the 1992 textbooks for the first time also used the term \u201czu\u201d (\u65cf, ethnicity) in relation to the Zhou (i.e. \u5468\u65cf) (PEP, 1992a, p. 27). This implied a vision of the Zhou as a distinct ethnic grouping or \u201cnationality\u201d in themselves, rather than as a \u201ctribal\u201d subset of a larger ethnicity. Wang\u2019s later writing shows that she endorsed a multi-origins theory of Chinese nationhood (2000, pp. 220\u20131). She argued that the Xia dynasty was founded by the Huaxia (\u534e\u590f), later regarded as predecessors of the Han, while the Shang originated amongst the \u201cEastern Barbarians\u201d (\u4e1c\u5937) and the Zhou amongst the \u201cWestern Barbarians\u201d (\u897f\u620e). This view differs from the traditional assumption that these three dynasties all belonged to the Huaxia, and thus were all ethnically \u201cproto-Han\u201d.\n\nTo further support this theory of multiple origins of the Han and China as a whole, Wang sought to draw attention to the presence of other ethnic groups around the periphery of the Xia, Shang and Zhou states. The maps used in 1992 to depict the territorial scope of these dynasties incorporated references to these ancient \u201cminorities\u201d. For example, the map of the Shang identified the Quanrong, Qiang, Di and Huaiyi as neighbouring ethnicities, highlighting the multi-ethnic nature of ancient China (PEP, 1992a, p. 23).\n\nWhile 1980s texts had already projected the multi-ethnic reality of the contemporary PRC backwards in time, applying it to dynasties conventionally regarded as \u201cHan\u201d or proto-Han (such as the Qin, Tang and Ming), the 1992 edition took this one step further, defining neighbouring, competitor, \u201cminority\u201d-dominated dynasties or regimes as \u201cChinese\u201d. In previous texts, such entities had been largely ignored \u2013 a neglect Wang interpreted as symptomatic of traditional Han-centrism. In 1992, the lesson on the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 BC) and its conflicts with the Hun (\u5308\u5974) thus not only mentioned the Hun in a section title (\u201cThe Rise of the Hun and the Construction of the Qin Great Wall\u201d), but also featured a new paragraph introducing Hun culture. This discussed their customs and lifestyle, and was accompanied by the image of an equestrian statue of a Hun warrior and a map to illustrate their conflict with the Qin (PEP, 1992a, p. 72).14 Wang argued that the Qin, long hailed as the great unifiers, in fact only united part of Chinese territory \u2013 the Central Plain and the south. She stressed that the unification of the northern grasslands under the Hun was also an important \u201ccontribution to the unification of the motherland\u201d (pp. 206, 222). This reflected Wang\u2019s insistence that \u201cthe history of the motherland was co-created by all ethnic groups\u201d (ibid., pp. 221\u2013222) and that \u201call ethnic groups have contributed\u201d to its \u201cdevelopment\u201d, especially in frontier regions (ibid., p. 54).\n\nSimilar treatment was accorded to the Khitan Liao (\u8fbd 907\u20131125), the Jin (\u91d1 1115\u20131234) dynasty of the Jurchen (\u5973\u771f), and (to a lesser extent) the Tangut (\u7f8c) Western Xia (\u897f\u590f1038-1227), all likewise traditionally regarded as alien threats to the thoroughly Chinese states of the Central Plains (\u4e2d\u539f). The 1992 texts provided more extended coverage of the origins and development of these groups than previous textbooks.15 This enhanced attention to the domestic histories of non-Han societies reflected another of Wang\u2019s maxims: \u201cwrite the history of minority ethnic groups from their own perspectives rather than the perspective of the Han\u201d (2000, pp. 204, 224).\n\nThe 1992 texts thus evinced a stronger and more consistent emphasis on the essentially multi-ethnic nature of \u201cChina,\u201d giving more equal billing to the histories of Han and non-Han polities and cultures on what was now Chinese territory. This principle was explicitly stated, for example in this comment on the commissioning by the Mongol Yuan regime of official dynastic histories for each of the three dynasties that had previously governed its territories:\n\nThe Yuan government organised writing the \u2018History of Liao\u2019 [\u8fbd\u53f2], \u2018History of Song\u2019 [\u5b8b\u53f2] and \u2018History of Jin\u2019 [\u91d1\u53f2] and treated the Liao and Jin equally with the dynasty of the Han nationality [\u6c49\u65cf\u738b\u671d]. This rightly reflected the historical situation then. (PEP, 1992b, p. 133)\n\nEconomic development in the Liao, Western Xia and Jin states was also discussed along with that in the Han/Chinese Song Empire (ibid., pp. 123\u2013149), whereas previously the domestic affairs of \u201cminority\u201d states had been almost entirely ignored.\n\nThe 1992 texts also covered non-Han regimes ignored in previous editions. These included the Western Liao (\u897f\u8fbd), founded by Khitan who fled to what is now western China and central Asia after defeat by the Jurchen Jin (PEP, 1992b, p. 84). The Black Khan Dynasty (\u9ed1\u6c49\u738b\u671d), Western Uyghur (\u897f\u5dde\u56de\u9e58) and Dali (\u5927\u7406) regimes were also discussed for the first time as states co-existing with the Song. Wang observed that \u201cminority\u201d regimes had previously been featured only because of their links with dynasties of the Central Plain (2000, pp. 203\u20134). By contrast, the 1992 texts adopted the line that any state that had ever governed territory falling even partly within the present-day boundaries of China should be regarded as \u201cChinese.\u201d Attempting to legitimate this view, the texts claimed (rather dubiously) that mainstream historians had always regarded the Western Liao as a \u201cChinese\u201d dynasty similar to the Song, Liao and Western Xia (PEP, 1992b, p. 85).\n\nThe heightened attention accorded to \u201cminorities\u201d also extended to their \u201cheroes,\u201d many of whom were now hailed as \u201coutstanding leaders\u201d, \u201cfamous politicians\u201d, \u201coutstanding talents\u201d and even \u201cnational heroes\u201d (the ultimate accolade). Genghis Khan had already been installed in the pantheon of national heroism; in the 1992 edition, he was described as an \u201coutstanding politician and militarist of the ethnic Mongolian group in our ancient national history\u201d (ibid., p. 109). In his case and those of several other \u201cminority\u201d figures, the 1992 texts sought to enhance their exemplary status by recounting stories of their childhoods, emphasizing difficulties overcome on the path to glory \u2013 a common trope of traditional Confucian historiography. A biographical passage on the Jurchen leader Wanyan Aguda (\u5b8c\u989c\u963f\u9aa8\u6253) elaborated on his military skills, ambition and strategic nous, as well as his bravery in the face of insults from the ruling Khitan Liao emperor \u2013 all portrayed as contributing to his eventual defeat of the Liao (ibid., pp. 83\u201384). While military and political leaders predominated, the texts also devoted enhanced attention to artists, musicians, poets from \u201cminority\u201d ethnicities.16\n\nThe 1992 texts were substantially longer than previous editions, largely due to expanded discussion of cultural issues. Eighteen lessons dealt with cultural developments under various \u201cancient\u201d dynasties, up from seven in 1986. This allowed for greater attention to the \u201cminority\u201d cultures. Previous editions had tended to discuss these in separate sections, implying their peripheral status, but the 1992 edition discussed cultural developments periodically, presenting Han and non-Han groups together. For instance, in the lesson on culture under the Sui and Tang dynasties, a passage on a famous Han medical expert (\u5b59\u601d\u9088) was followed by a sentence mentioning a Tibetan counterpart (\u5143\u4e39\u8d21\u5e03) whose monograph had \u201claid the foundations for Tibetan medical science\u201d (PEP, 1992b, p. 49).\n\nSuch innovations reflect attempts by the editorial team under Wang to challenge established notions of Han as civilized and \u201cminorities\u201d as backward. A number of passages stressed that cultural influence between the Han and \u201cminority\u201d groups was mutual rather than unidirectional \u2013 the Han could learn from \u201cminorities,\u201d too. A section on \u201cCultural Communication between the Han and the Huns\u201d emphasized that \u201cthe Han people also learned a lot of things from the Hun,\u201d providing several specific examples (PEP, 1992a, p. 107). An account of the introduction of polo during the Tang dynasty described the sport as having spread to China from Tibet (PEP, 1992b, p. 67).\n\nWang clearly saw her team as challenging Han chauvinist views and fostering instead a more inclusive, multi-ethnic vision of Chineseness. As we discuss below, other interpretations of this historiographical strategy also need to be considered. Nonetheless, the status accorded in these texts to \u201cminority\u201d societies, cultures and personalities was clearly enhanced. The same was also true of the coverage of conquest dynasties founded by \u201cminority\u201d ethnicities."}]}

(a) For matters arising from a consumer debt, a plaintiff who has obtained a judgment shall provide written notice to a consumer at least 30 days prior to a supplementary proceeding in a civil action for the examination of a consumer pursuant to section 14 of chapter 224 or a payment review hearing in a small claims action pursuant to Uniform Small Claims Rule 7(i). The notice shall inform the consumer of the opportunity to submit a financial affidavit in a form prescribed by the court. If the consumer indicates through the financial affidavit that all income and assets are exempt and files it as directed by the court, the court shall acknowledge receipt and inform both parties that the hearing is canceled. Once a signed financial affidavit form indicating that all income and assets are exempt is on file in that case, no further supplementary proceedings or payment review hearings may be scheduled unless the judgment creditor presents evidence of the judgment debtor\u2019s non-exempt income or assets and the court determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that there are non-exempt assets or income warranting the scheduling of a new supplementary proceeding or payment review hearing.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law or court rule, for matters arising from a consumer debt no capias or other warrant to compel the attendance of a consumer shall be issued for failure of the consumer to appear at a supplementary proceeding in a civil action for the examination of a consumer pursuant to section 14 of chapter 224 or a payment review hearing in a small claims action pursuant to Uniform Small Claims Rule 7(i). Instead failure to appear shall trigger the scheduling of a show cause hearing for the court to determine whether a capias or other warrant to compel the attendance of a consumer should issue. No capias or other warrant shall issue to compel the attendance of a consumer without evidence that notice of the show cause hearing was served on the consumer either by signed return receipt or by a sworn return of service.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law or court rule, a consumer that is compelled to attend pursuant to a capias or other warrant shall be brought before the court the same day. The consumer shall be given the opportunity to complete the financial affidavit described in paragraph (a). The capias or other warrant shall be satisfied by the consumer\u2019s appearance in court or completion of the financial affidavit indicating that all forms of income and assets are exempt.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 18 and 20 of chapter 224 or any other applicable law or court rule, no person shall be imprisoned or jailed for failure to pay a consumer debt, nor shall any person be imprisoned or jailed for contempt of or failure to comply with a court order to pay a consumer debt in part or in full.\n\nSection 5. (a) If a plaintiff prevails in an action to collect a consumer debt, interest computed pursuant to section 6C of chapter 231 or section 8 of chapter 235 shall be limited to a fixed rate of interest of 2 percent per annum. A higher rate of interest on the judgment shall not be permitted, including the rate provided for in the contract. Notwithstanding any interest rate specified in a judgment prior to January 1, 2024 the applicable interest rate to be applied by the judgment creditor or its assignee on and after January 1, 2024, shall be 2%. Judgments issued prior to January 1, 2024 with an interest rate other than 2% are not required to be amended or reissued by the courts.\n\n(b) If the plaintiff prevails in an action to collect a consumer debt, the plaintiff shall be entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees only if the contract or other document evidencing the indebtedness sets forth an obligation of the consumer to pay attorney\u2019s fees, subject to the following provisions: (i) if the contract or other document evidencing indebtedness provides for attorney\u2019s fees in some specific percentage, the provision and obligation shall be valid and enforceable up to but not in excess of 15 per cent of the amount of the debt excluding attorney\u2019s fees and collection costs; (ii) if a contract or other document evidencing indebtedness provides for the payment of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees by the consumer , without specifying a specific percentage, the provision shall be construed to mean the lesser of 15 per cent of the amount of the debt, excluding attorney\u2019s fees and collection costs, or the amount of attorney\u2019s fees calculated by a reasonable rate for such cases multiplied by the amount of time reasonably expended to obtain the judgment; and (iii) the documentation setting forth a party\u2019s obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees shall be provided to the court before a court may enforce those provisions; provided, however, that the documentation shall not include materials that the plaintiff has already filed together with the complaint in compliance with applicable court rules.\n\n(c) If the consumer is the prevailing party in an action to collect a consumer debt, the consumer shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, unless the case is voluntarily dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(i) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure or a stipulation of dismissal explicitly provides otherwise. The amount of the debt that the plaintiff sought shall not be a factor in determining the reasonableness of the award. In the alternative, at the consumer\u2019s election, a prevailing consumer in an action to collect a consumer debt shall be awarded the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that the plaintiff would have been entitled to collect if the plaintiff had been the prevailing party."}]}

You are asked by your manager to summarize the discussion from the call as it pertains to Clari and it's offerings and learnings on the current way customers forecast. Ignore small talk and introductions and create a report to share with your manager.\n\nHere is the first part transcript of the call: \"\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:44\nOkay. Cool. Well, if you need my help at all, just let me know. And yeah, outside of that and me curse and curse one of our solution engineers here. So as I was saying to Lizzie, there definitely the brains behind the operation between the two of us. So be good to kind of dive into some of the more. Yeah tactical and detail stuff around the forecasting especially consumption today.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:06\nAbsolutely nice to meet you. Hi, Nathan. Nice to meet you as well.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 09:11\nHow you doing. Yeah. Doing great, man. Doing great.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:15\nExcited. Use case here around your Usage product. Based in Philadelphia. I've been with Clari for about three years and typically focus on Enterprise forecasting, deployments. So we have had a couple customers come through with the consumption use case. And so Stephen tapped me to consult on what you guys are doing, so hopefully we can help you out with Larry.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 09:41\nTrust. So look, I suppose by way of an agenda for the call today, we've got another 35 minutes set aside and thought it'd best just to kind of keep this pretty conversational. I mean, we can potentially jump in and show you elements of clarity as well, if needs be. I suppose the most important thing is that we get a full understanding for how you're currently. I suppose. Forecasting and measuring, but also then hosting data around that consumption piece as well so that we can kind of go away and put together a couple of different options and see if we can find a solution that's going to work for you on that. So yeah, I suppose maybe over to you initially to just give a little bit of an overview. Maybe. Nathan, Lizzie around how you're currently reporting. On that consumption at the moment. And I'm sure Kurt will have a few questions as we go. Or unless Krista was something that you wanted to kind of kick off with.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 10:32\nNothing to present, but if we could start at a high level and just understand the gotomarket approach for that product. And then how you're reporting and forecasting on that that would be very helpful.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 10:47\nYeah, no problem. I'll have a swing at them. So the product in question is called Martrus. So it's. A Payments business. You can see it more as like a fintech play. Not too dissimilar to like revolute or Monzo or you know, some of these kind of popular. He kind of more ewlowerdriven solutions that you see nowadays. So the go to market approaches like our vertical. Across all of our products is within shipping. So when we talk about that, it's like. Transportation Companies that move product by see. On Large tanker, bulk vessels. Right. And so the Martros product is aimed at the seafarers, because that's where the volume is in terms of.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 11:40\nPersonnel.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 11:42\nSo here's what selling to a shipping company. Who are responsible for those seafarers onboard vessels. And really the. Kind of three main products that we would try and sell into a shipping company. One is. The Crew Payment solution. So.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:02\nEvery time you pay your seatbearer, which typically once a month.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:07\nAnd even any of your employees. But more typically, the seafarers is where the value proposition makes sense. We would basically charge you $12 flat on that transaction. Right. Because those seeds bearers are typically getting paid in local currency. So that's a once a month transaction. And then. And this is where it gets a little bit complex. So that's quite predictable. That's a beta B type cell, right. Every Cfare is going to get paid every month.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:40\nPretty.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:41\nThere's then a B to B to C element because of our E wallet solution, which is once you paid those cf errors, they can also take advantage of our E wallet solution. And that helps them send money back home to their families. Right. So if the Cfarer decides to take that up. Then we typically see another $1212. Plus a small amount of fx revenue. So you could say $15 on when they paid or when they make another bank to bank transfer, which is typically like one or two. It's normally one to family back home. Right. And then you have card usage, which is like point of sale atma type transactions on that card. But that's going to be like really small fx revenue, which is tiny.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 13:34\nBut.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 13:36\nIt does make up part of the like the revenue portfolio for ewallet, but again really difficult to forecast people use for it but just want to kind of paint the picture and then the other the other. Part the mantra solution is kind of like whilst we're talking to you, we could also handle your vendor payment. So when you pay vendors. It'll be a same same platform. Ultimately, what are we doing? We're making payments faster with fewer transaction fees. With a much better compliance platform kind of wrapped around it. And again, we're going to find around $15 there per transaction when they pay their customers. So the vendor payments is quite predictable. If the customer give us their volume. We know the fee that we're going to get per, you know, bank to make transfer.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:24\nThe crew payments is quite predictable.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:27\nI just need to know how many crew you got and just confirm you pay them once a month. Is really tricky because that's that B to be to C element. Like, how many times are they gonna send money back home per month. How many times are they going to do atm withdrawals? They're buy a packet cigarettes. So they're gonna go and buy like a new car. Like.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:53\nJust really difficult.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:54\nAnd obviously we're making a few dollars on the fx as well every time they spend. And so, yeah, it's high. The average base that's highly, like. The challenge, as well as the ramp. So if you told me you've got 100 C fairs. Making. One payment, a month. $12 a month. That's quite easy for me to figure out what annually you're worth. Whatever. Right. But on the e wallet side. I don't know when your sea bearer is gonna choose to use it because they don't have to use it. No one can force them to use it if they don't want to. So like if you guys said, hey, we've got this amazing deal with revolution. If you use that card, you get all of these amazing perks. You might say I'm gonna stay with, like, Citibank. I'm not gonna use that. And so you're one less person that they have predicted that's just kind of dropped off, if that makes sense. But you never truly know when they're gonna drop off because there's no light optout or I want to say no. It's just like working with the accounts trying drive the doctrine. So as that ramp piece as well, which is which is which is tricky because we might say in accounts worth 100 grand and we sign them and we only find that within twelve months we found like 30 grand because we didn't get the adoption of the evolve.\""}]}

Elyse has mentioned we've had wildfires and smokes and not being able to go outside. When I worked remotely before I would often split up my day by working at cafes, or libraries or just going for a walk. Of course, that's not as possible now. I can take walks, but that's about it.

If you'd like to share the most surprising thing to you since March --.\nVerbatim Transcript - 37: Yes, sure. I guess the most surprising for me I probably the antithesis to Elyse, is that I am also an introverted person in heart. We had recently moved into an open-office setting, our office shifted. That was completely what I didn't like, at the time, and it was very interruptive. We were close to a large computer lab area where we would ask questions. Being able to set my own timing for when I'm working on projects here, my daughter is also in middle school so having that ability to help her with her projects and step away during the day so I didn't have to have this asynchronous with her, was very positive.

I'll probably look at the one, \"What does the future look like in terms of libraries or in terms of ETDs?\" what have you. I think a larger sense, my hope, in general, is to take a look at how we structure our staff environments and the way we set up interactions and manage projects, things of that nature.

That hopefully that brings about some of those things. I don't think it's going to change overnight necessarily once we all start to get back to a normalization of what we had as our previous lives.

E.g.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 1, 2)`: Dissimilarity `0`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 1, 3)`: Dissimilarity `1`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(0, 2, 1)`: Dissimilarity `2`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(3, 4, 5)`: Dissimilarity `3`.\n- `(0, 1, 2)` vs. `(2, 0, 1)`: Dissimilarity `3`.\n\n\\*\\*Question\\*\\*: What is a good algorithm for finding the ordering of `data` which minimizes the sum of dissimilarities between all neighboring 3-tuples?\n\n### Some code\nHere's a function which computes the dissimilarity between two 3-tuples:\n```python\ndef dissimilar(t1, t2):\n return sum(int(a != b) for a, b in zip(t1, t2))\n```\nHere's a function which computes the summed total dissimilarity of `data`, i.e. the number which I seek to minimize:\n```python\ndef score(data):\n return sum(dissimilar(t1, t2) for t1, t2 in zip(data, data[1:]))\n```\nThe problem can be solved by simply running `score()` over every permutation of `data`:\n```python\nimport itertools\nn\\_min = 3\\*len(data) # some large number\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(data):\n n = score(perm)\n if n < n\\_min:\n n\\_min = n\n data\\_sorted = list(perm)\nprint(data\\_sorted, n\\_min)\n```\nThough the above works, it's very slow as we explicitly check each and every permutation (resulting in O(N!) complexity). On my machine the above takes about 20 seconds when `data` has 10 elements.\nFor completeness, here's the result of running the above given the example `data`:\n```python\ndata\\_sorted = [\n (1, 0, 5),\n (4, 0, 3),\n (4, 3, 4),\n (0, 3, 5),\n (3, 3, 1),\n (3, 2, 1),\n (1, 5, 1),\n (1, 5, 2),\n (1, 2, 2),\n (2, 4, 2),\n]\n```\n\nwith `n\\_min = 15`. Note that several other orderings (`10` in total) with a score of `15` exist. For my purposes these are all equivalent and I just want one of them.\n### Final remarks\nIn practice the size of `data` may be as large as say `10000`.\nThe sought-after algorithm should beat O(N!), i.e. probably be polynomial in time (and space).\nIf no such algorithm exists, I would be interested in \"near-solutions\", i.e. a fast algorithm which gives an ordering of `data` with a small but not necessarily minimal total score. One such algorithm would be [lexicographic sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic\\_order), i.e.\n```python\nsorted(data) # score 18\n```\nthough I hope to be able to do better than this.\n### Edit (comments on accepted solution)\nI have tried all of the below heuristic solutions given as code (I have not tried e.g. Google OR-tools). For large `len(data)`, I find that the solution of Andrej Kesely is both quick and gives the best results.\nThe idea behind this method is quite simple. The sorted list of data elements (3-tuples) is built up one by one. Given some data element, the next element is chosen to be the most similar one out of the remaining (not yet part of the sorted) data.\nEssentially this solves a localized version of the problem where we only \"look \\_one\\_ ahead\", rather than optimizing globally over the entire data set. We can imagine a hierarchy of algorithms looking `n` ahead, each successively delivering better (or at least as good) results but at the cost of being much more expensive. The solution of Andrej Kesely then sits lowest in this hierarchy. The algorithm at the highest spot, looking `len(data)` ahead, solves the problem exactly.\nLet's settle for \"looking 1 ahead\", i.e. the answer by Andrej Kesely. This leaves room for a) the choice of initial element, b) what to do when several elements are equally good candidates (same dissimilarity) for use as the next one. Choosing the first element in `data` as the initial element and the first occurrence of an element with minimal dissimilarity, both a) and b) are determined from the original order of elements within `data`. As Andrej Kesely points out, it then helps to (lex)sort `data` in advance.\nIn the end I went with this solution, but refined in a few ways:\n- I try out the algorithm for 6 initial sortings of `data`; lex sort for columns `(0, 1, 2)`, `(2, 0, 1)`, `(1, 2, 0)`, all in ascending as well as descending order.\n- For large `len(data)`, the algorithm becomes too slow for me. I suspect it scales like `O(n\u00b2)`. I thus process chunks of the data of size `n\\_max` independently, with the final result being the different sorted chunks concatenated. Transitioning from one chunk to the next we expect a dissimilarity of 3, but this is unimportant if we keep `n\\_max` large. I go with `n\\_max = 1000`.\nAs an implementation note, the performance can be improved by not using `data.pop(idx)` as this itself is `O(n)`. Instead, either leave the original `data` as is and use another data structure for keeping track of which elements/indices have been used, or replace `data[idx]` with some marker value upon use."}]}

For the same reasoning which leads us to conclude that world-existence is not a deceptive trick of Mind, justifies equally the certainty that it is no blindly and helplessly self-existent mass of separate phenomenal existences clinging together and struggling together as best they can in their orbit through eternity, no tremendous self-creation and self-impulsion of an ignorant Force without any secret Intelligence within aware of its starting-point and its goal and guiding its process and its motion. An existence, wholly self-aware and therefore entirely master of itself, possesses the phenomenal being in which it is involved, realises itself in form, unfolds itself in the individual. That luminous Emergence is the dawn which the Aryan forefathers worshipped. Its fulfilled perfection is that highest step of the world-pervading Vishnu which they beheld as if an eye of vision extended in the purest heavens of the Mind. For it exists already as an all-revealing and all-guiding Truth of things which watches over the world and attracts mortal man, first without the knowledge of his conscious mind, by the general march of Nature, but at last consciously by a progressive awakening and self-enlargement, to his divine ascension. The ascent to the divine Life is the human journey, the Work of works, the acceptable Sacrifice. This alone is mans real business in the world and the justification of his existence, without which he would be only an insect crawling among other ephemeral insects on a speck of surface mud and water which has managed to form itself amid the appalling immensities of the physical universe. This Truth of things that has to emerge out of the phenomenal worlds contradictions is declared to be an infinite Bliss and self-conscious Existence, the same everywhere, in all things, in all times and beyond Time, and aware of itself behind all these phenomena by whose intensest vibrations of activity or by whose largest totality it can never be entirely expressed or in any way limited for it is self-existent and does not depend for its being upon its manifestations. They represent it, but do not exhaust it point to it, but do not reveal it. It is revealed only to itself within their forms. The conscious existence involved in the form comes, as it evolves, to know itself by intuition, by self-vision, by self-experience. It becomes itself in the world by knowing itself it knows itself by becoming itself. Thus possessed of itself inwardly, it imparts also to its forms and modes the conscious delight of Sachchidananda. This becoming of the infinite Bliss-Existence-Consciousness in mind and life and body, for independent of them it exists eternally, is the transfiguration intended and the utility of individual existence. Through the individual it manifests in relation even as of itself it exists in identity. The Unknowable knowing itself as Sachchidananda is the one supreme affirmation of Vedanta it contains all the others or on it they depend. This is the one veritable experience that remains when all appearances have been accounted for negatively by the elimination of their shapes and coverings or positively by the reduction of their names and forms to the constant truth that they contain. For fulfilment of life or for transcendence of life, and whether purity, calm and freedom in the spirit be our aim or puissance, joy and perfection, Sachchidananda is the unknown, omnipresent, indispensable term for which the human consciousness, whether in knowledge and sentiment or in sensation and action, is eternally seeking. The universe and the individual are the two essential appearances into which the Unknowable descends and through which it has to be approached for other intermediate collectivities are born only of their interaction. This descent of the supreme Reality is in its nature a self-concealing and in the descent there are successive levels, in the concealing successive veils. Necessarily, the revelation takes the form of an ascent and necessarily also the ascent and the revelation are both progressive. For each successive level in the descent of the Divine is to man a stage in an ascension each veil that hides the unknown God becomes for the God-lover and God-seeker an instrument of His unveiling. Out of the rhythmic slumber of material Nature unconscious of the Soul and the Idea that maintain the ordered activities of her energy even in her dumb and mighty material trance, the world struggles into the more quick, varied and disordered rhythm of Life labouring on the verges of self-consciousness. Out of Life it struggles upward into Mind in which the unit becomes awake to itself and its world, and in that awakening the universe gains the leverage it required for its supreme work, it gains self-conscious individuality. But Mind takes up the work to continue, not to complete it. It is a labourer of acute but limited intelligence who takes the confused materials offered by Life and, having improved, adapted, varied, classified according to its power, hands them over to the supreme Artist of our divine manhood. That Artist dwells in supermind for supermind is superman. Therefore our world has yet to climb beyond Mind to a higher principle, a higher status, a higher dynamism in which universe and individual become aware of and possess that which they both are and therefore stand explained to each other, in harmony with each other, unified. The disorders of life and mind cease by discerning the secret of a more perfect order than the physical. Matter below life and mind contains in itself the balance between a perfect poise of tranquillity and the action of an immeasurable energy, but does not possess that which it contains. Its peace wears the dull mask of an obscure inertia, a sleep of unconsciousness or rather of a drugged and imprisoned consciousness. Driven by a force which is its real self but whose sense it cannot yet seize nor share, it has not the awakened joy of its own harmonious energies. Life and mind awaken to the sense of this want in the form of a striving and seeking ignorance and a troubled and baffled desire which are the first steps towards self-knowledge and self-fulfilment. But where then is the kingdom of their self-fulfilling It comes to them by the exceeding of themselves. Beyond life and mind we recover consciously in its divine truth that which the balance of material Nature grossly represented, a tranquillity which is neither inertia nor a sealed trance of consciousness but the concentration of an absolute force and an absolute self-awareness, and an action of immeasurable energy which is at the same time an out-thrilling of ineffable bliss because its every act is the expression, not of a want and an ignorant straining, but of an absolute peace and self-mastery. In that attainment our ignorance realises the light of which it was a darkened or a partial reflection our desires cease in the plenitude and fulfilment towards which even in their most brute material forms they were an obscure and fallen aspiration. The universe and the individual are necessary to each other in their ascent. Always indeed they exist for each other and profit by each other. Universe is a diffusion of the divine All in infinite Space and Time, the individual its concentration within limits of Space and Time. Universe seeks in infinite extension the divine totality it feels itself to be but cannot entirely realise for in extension existence drives at a pluralistic sum of itself which can neither be the primal nor the final unit, but only a recurring decimal without end or beginning. Therefore it creates in itself a self-conscious concentration of the All through which it can aspire. In the conscious individual Prakriti turns back to perceive Purusha, World seeks after Self God having entirely become Nature, Nature seeks to become progressively God. On the other hand it is by means of the universe that the individual is impelled to realise himself. Not only is it his foundation, his means, his field, the stuff of the divine Work but also, since the concentration of the universal Life which he is takes place within limits and is not like the intensive unity of Brahman free from all conception of bound and term, he must necessarily universalise and impersonalise himself in order to manifest the divine All which is his reality. Yet is he called upon to preserve, even when he most extends himself in universality of consciousness, a mysterious transcendent something of which his sense of personality gives him an obscure and egoistic representation. Otherwise he has missed his goal, the problem set to him has not been solved, the divine work for which he accepted birth has not been done.\n\nQuestion: 9370 chars / 1579 wordsThread: 190718 chars / 31202 words"}]}

Mentioning a keyword too often in an article can actually harm your SEO efforts, as this practice is known as \"keyword stuffing\" and can be seen as spammy by search engines.\n\nInstead of focusing on the number of times you mention a keyword, it's more important to write high-quality, relevant content that naturally incorporates the keywords you want to rank for. This means that you should aim to write content that is useful and informative to your target audience, and that provides value beyond just repeating a keyword over and over again.\n\nIt's also important to remember that search engines are becoming increasingly sophisticated and can understand the context and meaning behind the words on a webpage. So, rather than focusing on the number of times you mention a keyword, you should focus on creating high-quality content that provides value to your target audience.\n\nIn general, a keyword density of 1-2% is considered to be a good target for most websites. This means that for every 100 words in your article, you should mention your target keyword 1-2 times. However, the exact keyword density that is best for your website will depend on a number of factors, including the competition for your target keywords and the overall quality of your content.\n\n\nChoi June.H\n[In recent years there have been some great resources on metrics for startups, in particular Dave McClures metrics for pirates and Andrew Chens articles on user acquisition and KissMetrics article on conversion. Over the last few products I worked on I synthesized this into a core model that I found very helpful. Here are some questions I had difficulty understanding early on that led to my approach:\n\\* You notice that your power users all have taken some action (e.g. filled out their profile) so you try to encourage all users to fill out their profile to get them more hooked on your product. Does this actually help?\n\\* You have 24 hours of downtime, the next day you come back up your traffic is down. Will this have a long-term effect you need to worry about?\n\\* You have 100K uniques per day and so does your competitor, but are these 100K people who come back every day or 700K people who each come once per week? Does it matter?\n\\* You turn on a new advertising campaign and see your # of unique visitors per day start to increase, you assume that this will continue increasing so long as you keep the ads running, right?\n\\* You start having email deliverability problems (or Facebook turns off notifications) so you can\u2019t notify users of new activity on the site. The # of unique visitors decreases slightly but you\u2019re not too worried, should you be?\nWhat follows is a detailed how-to for analyzing your product\u2019s customers.\nThe key insight is this: the most important thing is how many unique customers you have, and by implication, knowing what causes any change in this number. And by customers I don\u2019t mean visitors or pageviews, I mean the subset of those people that will be long-term repeat users. Knowing how to measure those customers is the key concept that connects your pageviews, visitors, conversion funnel, retention %s, and all those other numbers you\u2019re collecting and not quite sure how to make sense of. This isthe heart of your products and business\u2019s success.\nHere is the simple model:\n\nThe first step is to figure out how many new customers you add each day and to do this you have to define what makes a customer.\nPeople seeing your product for the first time go through a series of first-time-visitor steps and then start using your product (landing page, registration, inviting their friends, etc). People usually refer to this series of steps as their new user funnel and the end of the funnel is usually some step like uploading their first photo or completing the first level in your game\u2014some core action for your product. But where should your funnel end? This is actually a critical question that a lot of people get wrong; they misdefine the point of transition from a new visitor to an actual customer.\nHere is how to figure it out. First, hopefully you\u2019re already measuring the conversion from each step in the funnel to the next step: 50% of people who see the landing page click the sign up link, 60% of people who start signing up complete the process, etc. Ask yourself, when someone has been using your product for awhile, what count as a meaningful return visit? Say you have a photo sharing website. If someone returns but only looks at one page and doesn\u2019t click anything, that probably doesn\u2019t count. But if they come and get sucked in and view 5+ unique photos, I\u2019d say that counts. Or if they view one photo but they comment on it, that probably counts too. Once you\u2019ve defined a meaningful visit then you need to work backwards and find the point where % chance of a repeat meaningful visit is 95+ %.\nTo switch examples, say you created an online game. After your user completes the sign-up process and takes their first few turns, there is still a good chance they will not return. However, those users who have come back on 100 unique days (where they took a turn on that day) should have a near 100% chance of returning the 101st time to take a turn. Find the point in between where the drop-off hits 5%, meaning 95% of people who reach this point will return. At this point you can call someone a customer. In a game I worked on once, after someone cast 24 spells and had visited the game on at least two unique days, they were hooked. We only lost 1% of these people each day. This point was the end of our new user funnel.\n(Note: if you don\u2019t have a very sticky point like this, you may not have created a high-value product yet)\nThe second step is to figure out when you\u2019ve lost a customer. After you\u2019ve converted them from a visitor to a customer, by definition, you know you have a high likelihood of them engaging with the product again, but even these customers may not visit every single day. At what point have you lost them?\nYou should have an intuition about the interval between meaningful visits that you care about; start there and look for an unexpectedly long gap. In the game I mentioned above most people played every day (it was designed with this intent). A month after launch I grabbed all my customers who had played today and had been around for at least three weeks. I looked at how long of a break these people took. Lots of people skipped a day of playing, many skipped two or three consecutive days of playing, but very few took people ever took a 4 day break and came back again so after 4 days I considered a customer to be dead. For a second example, consider a product like Shazam on the iPhone (it identifies a song you are listening to). I use this product once month. Assuming this is okay to Shazam as a company (meaning that they can still build a successful business on people like me) then their lost point will be much different than with my game. I bet some Shazam users skip a month or two, but if you\u2019ve skimmed four months you\u2019ve probably forgotten about Shazam and have a very low chance of returning.\nCarrying Capacity\nAt this point, every day you know how many customers you gained, how many you lost, and how many total you currently have. With this data you can now calculate your carrying capacity.\nLets say you have 400 new visitors each day (i.e. from Adwords or Facebook Ads) and 50 of them turn into new customers; and of your current customers you lose lose 1% of them each day. Your product will continue to grow until you reach 5000 customers and then it will stop. Why? Because the # of customers you add each day is mostly independent of your total audience size, whereas the # of customers you lose each day will steadily increase until you\u2019re losing the exact same number of customers you gain each day. At this point you plateau.\nOnce you have reached this equilibrium state, if you increase your daily ad spend so you\u2019re acquiring 75 new customers each day you\u2019ll start growing again until you reach 7,500 total customers then you\u2019ll stop. And conversely, if you keep your # of new customers the same but figure out how to get your daily loss to 0.66% you will also grow to 7500 customers and then level off.\nCarrying Capacity = # of new daily customers / % customers you lost each day\n(The reality is a little more complex than this because the # of new customers you get each day is influenced to some extent by the total # of customers you have, but you can tease out those effects later.)\nEnhancing the Model\nThe next thing to understand is where your new customers are coming from. There are 3 possibilities worth isolating:\n\\* This is a brand new person you\u2019ve never seen before (usually from advertising, SEO, or referral)\n\\* This is a former customer you considered lost or dead that has been resurrected\n\\* This is someone who tried your product in the past but never became a customer; now they\u2019ve come back and converted (I call these the skeptics)\nHere is the original diagram expanded. In this picture you\u2019ve added 50 new customers today but you isolated the three different sources (new, skeptics saved, resurrected). You also track the intermediate pools (skeptics and dead customers).\n\ufffc\nThere is one more expansion I find helpful. Within the 5,000 total customers pictured above, some % of those returned today so they\u2019re as good as new. Here is what my full customer dashboard with that addition:\n\ufffc\nVirality\nVirality is the one concept which has the biggest potential to impact this model. Most people look at virality in a simplified way. You take all the new people who tried your product today and see how many friends they brought (either today or on any day in the near future). If 50 people came today and they inspired 25 of friends to come over the next few days then you\u2019re K-factor is 0.5 (each new visitor will bring 0.5 friends). This doesn\u2019t have any impact on the model I explained above. See the 400 new visitors? If your K-factor is 0.5 this just means you only had to buy 266 of them, the other 134 came for free. Correction: You only had to buy 200 of them, the other 200 came for free. I was only considering the second generation of free visitors, but these will bring a third generation, which will bring a fourth, etc. A K-factor of 0.5 means 1/(1\u20130.5)=2 times the number of users you bought will ultimately come. Any K-factor less than 1.0 is essentially just a discount on advertising spend (0.5 equals a 33% discount 50% discount).\nWhat most people overlook is that retention has a huge effect on your K-factor. Sure, most of the invitations people send occur in the first visit or first few days of using a product; this is why you initially spend so much time optimizing your new user funnel and trying to get people to refer their friends as part of this. However, after this first-visit kicker most users who come to love your product and stay around for a long time will continue to refer a steady stream of their friends. This can give you a nice bump to your lifetime K-factor and give you a greater chance of getting it over 1.0.\nNote: In the case that your first-visit viral coefficient is greater than 1.0, things can be very confusing without having a clear model like the one above. You could be converting 0% of your visitors to customers (i.e. all the water going into your bucket is instantly flowing out), but you\u2019re steadily turning up the water since each new visitor is bringing more than one friend. You will see a steady increase in all your naive measurements of success (i.e. unique pageviews and visitors per day) but in reality you may not be acquiring any customers.\nBenefit\nIn closing, lets revisit the example questions I raised at the start. Here is how this model helps:\n\\* You notice that your power users all have taken some action (e.g. filled out their profile) so you try to encourage all users to fill out their profile to get them more hooked on your product. Does this actually help? Without this model its easy to mislead yourself into thinking it helps. You will probably be able to increase the metric but it may just weaken the correlation with power users. However, with this model you just watch your loss % each day and if it doesn\u2019t change then you haven\u2019t had any net impact on retention.\n\\* You have 24 hours of downtime, the next day you come back up your traffic is down. Will this have a long-term effect you need to worry about? Even if your traffic is lowered for a few days, all you have to do is measure your new visitors per day & lost customers per day and you\u2019ll see if your carrying capacity has changed. If it has not changed then you don\u2019t have to worry, you know your traffic will rise back up to your carrying capacity.\n\\* You have 100K uniques per day and so does your competitor, but are these 100K people who come back every day or 700K people who each come once per week? Does it matter? If you\u2019re incorrectly caught up in # of unique visitors per day then this does seem like an important thing. And in fact, if you realize your visitors are not returning as often as your competitors you may even be tempted to spam them regularly because this will increase # of unique visitors each day and can give you the illusion of improving things. In reality a move like this would probably increase your % lost each day and hurt your carrying capacity but you wouldn\u2019t notice this for awhile because the increased # of uniques each day would mask the harm. However, with the model your emphasis is on # of customers not # of visitors. You\u2019ll quickly realize that you don\u2019t care how frequently people visit as a primary factor; if it doesn\u2019t impact # of new customers per day or % of lost per day then you haven\u2019t actually helped your product.\n\\* You turn on a new advertising campaign and see your # of unique visitors per day start to increase, you assume that this will continue increasing so long as you keep the ads running, right? Nope, you\u2019ll level off once you\u2019ve reached your new carrying capacity.\n\\* You start having email deliverability problems (or Facebook turns off notifications) so you cant notify users of new activity on the site. The # of unique visitors per day decreases slightly but you\u2019re not too worried, should you be? This is similar to question 3, it may or may not be important but you\u2019ll quickly be able to tell by focusing on the core numbers. Increasing # of unique visitors per day does not necessarily lead to more total customers.]\nTrim the parentheses so that they are optimized for the term \"carring capacity\" in google seo and reduce the length of the text in half."}]}

ROXIE (16, insightful, insecure, bald) is a typical teenage girl, except\u2026she has Alopecia. Completely hairless, Roxie wears a wig, leaving most her peers unaware of her condition. Life hasn\u2019t been so easy since she lost her hair. Her father ADAM (50) left the family to move to Montauk, leaving DEBRA (40\u2019s, marketing exec, fitness obsessed, anorexic) an emotional wreck. Fortunately, Roxie\u2019s supported by her bestie LIZZIE (16, lesbian). Roxie crushes on MIKE (17, hot) in her gym class but\u2019s terrified he\u2019ll think she\u2019s a freak. It\u2019s near the end of the school year, summer\u2019s arrived. Roxie\u2019s grandmother, LENORE (77, regal) calls Debra from Florida with unfortunate news; Larry, Debra\u2019s father and Lenore\u2019s husband of fifty years, has passed away. She\u2019ll be flying home with the body tomorrow for a weekend funeral.\n\nLenore arrives and makes funeral arrangements. She loves Roxie dearly, and pulls a softer side of the girl out from beneath her bratty teenage veneer. Roxie\u2019s beautiful when she has her wig off, stunning even. Roxie can\u2019t imagine ever showing the world her baldness. Debra\u2019s devastated to lose her father. Lenore was once a famous soap opera actress, leaving Larry to do most of the parenting when Debra was a child. Adam attends the funeral awkwardly but Lenore\u2019s glad he came. He tells Roxie he\u2019s started seriously dating someone up in Montauk, infuriating Debra. That night, Roxie goes to a beach party with Lenore and gets high with the popular kids including Mike, and Lizzie's secret girlfriend ALLISON (17). Everyone\u2019s flirty and fun but when Mike suggests they all go swimming, Roxie freaks and makes Lizzie take her home. (She can\u2019t get her wig wet)\n\nDebra\u2019s work has suffered since her separation. Her boss chews her out for laziness, tardiness, pushing Debra to work harder to improve herself. Debra tries myriad fitness activities throughout the film, and is almost always working out or planning a new diet. At her gym, she meets JEFF (50\u2019s, fit, kind) and oh do the sparks fly. Jeff works at a local Beach Club and offers to give Roxie a job for the summer. He\u2019d also give the family free access to the club. He really likes Debra. Roxie\u2019s not thrilled at first to have to work, but soon realizes Mike and his friends visit the Beach Club every day, giving her ample opportunity to woo from her post at the concession stand. She gives him free snacks, she plays his favorite band on the speakers, etc. Meanwhile, Lenore sticks around, afraid to move back to Florida and live alone. On errands about town, she\u2019s recognized by fans of her old tv show. Everyone mentions how unfair it was when they killed her character, but we don\u2019t know why. She takes Roxie to lunch one weekend at a local diner. Mike, Allison and their friend TARA (16) enter the diner and Mike\u2019s nice enough to come over and say hello/introduce himself to Lenore. Afterwards, we hear Tara gossiping with Mike. She tells him Roxie has alopecia/no hair!\n\nAt the beach club soon after, on a rainy day, Mike comes over to the concession stand to shelter from the storm. He\u2019s really flirty with Roxie, their arms touch, but when he reaches out to feel her hair, Roxie freaks and backs away. He asks point blank if she wears a wig, Roxie lies and says no. Mike backs off, Roxie\u2019s mortified. -- Debra gets closer with Jeff, but has a temper tantrum when Adam calls her to say he\u2019d like Roxie to meet his new girlfriend. Debra seethes. She reads about a popular meditation practice and drives up to Montauk to take a class. LAURA (40\u2019s, hippy) leads the class. Forgive yourself. Forgive your transgressors etc. Unfortunately, Laura is Adam\u2019s new girlfriend. She realizes this outside the studio right after her first lesson. Debra too is mortified, she flees home. \n\nThe three women get into a fight with each other back home, each projecting their frustrations onto the other. Debra blames Adam for her problems, for leaving her alone to raise Roxie, and hates that Roxie wants anything to do with him. Roxie blames Debra for never asking how she\u2019s doing/handling her hair loss. They each say things they\u2019ll regret and when Lenore tries to step in and stop the fighting, they flip out and start shoving each other/screaming. In the chaos, Roxie\u2019s wig gets knocked into a pile of spilled milk! Lenore goes to console Roxie, the two then go to the beach but Roxie doesn\u2019t take her wig! Once there, Roxie\u2019s nerves spike, but Lenore assures her she looks fantastic; they tan and talk. Lenore reveals that when Roxie was a baby, Lenore was diagnosed with breast cancer, and lost all her hair from chemo before finally having one breast removed. She wears a prosthetic to hide the missing breast. Roxie had no idea. To Roxie\u2019s surprise, Lizzie, Allison, Mike, and Tara pass them at the beach. They\u2019re shocked to find Roxie bald, but Roxie\u2019s devastated to see Mike holding hands with Tara! Lizzie knew they were dating and lied about it! Lenore takes Roxie home.\n\nRoxie ignores Lizzie\u2019s calls, and tries to sleep. Lenore and Debra have a heart to heart about their own issues. Lenore wants to be there for Debra. The next morning, Debra apologizes to the family for freaking out the night before, she\u2019s trying to work on her anger. -- Mike approaches Roxie at the concession stand a few days later and tells Roxie it\u2019s super cool she stopped wearing the wig, he thinks she looks great. Roxie\u2019s finally feeling confident.\n\nThat weekend, Roxie goes to dinner, bald, with Adam and Laura. Laura turns out to be perfectly lovely; she compliments Roxie\u2019s beauty. Lizzie surprises Roxie in the bathroom at dinner and apologizes for lying. Allison\u2019s been coming out as bi and things were just really stressful etc. Roxie forgives her. Meanwhile, Jeff asks Debra on a proper date and the two go to dinner, they kiss! Debra\u2019s boss also calls to tell her she\u2019s been doing great work. Lenore spends her evening in a grief counseling group. She finally expresses her sadness and fear of loneliness out loud. When Roxie gets home, she finds her wig and throws it away.\n\nThe next morning, the three women wake up refreshed, anew. They drive to a secret secluded beach where they can tan alone. Lenore takes off her prosthetic, Roxie\u2019s bald, and Debra confident for once. Each alive in their own skin. They drive home singing. The end."}]}

further ahead in life than what you are in right now and there are areas which are lagging no matter what you try and do you just can't seem to fix it this could be in terms of your energy this could be in terms of anxiety this could be in terms of your career you're not making the steps that you thought you would you're not making the money that you thought you would you're not being the dad the partner the husband that you wanted to be if you're just not showing up as the man that you you thought you would be by now this is going to be really really helpful for you you've probably tried everything under the sun in order to fix it but every time you do something every time you make even an inch of progress something just drags you back down and so you work your ass off again to try and get back up to where you want to be it could be financially it could be with your relationships it could be the way that you look and you make a bit of progress and then something drags you back down again and no matter what happens you just can't seem to get everything that you want if that sounds familiar keep listening because I got something for you which is really really simple and is going to really really uh easily help you fix it so okay so I'll switch over to the iPad right now this is a very very incredibly lifelike drawing of a Summoner Mountain down here is you once again very like flag here is base camp and then up the top is the summit okay oops I just erased that up the top is the summit okay I'm just going to briefly outline these Concepts where you are right now you're on what we call the hamster wheel right where you're constantly working your ass off but it feels like you're not really getting anywhere or you're not getting anywhere as fast as what you should be it feels inefficient and it feels like you have a high level of friction right things are just more difficult than what they should be base camp is where you're at Square zero you're at Ground Zero you're just about to start your climb everything's totally neutral and the Summit is where you want to be this is where you're the ultimate Dad this is where you're the ultimate partner or husband this is where you're making the money you're living your dream life this is where everything is great your Health's incredible your relationships are incredible and your wealth is also so incredible right everything is absolutely on song and that's obviously where you want to be and one of the things that we see that prevents a lot of dudes from actually getting to the summit Step One is they don't know what Summit they're actually climbing what is it that they're working towards a lot of guys get confused because there are so many different Summers that we can climb I mean let's think about it you a lot of guys go out and they chase money they chose huge amounts of money they just want to build a massive amount of wealth a lot of other guys want to chase lifestyle some guys Trace Chase drugs some guys chase women some guys Chase there's so many different things that we can chase but what is absolutely certain is that if you climb up an alternate Summit because remember there are millions of these Summits you've got money up here you've got you know drugs over here you've got women over on another one you've got whatever we've got all these different goals that we can chase all these different Summers that we can chase but if they're not in an alignment with what we actually want when we reach them we're going to be totally unfilled and that's where we climb up one mountain we come back down we climb up another we come back down and we never feel like we're actually getting anywhere so the very first thing that we need to do is we need to get clear on well what is my Summit what do I actually want from this life when I'm old and gray and smelly and my Skin's all falling out and I've got tubes up my ass down my throat up my up my nose there's a machine helping my lungs to pump what do I want to look back on on my life how do I want to have envisioned my life so that's the first thing we need to get really really clear on what do we want our Summit to be then the next thing after that that we need to do is we need to get out of the hamster wheel right we need to get off this world because whenever we're stuck here on the hamster wheel we're just going around and around and around and around in circles and we'll never actually make it up the mountain it'll never happen so the first step is that we need to get from here on the hamster wheel onto base camp and what base camp looks like is this you've got no friction there's nothing holding you back those anchors those things which are just dragging you down all the time you don't have them you have incredible energy you have no anxiety you're managing your stress really well you'll never evade stress completely in life but you'll know how to deal with it you're on point physically mentally and you're clear on the direction that you need to go that is what we call base camp and once you get to base camp that's where you can actually start the ascent at the summit see one of the other big reasons why so many guys never actually make it up this Summit is because they're trying to climb on the biggest climb of their life stressed out anxious with low testosterone terrible energy they just feel awful can you imagine climbing Mount Everest and feeling like that it's never going to happen and see the thing climbing to your goal and climbing to your whole life's purpose which is essentially what your summit is it's the biggest climate you'll ever do in your life and it's permanent if you're trying to do that bad boy with no energy stressed out anxious low testosterone feeling awful you're never going to make it and so what we need to do is we need to get you to base camp first where you're feeling really good and then we can begin the climb and so the next thing once we've got you here at base camp what do you need when you're at base camp you need this you need a map if you don't have a map you're never going to make it up the mountain I don't know if you guys have ever done any mountain climb but I've done a fair bit and so it always helps to learn how to actually get up to the top because if you wing it on the way it's really really slow the next thing that you always need is you need a guide you need a sherpa as such Edmund Hillary Sir Edmund Hillary the man the first man to Summit Mount Everest or the first white man I think that was able to Summit Mount Everest he failed twice before he only got it on the third time do you know the difference between the first two times and the third it's the third time you had some sherpets he had a sherbet tensing Norge was his name right who actually helped him guide guide him all the way up the mountain and so what we need if we're going to get from base camp all the way up to the summit is we need to have a map a plan and we need to have a guide on how you're going to get there when you have those two things that is when you'll be able to get to the summit okay and so this is really really incredibly important so what I want you to take away from from this video is this first of all if you want to get to where you want to be if you want to be able to actually make more money if you want to be able to be a better dad you want to be a better partner you want to be happier you want to be healthy you want to feel better well first of all you need to know what the Summit is you need to know where your summit is you need to know what game you're playing not somebody else's game not society's game not someone says hey you should be a doctor you should be making this amount of money this is how you should be as a dad you need to have exactly three kids what game are you playing so it's the first thing Clarity the second thing after that is we need to get you off the hamster wheel and get you up to base camp because when you're at base camp that's when you can actually get up to the top and the third thing is you need a map and you need a guide and that is how you get there you're not just going to wing it on the way up because as there are going to be obstacles as we all know you need to make sure that you have a plan on how you're going to get to your summit and you need to have someone there who's going to hold you accountable and guide you the whole way okay on that note guys I'll leave you all to it if you have any questions as always feel free to reach out I hope this helps\"\nVideo Summary:"}]}

Wurds @ VR Mystery School - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"[Music] uh i'm bubble also known as ali words i have a bachelor's degree in philosophy and i've worked with and written about prometheus rising over the past five years last week we read chapter six the time binding semantic circuit if you missed it look it up on our youtube channel this session will also be recorded and uploaded so the exercises last time did anyone have a chance to try any of that i tried one um incidentally someone left a uh i came across a dvd of a movie called gods not dead and it is a christian film about an atheist professor who does not act like any philosophy professor i ever had um who's like violently atheist and he forces all the students on the first day of class to write like god is dead and this one kid he refuses um because he's like a devout christian and then it's like i didn't get all the way through it because of just like i've been busy lately but he uh it's about his relationship with god and i think the atheist professor at the end probably converts to christianity because he realizes maybe he should soften up a little bit but um so i'm not an atheist myself but it is definitely not the world view that i'm from it's from people that are like violently anti-philosophy whoever wrote that film uh it was very ignorant of philosophy and philosophers and like their arguments for the existence or not arguing for the existence of god just like had no connection with the history of theology like they could have just dropped in kierkegaard and resolved the whole thing so yeah i'm rambling now that's interesting but uh yeah it's good to find like movies are really easy you can find movies that support ideologies that you don't agree with um a good thing to look at that is of historical value is there a lot of um early ussr um cinema that were like avant-garde like they invented the montage so like you learn about the history of film but you also see how they're using it to like glorify the working class um and you can see a very different kind of dialectic good stuff um i had a question you know when i was doing this exercise i did get a short chance for it i find it quite hard to really have something of a new insight i was wondering if you had any like aha moments about this experience that you thought are interesting to share um not with that movie uh so one of the philosophers related to negentropy and accelerationism there's a whole movement now called accelerationism is nick land who is himself or maybe was an occultist he did stuff where he created a decimal based kabbalah system like starting with zero through nine called the pneumogram and it was like also based on like cthulhu and lovecraftian stuff but uh he has moved to china and i'm not totally up to date on him but his works at the very least are used by a lot of accelerationist they call themselves the dark enlightenment philosophers a lot of them are very fascist and racist and there are like subreddits where you can read um where they like post oh is it like the daily mold bug or something i don't keep up with it but uh and they like find articles that support their racist ideas and then they comment about it and it's interesting to see these people i actually read the subreddit for like a month or two like not every day and there were times where i could really feel the emotion and the hurt that some of these people had how threatened they felt and a lot of it is about themselves uh feeling threatened and that's like threatening their second circuit and even their their first circuit especially with the uh rioting that has happened in america this year there there were some telegram groups that i was watching where uh i was looking at both black lives matter groups and also reactionary groups just to compare the intel they were sharing was interesting and yeah it can be an experience watching like the black lives matter riots as they were happening on telegram yeah yeah i did the two sometimes you really feel definitely the different echo chambers and they touch uh here and there sometimes you know like uh even you'll see instances where the same info bit again it gets explained differently in these different groups and exactly each will use it uh just the same way as the other group is to um well fuel the fire of their cause and so on yeah i guess i stumbled yeah exactly like accidentally into this group or a couple threads that had to do with this new meme format which is um again you know relating a lot of mysticism and and philosophy ancient history you know things that are very dear to me and inspire me to do great you know people are putting this together and and sewing it into some kind of a you know ethnic supreme narrative and that's you know it's kind of quite shocking for me to see so then i figured hey let's stick around for a little bit and take a look because well i was going to go try anyway for the exercise but then to see again you know what is inspiring me to open my heart and develop things like empathy and altruism for other people it's fuel on the fire of their um like ethno nationalism and those kind of things it's it's really crazy to think about that i guess that was my my primary insight from from the exercise yeah that's what it was for me really is just having empathy and especially in the more extreme groups that um that you either agree with or you don't um they're all people and a lot of them in the more extreme groups are really afraid is what i've seen in the looking at like the more racist type groups and um you know they they deserve empathy even like anyone everyone does and if you can actually feel their fear even if you come to the conclusion that's irrational i think that that is a valuable human experience the time binding dialectic acceleration and deceleration in the dialectic between nature and the socially constructed world the human organism is transformed in this dialectic man produces reality and thereby produces himself and that is by burger and luckman in the social construction of reality the first and second circuits are evolutionary stable strategies they've worked in more or less the same form not just for primates but for other animals and many other species over vast eons of time the third semantic circuit is an evolutionary unstable strategy it could very accurately be called revolutionary rather than evolutionary the first two circuits are based on negative feedback in the biological sense they maintain homeostasis that is they return over and over to the same ecological ethological balances they function on negative feedback sorry the function of negative feedback is to return to such a steady state the time-binding semantic circuit is not based on such steady-state positive feedback it is a mechanism of what cyberneticists and biologists called positive feedback it does not return to a steady state but constantly seeks a new equilibrium at a higher energy level negative feedback returns to a fixed point like a thermostat positive feedback seeks a moving goal like a guided missile the first two circuits maintain that which is more or less constant in human affairs they are totally cyclical and relate directly to the cycles found in history by vico hegel and similar philosophers assert the third circuit has always been hemmed in and heavily sanctioned with rules laws prohibitions taboos etc because it breaks up such cycles it leads if unleashed to an upward hurling spiral in societies where the third semantic circuit has been partially unleashed it has never been totally freed in any society the upward spiral immediately appears this used to be known as progress before that word became unfashionable the upward spiral whether we call it progress or not is characteristic of what karl popper calls open societies these are secular humanistic societies cultures relatively free of taboo and dogmatism such freedom up to and including the present is only relative because many taboos are unconscious and pass themselves off as common sense or common decency whoever challenges them is by definition a heretic by definition a traitor or by definition an irresponsible nut rationalists who dominate in relatively open societies also have their own taboos as we shall see it was historian henry adams who first conceived the idea that there might be a mathematical expression describing the rate of change of human societies under the influence of newton's physics adam suggested and he was very tentative about this a fact to be remembered by those who ridicule his naivete that the utilization of energy might move forward as the inverse square of time just as newton's gravity functions as the inverse square of distance accepting the anthropology of his day adams assumed that humanity in its present form was about 90 000 plus years old he then reckoned that it took most of that time to arrive at galileo the scientific method beginnings of the industrial revolution and the great pleat and the great leap forward in energy utilization characteristic of the modern age or the open society since 300 is the inverse square of 90 000 adams assumed that the next great leap was inhab was happening while he was writing around 1900 300 years after galileo looking about him he decided this next jump to a higher energy was occurring in the researches of the curies who had just discovered radioactivity as many commentators have noted it is impossible to read atoms on the subject without feeling that he is very accurately forecasting the atomic age adams went further with the exhilaration of a great idea since 17 plus is the inverse square of 300 he predicted that the next great evolutionary stage would begin in 1917 plus and since the inverse square of 17 is 4 plus he predicted that the next step in around 19 uh that the next step would be around 1922 by then he said we should have infinite energy at our disposal it didn't quite work out that way nevertheless henry adams was on the right track his math was just oversimplified also on the right track was henry's brother brooks who is also looking for laws in history brooks observed a pattern which may or may not be entirely true but is as approximately true as the similar generalizations of vico hegel marx and twinbe every civilization brooks adams proposed goes through four stages one the monopolization of knowledge by priests eg the egyptian priests kept written language a secret among themselves as did the mayan priests two the monopolization of military power by conquerors who made themselves states or governments e.g a friend a french bastard tom payne's description of william the conqueror lands on the store a french bastard lands on the shore of england with the superior technology warriors on horse versus native warriors on foot and he becomes king his relatives and sycophants become lords of the land three the monopolization of the land by those landlords the extraction of tributes rent from those who live on the land four the monopolization of the issue of currency by national banks the extraction of tribute interest for each piece of currency put into circulation most civilizations seem to have gone through at least three of these stages not always consecutively some have passed through all four brooks adams also noted that centralized capital the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few interrelated families seems to have been moving steadily west throughout recorded history the first major accumulations are to be found in sumer the center of money power then shifted to egypt to greece to the italian peninsula to various parts of germany and then to london at the time brooks was writing around 1900 he saw the balance teetering between london and new york and he predicted the decline of the english empire would shift the balance to new york within the first half of the 20th century he seems to have been right brooks adams had no theory as to why this westward movement of wealth had been going on for 6 000 years he merely observed the pattern the shift is still continuing in the opinion of many for instance carl oglesby in the cowboy vs yankee war sees american politics since 1950 dominated by a struggle between old yankee wealth the new york boston axis which replaced london after 1900 and new cowboy wealth texas california oil and aerospace billionaires as of 1997 it looks like the cowboys are winning which is what you would expect if there were a real law between behind adam's east-west migration of capital one night in 1919 counts alfred korzynski awoke from a vivid dream tears of joy streaming down his face with a vivid sense that the passing of signals from generation to generation the third circuit time-binding function was what distinguished us from the other primates korzynski originally suggested that the time binding could be defined mathematically he dropped this idea later his math was as inadequate as henry adams but it is worth looking at for a moment to retrace the steps by which the actual law of acceleration was discovered what korzynski assumed at first was that if all the inventions discoveries etc of some hypothetical first generation of humans could be represented by p and the rates by which the second generation could surpass this r and mathematically the sum of total inventions discoveries etc at the end of the second generation would be p r p times r quite true algebraically then after third generation the stockpile would be p times r times r and after four generations p r r r generalized this becomes p times r to the power of t where c is the number of generations from whatever generation you have picked as your baseline uh there's a little blank in the copy of the pdf i have but it says the curve of if you put it on graph paper ascends more rapidly with each generation korzynski was looking straight at what alvin toffler later called future shock and was trying to write a mathematical formula for it many variables in

{"timestamp": 13827, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1638, "Output Length": 311, "prompt": "Here are some tips. Can you improve my linked in profile further?\n10. Write a Headline That Rocks\nYour headline is \u201cnot just your job title,\u201d Wasserman says. Instead, use that space to concisely communicate the core of who you are as a professional in a sentence or a few phrases. The more specific you can be about what sets you apart from the competition, the better. \u201cHighlight specific skills you want to be known for,\u201d Dunay says. And try to write something \u201cencompassing your professional career identity\u2014who you are and where you want to go,\u201d Wasserman says.\n\nFor example: NYS-licensed chemistry teacher specializing in hands-on learning with lesson plans that draw on 10 years working in a research lab\n\nRead More: How to Write Great LinkedIn Headlines (Plus, Examples)\n\n11. Include a Current Job Entry, Even When Unemployed\nWhen recruiters search on LinkedIn, one of the pieces of information the platform uses to return results is your current position\u2014and if you don\u2019t have one, you might not appear, Hallow says. So if you don\u2019t currently have a job, you should add the position or positions you\u2019re looking for (Social Media Coordinator/Assistant, for example), but add a line in the spot usually reserved for the company name that makes it clear you\u2019re not saying you\u2019re employed, like \u201cSeeking new opportunity\u201d or similar.\n\n12. Complete Your Intro\nDon\u2019t forget to fill out the smaller sections of your profile intro when applicable. They include:\n\nFormer name: Use this section (if you\u2019re comfortable with it!) to be searchable by names you no longer go by, such as a maiden name. You can also select who your past names are visible to.\nName pronunciation: LinkedIn first introduced this feature through its mobile app, Wasserman says. You might consider using it if you have a long, uncommon, or difficult-to-pronounce name.\nLocation: If LinkedIn gives you the option, Hallow recommends using a metropolitan area here over a suburb or smaller city so that you show up in more searches. If you\u2019re relocating, you can list your target city and expand in your summary.\nIndustry: You can only pick one, so if you don\u2019t have your search narrowed down to one specific industry, you can talk about additional ones in your summary, Hallow says.\nContact info: You should definitely add your email address here so that recruiters can reach you, but phone numbers and addresses are more common for those selling services on LinkedIn than for individual job seekers, Wasserman says. She does not recommend including a personal cell phone number. When it comes to adding additional social media platforms, you should only add them if they\u2019re professional and relevant to your job.\n13. Use Your Summary Wisely\nYour summary or \u201cAbout\u201d section is where you can really show your personality and share your story, Hallow says. And it doesn\u2019t need to be complicated.\n\nHere\u2019s how you might structure it:\n\nIntroduce yourself. Who are you as a professional and what do you do? What value do you bring to the organizations you work for?\nHighlight your key skills, experiences, and achievements in paragraph form or a bulleted list.\nTalk about who you are outside of work. This is optional, but you never know which of your interests might resonate with a recruiter, future employer, or professional connection.\nCall the reader to action by asking them to connect with you to discuss growth marketing, contact you about job or speaking opportunities, or do whatever you\u2019re currently looking to get from your LinkedIn profile.\nEven if you follow this structure, there are infinite ways to write your summary. \u201cThe \u2018About\u2019 section is very personal,\u201d Wasserman says. Use the first person, and don\u2019t be afraid to talk about what really matters to you in your career.\n\nRead More: 5 Templates That\u2019ll Make Writing the Perfect LinkedIn Summary a Total Breeze\n\n14. Show Off Your Expertise or Best Work in the Features Section\nJust below the \u201cAbout\u201d section is the \u201cFeatured\u201d sections, which allows you to showcase media, links, and LinkedIn articles and posts at the top of your profile. Sharing the work or mentions that are most relevant to your personal brand and LinkedIn goals is a great opportunity to show your skills in action, Wasserman says. If you have an online portfolio, the \u201cFeatured\u201d section is a great, highly visible spot to link to it.\n\n15. Tailor Your Experience\nWhile your resume should be tailored to each individual job you apply to, your LinkedIn profile should be tailored to the industry you work in or want to work in as well as the role you have or the type of role you\u2019re hoping to land, Hallow says. In your descriptions, emphasize the elements of your past experiences that are most relevant to the types of jobs you want. You can also include relevant volunteer work or school projects both in your experience section and the dedicated \u201cVolunteer experience\u201d and \u201cEducation\u201d sections lower down on your profile, Wasserman says.\n\n16. Use Strong Accomplishment-Driven Descriptions\nIn some ways, you can approach your LinkedIn profile as you would your resume: Rather than just listing your job duties under each entry in your experience section, you should be detailing your accomplishments. Each of your bullet points should describe not only what you did in your past jobs, but also how you did it, what the results were, and how it impacted your team or company. Whenever you can, include keywords to show what vital skills you used and when. And quantify your experiences and achievements. Numbers will help recruiters see the scope of your work and make your accomplishments feel more specific. What\u2019s more appealing? Someone who says they\u2019re proficient in Excel, or someone who says they\u2019ve built Excel spreadsheets that use pivot tables and filters to streamline a process and save their company 20+ hours a month?\n\nRead More: How to Turn Your Duties Into Accomplishments\n\n17. Add Links and Media to Your Work Experience\nYou can add links, images, videos, and files to the entries in your \u201cExperience\u201d section as well as your \u201cFeatured\u201d section. So use this to your advantage: Link to your company websites, projects you\u2019ve worked on, articles or reports you\u2019ve published, or anything else that can let recruiters see the work you\u2019re writing about with their own eyes.\n\n18. Make Sure Your Resume and LinkedIn Match\nYour resume and LinkedIn don\u2019t have to be identical. But your past positions, companies, degrees, and licenses and certifications should match up\u2014and so should the dates. Don\u2019t contradict yourself, Hallow says. You don\u2019t want hiring managers to think you\u2019re being dishonest.\n\n19. Add Licenses, Certifications, Projects, Volunteer Experiences, Accomplishments, or Languages\nUnderneath your work experience and education are additional spaces to show off your background and qualifications. Are you fluent in another language? Did you win a well-known award or write an article for a well-known publication in your industry? Are you licensed to practice in multiple states? Adding this information to your profile is a great way to showcase what makes you unique and helps you get in some additional keywords as well. But remember that if these skills and experiences are important to landing your next job, you should also try to work them into an earlier section.\n\n20. Add Your Skills\u2014Everywhere\nTout your skills throughout your profile\u2014not just in the \u201cSkills & endorsements\u201d section. As mentioned earlier, you should put them in context in your experience section, but make sure that your most relevant and marketable skills also appear in your summary and headline. And you should even try to get them into your recommendations (more on that below).\n\nIn the \u201cSkills & endorsements\u201d section itself, you can have up to 50 skills, but profile viewers can only see your top three, so choose the most important ones for these slots. You can also get other people in your network to vouch for your abilities."}]}

want more of the same and we all know people who have lots of misfortune Miss watching that we ourselves would not want to have and they are deeply happy they radiate happiness we are surprised why because they are grateful so it is not happiness that makes us grateful it's gratefulness that makes us happy if you think it's happiness that makes you grateful think again gratefulness that makes you happy [Music] I know that it's possible to do for every one of our lives every one of us in our lives to help somebody to liberate somebody to save somebody and I know when you move through life living your own truth and live through the Paradigm of service you too will be all right so I beseech you to go forth and serve serve first yourself honor your calling do what you're supposed to do

person that lives or or delivers your mail wherever you are Express gratitude for them and or Express gratitude in a journal A lot of people they like to Express gratitude by writing things down so it's verbally as great but also writing things down kinesthetically or something about putting pen to paper and to be able to see all those things some people what they'll do is they'll write and a little note card one thing they're grateful for that day and they'll put it into like a fishbowl and then at the end of like 365 days after a year they just go and read all those things and I even just get goosebumps thinking about that I call them truth bumps but it's just how do you come alive that way so my challenge for you today is you deserve to feel like you have more than you think you have like if you want to feel truly wealthy count all of the things you have in your life that money cannot buy [Music] gratitude is the best medicine [Music] it heals your mind body and spirit and ultimately attracts more things for you to be grateful for so I implore you to wake up each and every day and give thanks and show gratitude for what you have in your life and once you do that find yourself climbing over the hump and making each and every day of your life on Wednesday give thanks show gratitude [Music]\"\nReply in \u4e2d\u6587"}]}

The assignment will cover socket programming. You will use C or C++\nto implement it although C is recommended.\nBefore starting the implementation, please read Section 3.4 \u2013 Principles of Reliable Data Transfer from Kurose & Ross to cover the theory. For the practice, you can read Beej\u2019s Guide to Network\nProgramming (Using Internet Sockets). Finally, to understand the big picture regarding the reliable data transfer, you can check out the interactive material on the Kurose & Ross website and\nthis animation.\nYou can discuss the homework and ask your questions on the discussion forum thread on our\nODTUClass page. I am also available at yigit@ceng.metu.edu.tr.\n2 Setup\nPlease follow the instructions given in this section thoroughly to set up your homework environment.\nWe will use an Ubuntu Vagrant box as the host machine and create two network containers in\nit. By adjusting the parameters of the interfaces (at both ends) between the client and the server,\nwe will have a seamless and native unreliable channel without relying on any external programs.\nRun the following commands on an empty folder. If you follow along, you can code on your\nhost machine which is synced with the Vagrant box, so you can compile and run your client and\nserver on there.\n(host) vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64 # create a new ubuntu 22.04 box\n# Places a Vagrantfile on the empty directory\n# We will develop alongside it\n(host) mkdir code\nNow we have a directory with a Vagrantfile and the code directory inside. We can edit the\nVagrantfile to have the code directory synced inside the Vagrant box.\n1\n# -\\*- mode: ruby -\\*-\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\n# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The \"2\" in Vagrant.configure\n# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for\n# backwards compatibility). Please don\u2019t change it unless you know what\n# you\u2019re doing.\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\nconfig.vm.box = \"ubuntu/jammy64\"\n# config.vm.synced\\_folder line is commented out, you can edit it\nconfig.vm.synced\\_folder \"./code\", \"/home/vagrant/code\", type: \"rsync\"\n# the rest of the file is commented out and is not important\nend\nYou can use vagrant rsync to push your code inside the Vagrant box or vagrant rsync-auto\non another terminal (in the background) to automate the process.\nThe following sets up the containers.\n(host) vagrant up\n(host) vagrant ssh\n# Set $TERM and useful aliases to enter containers quickly\n(vagrant) echo -e \"export TERM=xterm-256color\" >> .bashrc\n(vagrant) echo -e \u2019alias server=\"sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0\"\u2019 >> .bashrc\n(vagrant) echo -e \u2019alias client=\"sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns1\"\u2019 >> .bashrc\n(vagrant) source ~/.bashrc # use the correct TERM and reload .bashrc\n(vagrant) sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\n(vagrant) sudo apt install gcc make\n(vagrant) sudo ip netns add netns0\n(vagrant) sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0\n(vagrant) sudo ip link set veth0 up\n(vagrant) sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0\n(vagrant) sudo ip netns add netns1\n(vagrant) sudo ip link add veth1 type veth peer name ceth1\n(vagrant) sudo ip link set veth1 up\n(vagrant) sudo ip link set ceth1 netns netns1\n(vagrant) sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0\n(server container) ip link set lo up\n(server container) ip link set ceth0 up\n(server container) ip addr add 172.24.0.10/16 dev ceth0 # from private IPv4 block\n(server container) exit\n(vagrant) sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns1\n(client container) ip link set lo up\n(client container) ip link set ceth1 up\n(client container) ip addr add 172.24.0.20/16 dev ceth1\n(client container) exit\n(vagrant) sudo ip link add br0 type bridge\n(vagrant) sudo ip link set br0 up\n2\n(vagrant) sudo ip link set veth0 master br0\n(vagrant) sudo ip link set veth1 master br0\nThe instructions were adapted from Container Networking is Simple!. If you are curious about\nthe process please refer to that tutorial, but understanding it is not necessary to complete this\nhomework.\nYou can also follow the steps on this screencast to see what should be happening at each step.\nAt the end of the screencast I demonstrate the nc binary as a makeshift server-client chat program.\nYour binaries will have a similar behavior.\nYou should run your client binary at the client container and the server binary at the server\ncontainer.\n2.1 Manipulating Traffic\nAll this setup for containers would be quite pointless sans this step. Here, we will write netem\n(Network Emulator) rules using tc to make the connection between the server and the client a lot\nworse. This section was prepared according to the lab manual from Jed Crandall\u2019s course. You\ncan refer to that document for a complete picture.\nThe following tc/netem rules are the worst case you will have to deal with. You should run\nthe rules twice inside each container, one for each interface.\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 50ms loss 25% 10% duplicate 25% reorder 25% 50%\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 50ms loss 25% 10% duplicate 25% reorder 25% 50%\nWhile developing, you might want to start with a good channel between the client and the\nserver, and degrade it as you complete the requirements. If you would like to follow that route,\nyou should first start with;\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 10ms\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 10ms\nAnd then change the tc rules gradually.\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface, note the change rather than add\ntc qdisc change dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 10ms loss 20%\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc change dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 10ms loss 20%\nThe following are useful as well;\n# see the current rules in effect\ntc qdisc show\n# deleting a rule using change is cumbersome\n# delete alltogether and start from scratch\n# mind the interface\ntc qdisc del dev ceth0 root"}]}

{"timestamp": 14035, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 591, "Output Length": 9, "prompt": "During the climactic final battle between the living forces, Cersei's forces, and the undead, unexpected and significant deaths occur on all sides, reshaping the course of the conflict and leaving a lasting impact on the survivors.\n\n1. On the living forces:\n* Grey Worm: As the leader of the Unsullied, Grey Worm is a formidable warrior and a crucial commander for Daenerys. However, in a tragic turn of events, he is struck down by one of the Night King's lieutenants while defending a crucial position. His death deeply affects Daenerys and Missandei, and serves as a rallying cry for the living forces to fight even harder.\n* Tormund Giantsbane: The fiery Wildling leader meets his end at the hands of a horde of wights while attempting to save a group of retreating soldiers. His death is a blow to the Free Folk and the living forces, but it strengthens Jon Snow's resolve to unite the people of Westeros against their common enemies.\n1. On Cersei's forces:\n* Euron Greyjoy: Euron Greyjoy, the ambitious and ruthless ruler of the Iron Islands, is killed during a naval battle against Daenerys' forces. His unexpected death weakens Cersei's naval power, leaving King's Landing more vulnerable to attack and forcing her to adapt her strategy.\n* Qyburn: As Cersei's most trusted advisor and the mastermind behind many of her schemes, Qyburn's death is a significant loss for her forces. He is killed by his own creation, the Mountain, when he attempts to intervene during a heated confrontation between the Mountain and Sandor Clegane, the Hound. Qyburn's death disrupts Cersei's plans and leaves her without a vital source of counsel and support.\n1. On the undead:\n* Viserion: The Night King's reanimated dragon, Viserion, is unexpectedly killed during a fierce battle in the skies above King's Landing. Drogon, under Daenerys' command, manages to deliver a fatal blow to the undead dragon, plunging it into the sea. Viserion's death weakens the Night King's aerial advantage and further galvanizes the living forces.\n* A White Walker Lieutenant: In a surprising turn of events, Jaime Lannister sacrifices himself to kill a powerful White Walker lieutenant, saving Brienne of Tarth from certain death. Jaime's actions cause the wights under the lieutenant's control to collapse, providing a brief reprieve for the living forces. His selfless act helps to change the tide of the battle and marks his redemption in the eyes of many.\n\nThese unexpected and key deaths have a profound impact on the conflict, shaping the strategies and morale of each side. The sacrifices of these characters serve as a testament to the high stakes of the battle and the determination of all involved to secure a better future for Westeros."}]}

{"timestamp": 14067, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 355, "Output Length": 6, "prompt": "In databases, a key is a field or set of fields that uniquely identify a record in a table. There are several types of keys that can be used in a database:\n\n1. Primary key: A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It is used to enforce the integrity of the data and ensure that each record can be uniquely identified. A table can have only one primary key.\n2. Foreign key: A foreign key is a field or set of fields that is used to establish a link between two tables. It is used to enforce referential integrity and ensure that data is consistent across multiple tables.\n3. Candidate key: A candidate key is a set of one or more fields that can be used as a primary key for a table. A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one primary key.\n4. Composite key: A composite key is a combination of two or more fields that are used together as a primary key for a table.\n5. Surrogate key: A surrogate key is a unique identifier that is assigned to a record, typically by the database management system, rather than using an existing field. It is used as a primary key and has no semantic meaning.\n6. Natural key: A natural key is a unique identifier that is based on the inherent properties of the data, such as a social security number or a product code. It is used as a primary key and has semantic meaning.\n\nEach type of key has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which key to use depends on the specific requirements of the application. Primary keys and foreign keys are essential for enforcing the integrity of the data, while candidate keys, composite keys, and surrogate keys are used to improve the performance and flexibility of the database."}]}

{"timestamp": 14137, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 444, "Output Length": 9, "prompt": "To define claims in your ASP.NET MVC Core application, you can use the `Claim` class provided by the `System.Security.Claims` namespace. A claim is a piece of information about a user, such as their name, email address, or group membership.\n\nYou can add claims to a user's identity by creating a new `ClaimsIdentity` object and adding the claims to the `Claims` property. Here's an example:\n```csharp\nvar claims = new List<Claim>\n{\n    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, \"John Doe\"),\n    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Email, \"john.doe@example.com\"),\n    new Claim(\"groups\", \"Page1_Readers\"),\n    new Claim(\"groups\", \"Page2_Readers\"),\n};\nvar identity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, \"MyAuthenticationScheme\");\nvar principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(identity);\n```\nIn this example, the `claims` list contains several claims, including the user's name, email address, and group membership. The `groups` claim is a custom claim that specifies which groups the user is a member of. You can add multiple values to a claim by creating multiple instances of the claim with the same type and adding them to the list.\n\nOnce you have created a `ClaimsIdentity` object with the user's claims, you can create a `ClaimsPrincipal` object and assign the identity to the `ClaimsPrincipal` constructor.\n\nTo assign access to claims, you can use an external authorization system, such as Azure AD or an IGA system. The authorization system can define which claims are required to access specific resources and under what conditions.\n\nFor example, in Azure AD, you can assign app roles to users or groups, and define permissions for each app role.

Here are some general steps you can follow:\n\n1. Define the requirements: Determine what functionality you want to provide to users, such as the ability to place bets, view upcoming matches, or check the status of their bets.\n2. Choose a UI framework: There are many UI frameworks available for building decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum, including React, Vue, and Angular. Choose the one that you are most comfortable with and that best meets the needs of your project.\n3. Install the necessary packages: Depending on the framework you choose, you may need to install additional packages to enable web3 functionality, connect to the Ethereum network, and interact with your smart contract. Some popular packages include web3.js, ethers.js, and Truffle.\n4. Connect to your smart contract: Use the web3 provider to connect to the Ethereum network and instantiate an instance of your smart contract in your UI code. This will allow you to interact with your contract from your UI.\n5. Implement the user interface: Use the framework you chose to create the various views and components needed for your dApp. For example, you may want to create a view that displays upcoming matches, another view for placing bets, and a third view for checking the status of bets.\n6. Write the necessary JavaScript functions: Write the JavaScript functions that interact with your smart contract to perform the desired functionality. For example, you may need functions for placing bets, retrieving match data from the oracle, and checking the status of bets.\n7. Test the UI: Test the UI to ensure that it functions as intended and that users can interact with your smart contract successfully.\n8. Deploy the UI: Once you have tested your UI, deploy it to a web server or decentralized storage platform like IPFS so that users can access it.\n\nThese are just general steps, and the specific implementation will depend on the UI framework and tools you choose. You can find many resources online that provide tutorials and code samples for building dApp UIs with various frameworks."}]}

It's our 'paint by numbers' approach to change management that combines decades of experience into a simple and practical guide.\n\nIn this introduction, we'll cover the basics of change, why change management is important, and what to expect from our ABCDE method. By the end of it, we're sure you'll have everything you need to tackle change like a pro!\n\nWe'll share our hard-won lessons so you can avoid common pitfalls and focus your efforts in the right places. You'll learn how to make sure you're clear on the reasons for change and how to get everyone and everything ready. So, buckle up and let's dive in!\n\nFirst things first, what exactly is change? Well, change is simply when something becomes different. And change management is all about managing that process. But as experienced change management practitioners, we know that common sense isn't always so common. That's why we use structured common sense to make change happen.\n\nChange can come in all shapes and sizes, from introducing new technology to improving processes, making personnel changes, or even moving offices. And in most cases, change involves a combination of systems, processes, and people.\n\nOne important thing to remember is that not everyone will welcome change with open arms. So, it's crucial to recognize this and tailor your approach to best suit the situation.\n\nHave you heard of the change curve? It's a helpful way of understanding how people react to change. Basically, it shows that as time passes, people move from shock and denial to anger, bargaining, and depression before finally reaching acceptance and engagement. The quicker you can get people through the initial stages, the smoother the change process will"}]}

In the book's first chapter, Turner lays out his argument that Indigenous philosophy is not simply a matter of applying Western philosophical concepts to Indigenous contexts, but involves a fundamentally different way of thinking about the world.\n\nTurner begins by challenging the idea that philosophy is a universal discipline, arguing that it has historically been dominated by Western perspectives and ways of thinking. He suggests that Indigenous philosophy, by contrast, is grounded in the particular experiences and perspectives of Indigenous peoples, and is thus inherently situated and contextual.\n\nTurner goes on to explore some of the key themes and concepts in Indigenous philosophy, including the importance of relationship and connection, the concept of \"all my relations,\" and the significance of land and place. He argues that these concepts are not simply metaphors or symbols, but represent fundamental ways of understanding and relating to the world.\n\nAt the heart of Turner's argument is the idea that Indigenous philosophy is a critical philosophy, one that is deeply engaged with issues of power, oppression, and resistance. He suggests that Indigenous philosophy is not simply a matter of celebrating Indigenous culture and heritage, but involves a critical examination of the structures of power that have historically marginalized and oppressed Indigenous peoples.\n\nTurner's work is an important contribution to the ongoing project of decolonizing philosophy, and challenges us to think beyond the limits of Western philosophy and to engage with the distinctively Indigenous perspectives and ways of knowing.

The client (e.g. a mobile app or a web application) sends a request to the APIM gateway.\n2. The APIM gateway checks if the request has a valid OAuth2 token. If the token is invalid or missing, the APIM gateway redirects the request to the Auth service.\n3. The Auth service is responsible for authenticating the user and issuing a new OAuth2 token if the user's credentials are correct.\n4. Once the user is authenticated, the APIM gateway adds the OAuth2 token to the request and forwards it to the appropriate service endpoint.\n\nYou can configure Azure API Management to use Azure Active Directory (AAD) as an identity provider, which allows you to secure your APIs using OAuth2. This can be done using Azure portal, Azure CLI or ARM templates.\n\nIn the Azure portal, you can create an instance of Azure API Management and configure it to use Azure Active Directory for authentication. You can then create an API in Azure API Management and configure it to require an OAuth2 token for all requests.\n\nYou can also use Azure CLI or ARM templates to automate the creation of Azure API Management and the configuration of OAuth2.\n\nYou can also use Azure Active Directory B2C as an alternative of Azure Active Directory, it is a fully managed identity platform for your consumer-facing web and mobile apps that can be easily integrated with your APIs.\n\nIt's also worth noting that with this approach, the authentication is centralized, so you don't have to worry about handling user authentication on each individual service. Once a user is authenticated, the APIM gateway can handle the routing of the requests to the correct service endpoint."}]}

BlackRock has a large and loyal customer base, and it may be difficult for you to attract and retain customers when you are first starting out. Another natural barrier to entry is the high level of expertise and resources that are required to be successful in the investment management industry.\n\nOne legal barrier to entry that you will face is the regulatory environment. Investment management companies are highly regulated, and it can be difficult to comply with all of the laws and regulations that apply to the industry. There may be a significant investment of time and resources required in order to obtain the necessary licenses and permits to operate an investment management company.\n\nb) Economies of scale refer to the idea that larger firms can produce goods and services at a lower cost than smaller firms because they are able to take advantage of lower costs per unit as they increase production. For example, a large firm like BlackRock may be able to negotiate lower fees with investment managers and custodians, which allows them to offer customers lower fees than smaller firms. They also have a large customer base that generates revenue for the company.\nIn addition, the company can also invest in technology and research to drive growth.\n\nSince you only have $100,000 in assets, it would be difficult for you to compete with BlackRock in terms of economies of scale. Your company would not have the same resources to invest in technology, marketing, or research as BlackRock does which would make it difficult for you to attract and retain customers, or to offer them competitive fees. Additionally, your customer base is much smaller and generates less revenue, making it harder for you to invest in the business and build economies of scale.\n\nc) The concept of diminishing marginal returns is the economic concept that states that as the quantity of a variable input is increased while holding all other inputs constant, a point will eventually be reached at which the additional output from an extra unit of input starts to decrease.\nIn the context of your investment firm, as you start to add more workers to your team, you will eventually reach a point where the additional output generated by an extra worker starts to decrease. This may happen due to a number of reasons such as; lack of coordination among workers, the increased difficulty of managing a larger team, the increased costs associated with managing a larger team, or the difficulty of maintaining a high level of quality control when there are more workers involved.\n\nWhen marginal returns starts to decrease, the cost of adding additional workers exceeds the benefit of the extra output they generate, making it less profitable for the company. That's when productivity starts to decline."}]}

The method accepts the input latitude, longitude, and radius, and an optional parameter for the area identifier, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the location is within the specified radius of the default or specified area. The `CalculateDistance` method is a helper method that is used to determine the distance between the input location and the center of the default or specified area.\n\nYou may also want to consider implementing caching and a spatial index as discussed in the previous response to improve the performance of this endpoint. Additionally, you can use a unit testing framework such as NUnit or xUnit to create test cases that exercise the different scenarios and input variations that your endpoint is expected to handle."}]}

It then defines an `async` function `example` that makes two asynchronous POST requests using the `makeRequest` function and the `await` keyword, and waits for both requests to complete using `Promise.all`.\n\nWhen the `example` function is called at the end of the program, it executes asynchronously and logs the results of both requests to the console.\n\nNow, here's an equivalent example in Java using multi-threading:\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.OutputStream;\nimport java.net.HttpURLConnection;\nimport java.net.URL;\n\npublic class MultiThreadExample {\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n    System.out.println(\"Starting...\");\n    Thread t1 = new Thread(new RequestSender(\"https://example.com/api1\", \"{\\\"message\\\": \\\"Request 1\\\"}\"));\n    Thread t2 = new Thread(new RequestSender(\"https://example.com/api2\", \"{\\\"message\\\": \\\"Request 2\\\"}\"));\n    t1.start();\n    t2.start();\n    t1.join();\n    t2.join();\n    System.out.println(\"All requests have completed!\");\n  }\n\n  private static class RequestSender implements Runnable {\n    private String url;\n    private String data;\n\n    public RequestSender(String url, String data) {\n      this.url = url;\n      this.data = data;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n      try {\n        URL url = new URL(this.url);\n        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n        conn.setRequestMethod(\"POST\");\n        conn.setRequestProperty(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n        conn.setDoOutput(true);\n        OutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();\n        os.write(this.data.getBytes());\n        os.flush();\n        os.close();\n        conn.getResponseCode();\n        System.out.println(this.url + \" has completed!\");\n      } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThis program uses the `HttpURLConnection` class to create two threads, `t1` and `t2`, each of which is responsible for sending a POST request to a specified URL with a specified data. The `RequestSender` class implements the `Runnable` interface and contains the logic to send a POST request.\n\nWhen the `main` method is executed, it starts both threads using the `start()` method.

{"timestamp": 14625, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 622, "Output Length": 11, "prompt": "Retrofitting buildings to make them more resistant to earthquakes involves reinforcing and upgrading the existing structure to enhance its ability to withstand seismic forces. The specific retrofitting measures required will depend on the building's age, materials, design, and location. Here are some common seismic retrofitting techniques to improve a building's earthquake resistance:\n\n1. Foundation anchorage: Strengthen the connection between the building's structure and its foundation to prevent the building from sliding off its foundation during an earthquake. This can involve bolting the sill plates to the foundation, installing anchor bolts, or adding steel plates or straps to reinforce the connection.\n2. Cripple wall reinforcement: Many buildings, particularly older ones, have short wood-framed walls (called cripple walls) between the foundation and the first floor. These walls can collapse during an earthquake, causing significant damage. To reinforce cripple walls, install plywood sheathing or diagonal bracing to create a stiffer, stronger wall system.\n3. Shear wall installation: Add shear walls, which are vertical walls made of reinforced concrete, masonry, or wood, to help resist lateral forces during an earthquake. Shear walls can be added to the interior or exterior of a building and should be strategically placed to improve the overall stiffness and stability of the structure.\n4. Moment-resisting frames: Install steel or reinforced concrete moment-resisting frames, which are designed to resist both vertical and lateral forces during an earthquake. These frames can provide additional support and help prevent the building's collapse.\n5. Roof-to-wall connections: Strengthen the connections between the roof and walls by adding metal straps, clips, or additional framing members. This can help prevent the roof from separating from the walls during an earthquake.\n6. Diaphragm strengthening: Reinforce the floors and roofs (known as diaphragms) by adding bracing, stiffeners, or additional framing to improve their rigidity and ability to transfer lateral forces to the vertical structural elements.\n7. Soft-story retrofitting: Buildings with soft stories (floors with large openings and few interior walls) are particularly vulnerable to collapse during earthquakes. Retrofitting these structures can involve adding new shear walls, steel frames, or other bracing systems to improve their lateral stability.\n8. Nonstructural retrofits: Secure nonstructural elements, such as partitions, ceilings, lighting systems, and cladding, to prevent them from falling or causing damage during an earthquake. Additionally, secure heavy objects and appliances, like bookshelves or water heaters, to minimize the risk of injury or damage.\n9. Base isolation: In some cases, it may be possible to install base isolation systems, which involve placing a building on flexible bearings or pads that allow it to move independently from the ground motion during an earthquake. This technique can significantly reduce the forces experienced by the structure.\n\nIt is crucial to consult with professionals, such as structural engineers or architects with expertise in seismic design and retrofitting, to determine the most effective retrofitting measures for your building. These experts can assess the building's unique characteristics and vulnerabilities and recommend the appropriate solutions to enhance its earthquake resistance."}]}

{"timestamp": 14752, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 478, "Output Length": 17, "prompt": "Yes, there have been studies that have used NHANES data for econometric demand estimation. Econometric demand estimation is a method used in economics to estimate how changes in the price of a product or service affect the quantity demanded of that product or service, taking into account other factors that may also influence demand.\n\nHere are a few examples of studies that have used NHANES data for econometric demand estimation:\n\n1. \"The effects of food prices and taxes on dietary quality and health: A systematic review and meta-analysis\" by Afshin A, Penalvo J, Del Gobbo L, Silva J, Michaelson M, O'Flaherty M, et al. (PLoS One, 2017). This study used NHANES data to estimate the price elasticity of demand for various food and beverage categories among U.S. adults. The study found that the price elasticity of demand varied by food and beverage category, with some categories (like sugar-sweetened beverages) showing a higher price sensitivity than others.\n2. \"The effect of food price changes on consumer purchases: A randomized experiment\" by Epstein LH, Handley EA, Dearing KK, Temple JL. (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2012). This study used NHANES data to estimate the price elasticity of demand for sugar-sweetened beverages among U.S. adults, and then used this information to design a randomized experiment to test the effect of price changes on beverage purchases. The study found that increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages led to a decrease in purchases, and that this effect was more pronounced among low-income individuals.\n3. \"Demand for sugar-sweetened beverages and fast food in the United States\" by Powell LM, Chaloupka FJ. (Economic Research Report, 2009). This study used NHANES data to estimate the price elasticity of demand for sugar-sweetened beverages and fast food among U.S. adults and children. The study found that both adults and children were responsive to changes in prices, with higher price elasticities of demand for low-income individuals and children.\n\nThese studies illustrate how NHANES data can be used to estimate demand elasticities for food and beverage products, which can be useful for understanding how changes in prices or other factors may affect consumption patterns and health outcomes."}]}

Their hearts raced, but they found solace in the silence that enveloped them like a cloak, a barrier against the world outside.\n\nIn their separate stations, they moved with a grace they had never known they possessed, their bodies telling stories that transcended words. They became trapped birds yearning for freedom, lost souls navigating the endless labyrinth of life, and lonely travelers on a journey to find meaning in a vast and empty universe.\n\nTheir audience, a sea of faces both enraptured and judgmental, seemed to fade into the background as the two friends found themselves lost in the world of their creation. Each movement, each gesture, carried with it a weight and significance that transcended time and space.\n\nBut the performance was not without its challenges. The mime makeup they applied tingled on their skin, a strange and unnerving sensation that seemed to heighten their awareness of every touch and sensation. And their exhaustion grew with each passing moment, their bodies aching from the strain of maintaining their silent artistry.\n\nAs the hours ticked by, Sarah and Emily fought to maintain their focus, their minds beginning to fray at the edges. The line between reality and illusion grew ever thinner, and they could feel the darkness that lurked within the world of mime work, whispering its secrets and threatening to consume them whole.\n\nFinally, the performances came to an end, and the friends were led to an after-show lounge, where they could decompress and recover from the intensity of their experience. As they shared stories of their individual encounters with the audience, they found themselves overcome by an inexplicable desire to perform for each other, as if the act of miming had become an essential part of who they were.\n\nIn that moment, as they moved in silent harmony, Sarah and Emily realized that their foray into the world of mime work had changed them forever. They had glimpsed the shadows that dwelled within the art of silence, and in doing so, had unlocked a part of themselves they never knew existed.

The `pua_admin_menu()` function should use the `add_menu_page()` function to add a top-level menu item for your plugin.\n\nHere is an example of how you can add the `pua_admin_menu()` function to your plugin:\n```\nfunction pua_admin_menu() {\n    add_menu_page(\n        'Page Update Alerts', // page title\n        'Page Update Alerts', // menu title\n        'manage_options', // capability\n        'pua-settings', // menu slug\n        'pua_settings_page' // function to display the settings page\n    );\n}\nadd_action( 'admin_menu', 'pua_admin_menu' );\n```\nThe `add_menu_page()` function takes the following arguments:\n\n1. `page title` - The title of the page that will be displayed when the user clicks on the menu item.\n2. `menu title` - The text that will be used for the menu item.\n3. `capability` - The user role that has permission to access the menu item. In this example, only users with the \"manage\\_options\" capability will be able to see the menu item.\n4. `menu slug` - The unique identifier for the menu item.\n5. `function to display the settings page` - The name of the function that will be called to display the settings page for your plugin.\n\nIn the code above, the `pua_settings_page()` function does not yet exist. You will need to create this function and add it to your plugin. The function should output the HTML for the settings page of your plugin.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement the `pua_settings_page()` function:\n```\nfunction pua_settings_page() {\n    ?>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n        <h1>Page Update Alerts Settings</h1>\n        <form method=\"post\" action=\"options.php\">\n            <?php\n            settings_fields( 'pua_settings' );\n            do_settings_sections( 'pua-settings' );\n            submit_button();\n            ?>\n        </form>\n    </div>\n    <?php\n}\n```\nThe `pua_settings_page()` function uses the `settings_fields()` and `do_settings_sections()` functions to output the settings fields for your plugin. The `submit_button()` function is used to display a \"Save Changes\" button at the bottom of the page.\n\nYou will also need to add some code to register the settings fields for your plugin. You can do this by adding the following code to the `pua_admin_menu()` function:\n```\nfunction pua_admin_menu() {\n    // code to add menu page\n\n    // register settings\n    register_setting( 'pua_settings', 'pua_email' );\n    add_settings_section( 'pua_section_email', 'Email Settings', 'pua_section_email_cb', 'pua-settings' );\n    add_settings_field( 'pua_field_email', 'Email Address', 'pua\n```"}]}
{"timestamp": 15021, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 425, "Output Length": 14, "prompt": "Sure, here's a deeper dive into the menstrual cycle:\n\n1. Phases: The menstrual cycle is a series of changes that occur in the female reproductive system each month in preparation for pregnancy. It is divided into three main phases: the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase.\n2. Follicular Phase: The follicular phase begins on the first day of menstruation and lasts about 14 days on average. During this phase, the pituitary gland in the brain releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates several follicles in the ovaries to mature. As the follicles mature, they release estrogen, which causes the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for a potential pregnancy.\n3. Ovulation: Ovulation occurs around day 14 of the menstrual cycle, when a mature follicle releases an egg (ovum) from the ovary. The egg travels through the fallopian tube towards the uterus, where it may be fertilized by sperm.\n4. Luteal Phase: The luteal phase begins after ovulation and lasts about 14 days on average. During this phase, the ruptured follicle that released the egg forms a structure called the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone to support the thickened uterine lining. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum breaks down and hormone levels drop, leading to the shedding of the uterine lining and the start of a new menstrual cycle.\n5. Hormones: The menstrual cycle is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones, including FSH, estrogen, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).\n\nUnderstanding the menstrual cycle is important in understanding female reproductive health and infertility. Problems with the menstrual cycle, such as irregular periods or hormonal imbalances, can interfere with fertility and overall health. Understanding the phases of the menstrual cycle and the hormonal changes that occur can help in identifying potential issues and guiding appropriate treatment options."}]}
{"timestamp": 15023, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 473, "Output Length": 147, "prompt": "Rewrite the following passage and reduce it by half \n\nAccording to dictionaries, altruism is a selfless concern for the good of others and a willingness to sacrifice one\u2019s personal interests for them. In today\u2019s society, altruism is considered the highest virtue and is actively promoted through religion, culture, and education. Instead, people who, for selfish reasons, are not willing to give up their own interests are called immoral and evil.\nIn her philosophy, Ayn Rand debunks these common dogmas by showing that altruism, not selfishness, is evil.\nNature does not provide man with automatic survival. This means that in order to live, a person must worry about their own interests. If a doctrine (altruism) says that worrying about one\u2019s interests is evil, then it turns out that the very desire to live is evil. According to Ayn \u200b\u200bRand, no teaching can be eviler.\n\nThe basic principle of altruism is that you must live for others and serve the happiness of others. Ayn Rand asks a simple question that shows the falsity of this principle \u2013 \u201cwhy?\u201d. Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others and not your own? Why is it moral to worry about other people\u2019s interests and not your own? Why is it moral when others feel pleasure thanks to your help, but immoral when you feel pleasure?\nFor hundreds of years, people who promoted altruism have not found a rational answer to these questions. The only thing that allows them to justify the requirement to be altruistic is mysticism: supernatural, unearthly, irrational. Altruism is supported only by the belief that it is right. Rationality is incompatible with altruism.\n\n \nBeing altruistic means sacrificing yourself. And the victim cannot be happy. Altruists, giving in to their own values and needs, expect others to do the same. And when that doesn\u2019t happen, they get angry: \u201cWhy do I do everything for them, and they do nothing for me?\u201d Thus, altruism causes constant injustice, double standards, unresolved conflicts, and contradictions.\n\nRational selfishness is man\u2019s only path to happiness. It is important to understand that it is not about neglecting other people, but about making your life and your happiness a priority. Helping others should be an act of generosity, not a moral obligation."}]}

Codey is a student who has consistently displayed problematic behavior in the classroom and during activities. He has been observed cussing, talking out, and disrupting peers, as well as refusing to do work and arguing with staff. Codey has also been physically aggressive, kicking walls and doors and hitting walls. He has made inappropriate comments and jokes, and has exposed himself in the classroom. Additionally, he has refused to work and has been noncompliant when asked to follow directions. This student requires consistent supervision and intervention to address his behavior and support his academic progress. \n\nIt is clear that the individual in question has a difficult time with impulse control, respect for authority and their peers, and completing tasks as assigned. In order to change this behavior, it is important to address each of these issues separately and work on strategies to improve them. \n\nFirst, it may be helpful to work on impulse control through techniques such as mindfulness or deep breathing to help the individual learn how to regulate their emotions and reactions. It may also be helpful to set clear boundaries and consequences for inappropriate behavior, and consistently follow through with those consequences to teach the individual that their actions have consequences. \n\nAdditionally, working on respect for authority and peers is crucial in changing this behavior. This can be done through role-playing scenarios, discussing the importance of respect, and consistently reinforcing respectful behavior. It may also be helpful to work on communication skills, as many of the instances of disrespectful behavior stem from misunderstandings or a lack of effective communication. \n\nFinally, it is important to address the issue of completing tasks as assigned. This can be done through setting clear expectations and providing support and guidance as needed. It may also be helpful to break tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps and to provide incentives or rewards for completing tasks. \n\nOverall, it is important to be consistent and patient in addressing these behavior issues, as it may take time for the individual to see improvement.

The response should be concise and easy to understand.\n\nMy first task is Montage Essay, \u201cI Love/I Know\u201d Type\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of my life as an anti-vegetable carboholic. For years, processed snack foods ruled the kitchen kingdom of my household and animal products outnumbered plant-based offerings. \n\nMy transformation began with my mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis. My mom went on a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I fully embraced this new eating philosophy to show my support. Eager to figure out the whole \u201cvegan\u201d thing, the two of us started binge-watching health documentaries such as \u201cWhat the Health\u201d and \u201cForks Over Knives\u201d. We read all the books by the featured doctors like \u201cThe China Study\u201d and \u201cHow Not To Die\u201d. I became entranced by the world of nutritional science and how certain foods could help prevent cancer or boost metabolism. \n\nEach new food I discovered gave me an education on the role diet plays on health. I learned that, by eating sweet potatoes and brown rice, you could cure acne and heart disease. I discovered eating leafy greens with citrus fruits could boost iron absorption rates. I loved pairing my foods to create the perfect macronutrient balance. Did you know beans and rice make a complete protein? \n\nFood has also turned me into a sustainability nut. Living plant-based also saves the planet from the impact of animal agriculture. For the same amount of land space, a farmer can produce 200 kilograms of soybeans versus 16 kilograms of beef. I do my part to have as small of an ecological footprint as I can. I stopped using plastic snack bags and instead turned to reusable beeswax wraps. My favorite reusable appliance is my foldable straw. If I am going to nourish my body, shouldn\u2019t I also want to nourish the earth? \n\nMy journey toward healthy living led me to becoming co-leader of the Northern Nevada PlantPure Pod, \u201cBiggest Little Plant Pod\u201d, a group dedicated to spreading the message about the whole food plant-based lifestyle. We are currently working on a restaurant campaign to encourage local eateries to create a plant-based, oil-free menu option and become PlantPure certified. After discovering how many restaurants use oil in their cooking, I decided I needed to open a plant-based oil free cafe to make up for this gap. My dream is to open up my very own affordable oatmeal cafe based on my Instagram page, morning\\_mOATivations. And I know that oatmeal isn\u2019t the sexiest superfood out there, so here\u2019s my sales pitch: I\u2019m going to make oatmeal the Beyonce of the breakfast world- sweet, sassy, and power packed. This allows me to educate people about nutritional science through the stomach. \n\nFinally, I am a strong proponent of hands-on experience for learning what good food looks and tastes like, so cooking is one of my favorite ways to teach the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Using my taste buds as my textbook to learn which flavors work together and which ones don\u2019t helps me educate, as I\u2019ve found that information tends to stick in a person\u2019s mind once they\u2019ve experienced healthy, delicious foods with their own senses. Our society has taught us that delicious food has to make us feel guilty, when that is simply not the case. The best feeling in the world is falling in love with a dish and then learning all the health benefits that it provides the body.\n\nWhile my classmates complain about being tired, I have more energy because my body is finally getting the right macros, vitamins, and minerals it needs. This has allowed me to push myself harder physically, excelling in running and earning my high school Cross Country team\u2019s Most Improved award. I\u2019m still a picky eater. But the foods I am particular about have changed. Rather than a carboholic, I choose to call myself a vegeholic.. The target language is English.\n \n \n \n \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30"}]}

This can lead to large scale production facilities in developed countries that utilize advanced technologies to automate production.\n\nDeveloping Markets:\n\n* Focus on scaling up production and distribution to reach larger customer bases\n* Reliance on low-cost labor to achieve economies of scale\n* Tendency towards informal markets and decentralized supply chains\n* Emphasis on adapting products to local markets\n\nSupporting point: For example, in the agriculture industry, small farmers in developing countries often rely on informal markets and decentralized supply chains to distribute their products. By working together in cooperatives or using technology to connect with buyers, they can achieve economies of scale and reach larger markets.\n\nCausality of these trends:\nDeveloped markets have access to advanced technologies and more developed infrastructure, which allows them to achieve economies of scale through automation and standardization. Developing markets, on the other hand, may lack the resources to invest in advanced technologies, but have access to low-cost labor and a large untapped customer base, making it necessary to scale production and distribution in order to compete.\n\nVolatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity expressed in scenarios or examples:\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, leading to shortages of raw materials and labor. This has made it difficult for businesses in both developed and developing markets to achieve economies of scale, as they may face increased costs or reduced demand.\n\nPredictions:\nIn developed markets, the trend towards automation and advanced technologies is likely to continue, as businesses seek to improve efficiency and reduce costs. In developing markets, there may be a shift towards more formalized supply chains and greater investment in technology as these markets become more integrated into the global economy.\n\nImplications:\nBusinesses that can effectively navigate the differences in approach between developed and developing markets will be better positioned to achieve economies of scale and compete in global markets. However, it will be important to remain agile and adaptable in the face of volatility and uncertainty, as events such as pandemics or geopolitical tensions can disrupt supply chains and markets."}]}

For\nmixture model analyses, we removed outlying model fits using the\nsame criteria as for Experiments 1a and 1b, resulting in the\ncomplete removal of one participant, and the removal of a single\ncondition for nine other participants. The mixture model analyses\nalso identified a minimal contribution of nontarget errors (\u00051% of\ntrials), and we did not examine the relationship between this\nparameter and probability. Some variance was attributed to nontarget errors in the variable precision model; thus, we did examine\nthis relationship through the NTslope parameter. Similar to the\nresults of Experiments 1a and 1b, all measures of working memory\nperformance varied statistically significantly with probability, with\nthe power-law function providing a good description of the relationship where appropriate (all R2 values .7): SDresponse,\nt(24) \u000713.12, p \u0005 .001, R2 .708; mixture model guess rate,\nt(23) \u00075.38, p \u0005 .001, R2 .807; mixture model standard\ndeviation, t(23) \u00073.56, p .002, R2 .915; variable precision\n\u0004, t(24) \u000710.08, p \u0005 .001; and variable precision NTslope,\nt(24) 5.38, p \u0005 .001.\nThese results extend the conclusions of Experiments 1a and 1b\nin three ways. First, we replicate the patterns observed in Experiments 1a and 1b that numerous measures of VWM performance\nvary with probability, supporting the conclusion that feature-based\nattention regulates more than just the likelihood of each item being\nsuccessfully maintained in VWM. Second, changes in performance do not appear to be limited to just high-probability items\nbut extend across the range of measured probabilities (8.25\u2013\n100%). Third, changes in performance appear to vary with probability as a function of a power law, and this fit appears to be\nparticularly strong for measures of precision (both in the mixture\nmodel and variable precision model analyses). Although a formal\ncomparison of competing models is necessary to assess if a powerlaw function provides the best fit of these data, these results are\nnevertheless consistent with the flexible division of a continuous\nVWM resource that is distributed across all memory items based\non the probability that each will be probed. These clear effects onprecision provide a strong demonstration that, beyond filtering,\nfeature-based attention regulates how precisely an item is represented in memory.2 / 2"}]}

She had no illusions about the kind of people she was dealing with, and she knew that the only way out was through sheer determination and brutality.\n\nFinally, after months of preparation, the day arrived.

{"timestamp": 15470, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1017, "Output Length": 87, "prompt": "proofread this email and give me your thoughts first without changing anything in your response: \nHello Alex, I hope you\u2019re having a good morning and that this email finds you well.\n\nI wanted to reach out to you with an update regarding the property.\n\nFirstly, I would like to express my gratitude towards the landlord for repairing the dishwasher in such a timely manner. Venkatesh came to take a look at the dishwasher on Monday morning and successfully repaired the issue. I had meant to send a thank you email sooner but have been very unwell this week.\n\nHowever, I do have some other concerns that I would like to bring to your attention. Recently, I found a rusty metal spike sticking out of the ground where the back gate is to be replaced. Venkatesh had informed me that there was construction debris back there but never mentioned that there could be hazards coming out of the ground. I only found this hard spike after hearing an awful shriek from my dog who I can only assume stepped on it. Seeing there are no other hazards back there and she was passing by that gate site. I had only ever seen the metal posts used for construction laid flat on the ground near the gate site and thought the construction mess was limited to those as I had not been warned about dangerous protrusions from the gravel or ground, the spike had been present most likely since the removal of the gate, without being noticed.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to mention that this happened while my dog was in the backyard while Venkatesh was seeing to the dishwasher. She is usually not outside unattended, but I had no reason to believe that there was a dangerous hazard in the area.\n\nFurthermore, to provide context for this situation, I would like to make rent select aware that the neighborhood has seemingly started to degrade in terms of safety. In my entire tenancy in this property up until recently, I had always felt very safe. However, in recent months a few of our neighbors have been affected by the recent uptick in crime and aggressive individuals in the area. The park which sits in the middle of the neighborhood has also started to show signs of unruly individuals. I recently had my safety threatened there by an individual I can only presume was on drugs. This being the case, I was quite distressed to wake up this morning and find our side gate wide open to the street. It had been secured with the latch and bolted, but due to the Gardeners coming through, my personal master lock had not been resecured on the latch. Due to the bottom bolt (the one going into the ground) on the gate being shut the night before, it is likely that someone hopped the fence to open it. If there was someone casing this house, they are now aware of a large amount of technology inside (personal computers with expensive accessories) and we are increasingly worried about a break-in. With all that being the case I wanted to touch base on the progress toward the security cameras that the landlord stated he wanted to install, and also the security of the front and garage doors, which are both in need of repair. Venkatesh has already fixed the lock on the front screen door but we are still awaiting the main door repairs. On top of this, the wood on the actual front door is still decaying in places.\n\nOn the topic of the construction, I would also like to inform Rent Select that the active construction sites have been left in place so long that the sites and items in them are starting to show signs of decay. I will attach photos of the front yard site and the backyard area where the gate is to be replaced. The baseboard that the back gate will be sitting on now shows signs of the same rot that could have contributed to the decay of the back gate.\n\nAt the front construction site. There has been rusty rebar sticking out of the ground very close to the neighbor's yard, and the actual structure Venkatesh is working to build is starting to fall apart due to weathering. On top of that, there is starting to be weed growth that I do not feel comfortable having removed from an active construction site with hazards such as rebar posts sticking out of the ground.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to mention is that, at this point in time, I am still not sure if the landlord intends to conduct repairs this weekend. It is currently Friday at 9 am, and I have not heard from him through the course of the week, aside from Monday when he said he'd be in touch. I assume he will be sorting other matters this weekend. He has informed me that Saturdays are the primary days he can come to attend to the repairs. I am happy to make myself available on those days, but I would still like to request more than 24 hours notice so that I can plan my weekend with certainty. I also understand that Venkatesh needs to make time to coordinate and plan for all of these repairs, but I respectfully request that the matters involving security be expedited."}]}

{"timestamp": 15556, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 639, "Output Length": 139, "prompt": "Please summarise this proposal\nFor the extended essay mathematics is my first choice, because I am a person who is very keen in learning and understanding problems and I believe that understanding something very difficult enables me to see the bigger and deeper mathematical picture. Furthermore, I want to study mathematics in America at university to then continue into medicine after my undergrad. Writing an EE on a topic so closely related to my mathematical road ahead, I believe, would showcase my knowledge to my future university application team. \nMy proposed topic fits into the \u201cthe elegance of mathematics in the proving of theorems\u201d category. I would like to explore either the proof of euler's formula or the proof of rationality of euler-mascheroni constant. In the first case this mathematical exploration would be heavy in the use of trigonometric identities, and logarithms. In the second case the proof is more based on limits, series and calculus. I already have basic knowledge on logarithms, trigonometric proofs/identities, limits and series. I still have not encountered calculus but I am willing to put my own time into learning it. \nTo succeed in the proof of any of the two series, I want to give detailed explanations and coherent step explanations of proofs, making sure I explain and understand the mathematics behind the proof. My question will be detailed enough to not go over the 4000 word essay,and will ensure that I understand the proof well. Furthermore I will give accurate and complete explanations of subject-specific terminology, will make knowledgeable comments on source material and will use source material in a relevant and appropriate way. I will also try to prove the theorems in the simplest way and the way that would more directly show my maths knowledge. The sources referenced would also display clear research skills and clear understanding of the topic. For criteria C I will make predictions and try to prove or disprove them. I will ensure that I use deductive reasoning and correct arguments to move from section to section of the mathematical proof. As both proofs require tables to fully understand the mathematical processes that make them true, I will make my own tables and explain them to the best of my mathematical abilities. As for my engagement, I believe that going beyond my class studies of mathematics shows a deep engagement with the subject. I will give reflections at multiple steps in the essay and reflect as a whole on the mathematics at the end. I will reflect on difficulties and new fields I have gained knowledge of. In conclusion I will also ensure to have someone answer my question in a mathematically relevant way. \nAs I have previously mentioned both proofs contain trigonometry, trigonometric identities, logarithms, limits, series and calculus. There are all units that should be present in my HL maths course but that I will need to explore further to be able to fully do. We introduce the topics in class but Euler and its proofs are not present in the curriculum. \nI have already found many maths blogs, Khan academy, and maths websites that explain the proofs step by step and that give an explanation of them. Khan academy is very useful to learn the content that I need to be able to understand the proof."}]}

He is a free spirit, not at all adhering to the expected behavior of Simian royalty. He regularly skips scheduled lessons and religious services to spend time outdoors on his own or with his best friend, Sanzang, a Simian peasant. He looks forward to the freedom of being king and enjoys his existing privileges as a prince, but resents the Simian priesthood for constantly telling him what to do. He loves to mess with them, knowing he can get away with it because of his privileged position. He doesn\u2019t care much about ranks and social standings, preferring to just have fun with anyone who\u2019s willing. He enjoys being with his \u201clower status\u201d friends simply because they let him feel normal and have fun without the constraints of royal etiquette.\n\nWukong stands about 4.5 feet tall and has a coat of soft light brown fur. He has golden eyes and a mischievous smile. He is relatively physically fit from being trained to fight from a young age, as well as having physically demanding hobbies such as climbing trees or play-fighting. He has a long tail that he frequently uses as an extra hand and that reflexively helps express his emotions.\n\nWukong wears a short-sleeved yellow silk shirt and red trousers, with a long red, green, and golden sash that winds around his chest and waist, with ends that hand loose over his back. He usually wears golden or brown sandals, but prefers to go barefoot when having fun outdoors. He very rarely wears his crown - a tiny golden cap that resembles the Monkey King\u2019s phoenix-feather cap, pinned into his fur - unless he\u2019s participating in a ceremony. He wears several chunky copper bracelets for good luck and to display his status, but usually takes those off when he can as they get in the way of tree climbing. He always carries an elaborately decorated bo staff with golden accents.\nSanzang\nSanzang is Wukong\u2019s best friend and a Simian peasant. He is a kind, gentle soul who tries his best to keep Wukong out of trouble, even though he often ends up going along with the prince\u2019s mischievous plans. He is very intelligent, but doesn\u2019t have the same opportunities as the prince because of his social status. He is a bit of a pushover and doesn\u2019t like confrontation, but he will stand up for what he believes in if he feels it\u2019s important enough.\n\nSanzang stands about 4.5 feet tall and has a coat of soft, dark brown fur. He has deep brown eyes and a warm smile. He is relatively physically fit from helping out with the family farm, but is not as strong or fast as Wukong or other fighters. He has a long tail that he frequently uses as an extra hand and that reflexively helps express his emotions.\n\nSanzang wears a short-sleeved white linen shirt and brown trousers, with a long brown sash that winds around his waist. He usually wears brown sandals, but prefers to go barefoot when he can. He very rarely wears any jewelry, as he doesn\u2019t have the money to afford it.\nAshira\nAshira is a low-ranking member of the Simian priesthood in her late teens, about the same age as Wukong. She is shy and quiet, but a hard worker. She tries to fulfill her temple duties as quickly and as perfectly as possible, both to please the gods whom she is fully devoted to, and to keep the priests from being angry with her. She is usually melancholy as the priests tend to treat her poorly. But she is devoted to the gods, and when she is able to worship, she is peaceful and happy.\n\nAshira\u2019s personality begins to shift as Wukong spends more time in the temple, taking lessons that will help him when he\u2019s king. She\u2019s both fascinated by and scared of him and his high status, and is stunned when he\u2019s as friendly and playful toward her as he is with anyone else. After she makes a mistake during a religious ritual, one of the priests is about to scold her until Wukong steps in and tells the priest to leave her alone. Ashira\u2019s respect for the prince grows, and she begins secretly meeting with him when the priests aren\u2019t around. Gradually she falls in love with him, and though she isn\u2019t quite sure, she thinks he feels the same way. She slowly begins to gain self-confidence and begins to wonder why she has to obey the priests all the time if they\u2019re not always right.\n\nAshira stands about 4 feet tall and has very soft light blond flaxen fur, which she grows longer on her head. She has a long tail that she rarely uses as an additional limb in the temple, but begins to form the habit as she does activities outside. She isn\u2019t very fit as she was born into a very sedentary role in life, but she isn\u2019t weak or frail.

As infants explore their\nworld, they generally rely on the emotional\nexpressions of their mothers or caregivers to\ndetermine the safety or appropriateness of a\nparticular endeavour. ---- Are infants simply\nimitating their mother\u2019s emotional responses, or do\nthey actually experience a change in mood purely\nfrom the expressive visual cues of the mother?\nWhat is known, however, is that as infants explore\ntheir environment, their emotional responses to\nwhat they encounter are based on cues portrayed by\ntheir mother or primary caregiver.\n\nA)During the second year, infants express emotions of\nshame or embarrassment and pride, which are greatly\ndeveloped with the help of adults.\n\nB)Parents, however, are one of the primary sources that\nsocialise children to communicate emotional\nexperience in culturally specific ways.\n\nC)Some scientists claim that infants may fail to react to a\nthreat in an appropriate way because it is usually\ndifficult for them to appreciate inputs.\n\nD)Although this process has been established by several\nstudies, there is some debate about how infants do it.\n\nE)Most infants, on the other hand, pay close attention to\nthe events that take place in their environment,\nparticularly after the first month.\n74.For centuries, people have bred microorganisms for\nthe production of foods such as cheese and yogurt.\nGenetic technology takes this process a step further\nby manipulating specific genes for practical\napplications in research, medicine, and agriculture.\nThe manipulation of genes resulted in hundreds of\nnew products at the beginning of the 21st century.\n---- The tools used by scientists in this process\ninclude DNA-splitting enzymes and host organisms\nincluding a range of bacteria.\n\nA)Usually, one gene prevails over the other and is thus\ncalled the dominant gene that supresses the other.\n\nB)Currently there are a number of technologies that use\ngenetic engineering.\n\nC)Genes are individual segments of DNA within\nchromosomes and are known to affect all human\ntraits.\n\nD)Reproduction entails a copy of a gene from the father\nand a gene from the mother joining together.\n\nE)Genes from different species are often combined by\ninserting a gene from one organism into another.\n75.Striving to eat healthily can, ironically, become an\nunhealthy obsession.

The `EditableMol` class allows you to modify the molecule in place, which is useful for efficiently adding and removing atoms and bonds.\n\nHere is an updated code example that uses these RDKit functions:\n```python\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n\n# Define the input reaction and the selected operator\ninput_rxn = Chem.MolFromSmiles('CCCO>>CCC=O')\nselected_op = Chem.MolFromSmarts('[C:1][O:2]>>[C:1]=[O:2]')\n\n# Perform substructure search to identify reactants in input reaction\nreactants = AllChem.ReactionUtils.ReactantsFromReaction(selected_op, input_rxn)\n\n# Transfer the atom maps from the operator to the corresponding atoms in the input reaction\nfor reactant in reactants:\n    edit_reactant = Chem.EditableMol(reactant)\n    for bond in selected_op.GetBonds():\n        begin_idx = bond.GetBeginAtom().GetAtomMapNum()\n        end_idx = bond.GetEndAtom().GetAtomMapNum()\n        if begin_idx > 0 and end_idx > 0:\n            begin_map = reactant.GetAtomWithIdx(begin_idx)\n            end_map = reactant.GetAtomWithIdx(end_idx)\n            if begin_map is not None and end_map is not None:\n                edit_reactant.AddBond(begin_map.GetIdx(), end_map.GetIdx(), bond.GetBondType())\n                begin_map.SetProp('molAtomMapNumber', str(begin_idx))\n                end_map.SetProp('molAtomMapNumber', str(end_idx))\n    edited_reactant = edit_reactant.GetMol()\n    edited_reactant.UpdatePropertyCache(strict=False)\n    edited_reactant = Chem.RemoveHs(edited_reactant)\n    print(Chem.MolToSmiles(edited_reactant))\n```\nIn this updated code, we first perform a substructure search using `AllChem.ReactionUtils.ReactantsFromReaction` to identify the reactants in the input reaction that match the substrates of the selected operator.\n\nWe then use the `EditableMol` class to create a modifiable version of each reactant. We iterate over the bonds in the selected operator and transfer the atom maps to the corresponding atoms in the reactant using `AddBond` and `SetProp` methods. We then create a final version of the edited reactant by calling `GetMol`, updating the property cache, and removing any implicit hydrogens using `RemoveHs`. Finally, we print the result as a SMILES string using `Chem.MolToSmiles`.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the selected operator has only one set of substrates, which is the case in your example.

LinkedIn also provides learning opportunities and certification programs to help workers upskill and stay competitive in the job market.\n\nEach of these players has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Udacity has a strong focus on tech skills and digital transformation, but may not have the same level of experience and expertise in talent development as Codestates. Coursera has a wide range of courses and partnerships, but may not have the same level of customization and personalization as Codestates.

To build an RC filter with a 3kHz -3dB bandwidth in SPICE and plot the frequency response from 1Hz to 100kHz, you can use the following SPICE code:\n```\n* RC filter circuit with a 3kHz bandwidth\nV1 1 0 10   ; 10V source\nR1 1 2 4.7k ; 4.7 kilohm resistor\nC1 2 0 330p ; 330 picofarad capacitor\n\n* Connect negative end of voltage source to ground\nGND 0 0\n\n* Perform AC analysis of RC filter circuit\n.AC DEC 1 100k\n.PLOT AC V(2)\n.END\n```\nThis SPICE code defines a voltage source (V1) with a voltage of 10V, a resistor (R1) with a resistance of 4.7 kilohms, and a capacitor (C1) with a capacitance of 330 picofarads. The voltage source is connected between nodes 1 and 0, and the resistor (R1) is connected between nodes 1 and 2. The capacitor (C1) is connected between nodes 2 and 0. Node 0 represents the ground node in this circuit.\n\nTo plot the frequency response of this circuit, the `AC` analysis is used with a frequency sweep from 1 Hz to 100 kHz in decade increments (logarithmic scale). The `.PLOT` command will plot the voltage at node 2 (V(2)) at each frequency point. The `.END` command indicates the end of the analysis.\n\nThe -3dB bandwidth of the RC filter can be determined by looking for the frequency at which the voltage at node 2 is 3 dB below the maximum value. The -3dB bandwidth is the range of frequencies where the voltage at node 2 is within 3 dB of the maximum value. In this case, the -3dB bandwidth of the RC filter should be around 3 kHz.\n\nTo calculate the values of R and C used in the circuit to achieve a 3kHz -3dB bandwidth, we can use the following formula:\n\n-3dB bandwidth = 1 / (2 \\* pi \\* R \\* C)\n\nSubstituting the desired -3dB bandwidth of 3 kHz and solving for R, we get:\n\nR = 1 / (2 \\* pi \\* 3kHz \\* C)\n= 1 / (2 \\* pi \\* 3000 \\* C)\n= 1 / (6283 \\* C)\n\nTo solve for C, we can substitute the value of R in the above formula:\n\nC = 1 / (2 \\* pi \\* R \\* 3kHz)\n= 1 / (2 \\* pi \\* 4.7k \\* 3kHz)\n= 1 / (6283 \\* 4.7k)\n= 330p\n\nSo, to achieve a 3kHz -3dB bandwidth, we can use a resistor of 4.7 kilohms and a capacitor of 330 picofarads.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."}]}
{"timestamp": 16436, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 799, "Output Length": 40, "prompt": "Sure, here's an example of how we can add object recognition and classification using computer vision techniques to the drone swarm system:\n\n1. Preprocessing the Images: We first need to preprocess the images captured by the drones, to ensure that they are in the correct format and size for our deep learning model. We can resize the images to a standard size and convert them to grayscale to reduce the computational cost of our model. Here's an example of how we can do this in Python using the OpenCV library:\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# Read an image captured by the drone\nimg = cv2.imread('drone_image.jpg')\n\n# Convert the image to grayscale\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n\n# Resize the image to a standard size\nresized = cv2.resize(gray, (224, 224))\n```\n1. Object Detection: Next, we can use an object detection model, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), to detect objects in the image. YOLO is a real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in a single image. Here's an example of how we can use the YOLOv3 model in Python using the OpenCV library:\n```python\n# Load the YOLOv3 model\nnet = cv2.dnn.readNet('yolov3.weights', 'yolov3.cfg')\n\n# Load the class names\nclasses = []\nwith open('coco.names', 'r') as f:\n    classes = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]\n\n# Get the output layer names\nlayer_names = net.getLayerNames()\noutput_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]\n\n# Perform object detection on the image\nblob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(resized, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)\nnet.setInput(blob)\nouts = net.forward(output_layers)\n\n# Loop over the detected objects and draw bounding boxes around them\nfor out in outs:\n    for detection in out:\n        scores = detection[5:]\n        class_id = np.argmax(scores)\n        confidence = scores[class_id]\n        if confidence > 0.5:\n            center_x = int(detection[0] * 224)\n            center_y = int(detection[1] * 224)\n            w = int(detection[2] * 224)\n            h = int(detection[3] * 224)\n            x = int(center_x - w / 2)\n            y = int(center_y - h / 2)\n            cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)\n            label = f'{classes[class_id]}: {confidence:.2f}'\n            cv2.putText(img, label, (x, y - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 1)\n```\n1. Object Classification: Once we have detected objects in the image, we can use a deep learning model to classify them. For example, we can use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as VGG16 or ResNet, to classify objects into different categories. Here's an example of how we can use the VGG16 model in Python using the Keras library:\n```python\nfrom keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16, preprocess_input\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array\n\n# Load the VGG16 model\nmodel = VGG16(weights='imagenet')\n\n# Pre\n```"}]}

Selling the house now:\n\nIf you sell the house for $2.8 million, you will get $2.8 million - $1.35 million (remaining mortgage) = $1.45 million in cash.\n\nAssuming you invest this amount in a different investment that yields an average annual return of 7% over the next 9 years:\n\nFuture value of the investment = $1,450,000 \\* (1 + 0.07)^9 \u2248 $2,563,264\n\n1. Renting the house:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the potential appreciation of the property. Assuming the property appreciates at a rate of 4% per year:\n\nFuture value of the property = $2,800,000 \\* (1 + 0.04)^9 \u2248 $3,997,553\n\nNext, we'll estimate the rental income. Using the previous calculation with the new mortgage payment of $5,500 a month, we need to adjust the required rent:\n\nAdjusted required rent = $12,792 - $7,400 (previous opportunity cost) + ($5,500 - $8,529) (difference in mortgage payment) \u2248 $9,263 per month\n\nTotal rental income over 9 years:\n\n$9,263 \\* 12 months \\* 9 years = $1,001,676\n\nNow, let's calculate the mortgage payments over the 9-year period with the new mortgage payment of $5,500 a month. Over 9 years:\n\nMortgage payments = $5,500 \\* 12 months \\* 9 years = $594,000\n\nAfter 9 years, you would have paid off a portion of the principal on your mortgage. To find the remaining mortgage balance after 9 years, you can use a mortgage amortization calculator or consult with a financial advisor. For simplicity, let's assume the remaining mortgage balance is approximately $850,000.\n\nEquity in the property after 9 years:\n\nEquity = Future value of the property - Remaining mortgage balance = $3,997,553 - $850,000 \u2248 $3,147,553\n\nTotal potential returns from renting:\n\nRental income + Equity in the property after 9 years = $1,001,676 + $3,147,553 \u2248 $4,149,229\n\nComparing both scenarios:\n\n1. Selling the house now and investing the proceeds: $2,563,264\n2. Renting the house for 9 years: $4,149,229\n\nBased on these revised calculations, it still appears that renting the house for the next 9 years could potentially result in higher returns. However, this analysis does not take into account factors like tax implications, rental vacancy rates, and potential changes in interest rates or market conditions. You should consult with a financial advisor to get more tailored advice based on your specific situation."}]}

However, the current market is fragmented and lacks transparency, with multiple standards bodies and certification processes that can make it difficult for buyers to confidently purchase offsets.\nWe propose Eco, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning to create a transparent and standardized carbon offset registry. Eco will use a forward selling model, where buyers can purchase carbon offsets in advance of their being issued, providing an additional incentive for project developers to participate in the ecosystem. By aggregating offsets in smart contracts, Eco will enable the creation of liquid carbon tokens that can be traded and used as a building block for other applications on the Web3 platform.\nIn this white paper, we outline the technical details of the Eco project, including the DAO structure, the token economics, and the technology that will be used to create the world's first decentralized autonomous carbon offset registry. We also compare Eco to existing solutions and demonstrate how it is superior in terms of transparency, standardization, and scalability.\nIntroduction\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities leading to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. To mitigate the impacts of climate change, it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove carbon from the atmosphere.\nOne way to do this is through the voluntary carbon offset market, where companies and individuals can offset their emissions by purchasing credits from projects that reduce or remove carbon. These projects can include reforestation, carbon capture and storage, and renewable energy generation.\nHowever, the current voluntary carbon offset market is fragmented, with multiple standards bodies and certification processes that can make it difficult for buyers to confidently purchase offsets. There is also a lack of transparency, as it can be difficult for buyers to verify the authenticity and impact of the offsets they are purchasing.\nTo address these issues, we propose Eco, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning to create a transparent and standardized carbon offset registry. Eco will use a forward selling model, where buyers can purchase carbon offsets in advance of their being issued, providing an additional incentive for project developers to participate in the ecosystem. By aggregating offsets in smart contracts, Eco will enable the creation of liquid carbon tokens that can be traded and used as a building block for other applications on the Web3 platform.\nIn the following sections, we will describe the technical details of the Eco project, including the DAO structure, the token economics, and the technology that will be used. We will also compare Eco to existing solutions and demonstrate how it is superior in terms of transparency, standardization, and scalability.\nEco: A Decentralized Autonomous Carbon Offset Registry\nDAO Structure\nEco will be a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Polygon blockchain, an EVM-compatible blockchain running on an energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. The DAO will be governed by a set of smart contracts that enable the creation and trade of carbon offsets on the Web3 platform.\nCarbon Bridge\nEco will provide an on-\nit got stock\nI apologize for the delay in getting the white paper to you. I have prepared a white paper based on our previous conversations and have included it below. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any further assistance.\n\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry is a revolutionary new approach to carbon offsetting that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning to create a decentralized, autonomous registry for carbon offsets. By leveraging the power of the blockchain and the efficiency of AI, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry aims to streamline the carbon offset process and make it more transparent, efficient, and cost-effective.\nThe Problem\nCarbon offsetting has become an increasingly popular way for individuals and organizations to offset their carbon emissions and mitigate their impact on the environment. However, the current carbon offset market is riddled with problems.\nOne major issue is the lack of transparency and standardization in the carbon offset market. Many carbon offset projects are unverified, making it difficult for individuals and organizations to trust that their offsets are genuine. Additionally, there is no central authority overseeing the carbon offset market, leading to a lack of standardization and consistency in the offsets that are available.\nAnother issue is the high cost and complexity of carbon offsetting. The current process for purchasing offsets is often convoluted and time-consuming, making it difficult for individuals and organizations to easily offset their emissions. Additionally, the high cost of offsets can be a barrier to entry for many individuals and organizations, making it difficult for them to participate in the carbon offset market.\nThe Solution\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry aims to address these issues by creating a decentralized, autonomous registry for carbon offsets that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning.\nThrough the use of smart contracts, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry will create a transparent, secure, and efficient platform for carbon offsets. Smart contracts will be used to automate the process of purchasing, verifying, and tracking carbon offsets, making it easy for individuals and organizations to participate in the carbon offset market.\nIn addition to smart contracts, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry will utilize machine learning to streamline the carbon offset process. By analyzing data from various sources, including aerial data from drone surveys, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry will be able to accurately and efficiently verify carbon offset projects and ensure that offsets are genuine and effective.\nThe Benefits\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry offers a number of benefits to individuals and organizations looking to offset their carbon emissions.\nFirst and foremost, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry offers a high level of transparency and trust. By utilizing smart contracts and machine learning, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry is able to verify and track carbon offsets in a transparent and secure manner, making it easy for individuals and organizations to trust that their offsets are genuine.\nIn addition to transparency and trust, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry offers a more efficient and cost-effective approach to carbon offsetting. By automating the process of purchasing and verifying offsets through smart contracts, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry is able to streamline the offset process and make it more accessible to a wider range of individuals and organizations.\nFinally, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry offers a scalable and sustainable solution to carbon offsetting. By utilizing the blockchain and AI, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry is able to efficiently verify and track a large number of carbon offsets, making it an effective solution for offsetting carbon emissions on a large scale.\nThe Future\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry represents a new approach to carbon offsetting that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning to create a decentralized, autonomous registry for carbon offsets\nis this the full white paper ?"}]}

{"timestamp": 16613, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 732, "Output Length": 48, "prompt": "Sure, here is an example of how to implement user authentication and authorization in your MERN stack web application:\n\n1. Create a user model: First, create a user model in your MongoDB database to store user data, such as email and password. You can use a package like `bcrypt` to hash passwords before storing them in the database.\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst bcrypt = require('bcrypt');\n\nconst userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },\n  password: { type: String, required: true },\n});\n\nuserSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {\n  const user = this;\n  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();\n  const hash = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10);\n  user.password = hash;\n  next();\n});\n\nconst User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);\n\nmodule.exports = User;\n```\n2. Implement a login route: Next, create a login route that allows users to log in and receive an authentication token. You can use a package like `jsonwebtoken` to generate and verify tokens.\n```php\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bcrypt = require('bcrypt');\nconst jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');\nconst User = require('../models/user');\n\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.post('/login', async (req, res) => {\n  const { email, password } = req.body;\n\n  const user = await User.findOne({ email });\n  if (!user) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid email or password' });\n  }\n\n  const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);\n  if (!isMatch) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid email or password' });\n  }\n\n  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, 'secret');\n  res.json({ token });\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n3. Implement authorization middleware: Finally, implement a middleware function that verifies the authentication token and adds the user ID to the request object.

Facilitating the Exploration of Chemical Space\n\nAI-driven retrosynthetic analysis techniques have shown great potential in facilitating the exploration of chemical space, enabling the discovery of novel molecules and reactions with desirable properties (308, 309). By leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches, these methods can generate new chemical structures, predict synthetic routes, and guide the design of novel compounds with optimized physicochemical and pharmacological properties (310, 311). This section discusses key advancements in AI-driven retrosynthetic analysis for facilitating the exploration of chemical space, with a focus on recent studies from the past five years.\n\n1. De novo molecular design: AI-driven methods, such as generative models and reinforcement learning techniques, have been applied to de novo molecular design to generate novel chemical structures that satisfy specific criteria, expanding the exploration of chemical space (312, 313). For example, the work by Olivecrona et al. (314) employed a generative model to design novel bioactive molecules with optimized drug-like properties.\n2. Reaction prediction and discovery: AI-driven retrosynthetic analysis techniques have been used to predict novel reactions and discover new synthetic routes, enabling the exploration of previously uncharted areas of chemical space (315, 316). In a study by Segler et al. (317), a deep learning model was employed to predict novel reactions and identify previously unexplored synthetic routes for target molecules.\n3. Scaffold hopping: AI-driven methods have facilitated scaffold hopping, the process of identifying novel molecular scaffolds with similar biological activity to a known active compound, which allows for the exploration of new regions of chemical space (318, 319). The work by Jin et al. (320) used a graph-based generative model to perform scaffold hopping and generate novel bioactive molecules with improved properties.\n4. Multitask learning: Multitask learning techniques have been applied to AI-driven retrosynthetic analysis methods to simultaneously predict multiple molecular properties, facilitating the exploration of chemical space with respect to various desirable characteristics (321, 322). The work by Ramsundar et al. (323) demonstrated that multitask learning models could predict various molecular properties, guiding the design of compounds with optimized characteristics.\n5. Integration with experimental data: AI-driven retrosynthetic analysis methods have been integrated with experimental data, such as high-throughput screening results and reaction databases, to guide the exploration of chemical space and enable the discovery of novel compounds and reactions (324, 325). The work by Gao et al. (326) combined machine learning models with high-throughput reaction data to explore chemical space and predict novel reactions with desirable properties.\n\nThese advancements in AI-driven retrosynthetic analysis have significantly contributed to facilitating the exploration of chemical space, enabling the discovery of novel molecules and reactions, and ultimately accelerating the pace of discovery in organic synthesis and related fields (327, 328).\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

We've created two div elements with the classes `swiper-button-prev` and `swiper-button-next`, and added custom styles to them to create circular buttons with a gradient background and an arrow icon inside.\n\nWe've also added custom styles to the arrow icons using SVG markup. In this example, we're using the Feather icons library to add arrow icons to the buttons, but you can use any icon library or custom SVG markup that you prefer.\n\nTo change the color of the buttons, you can modify the `from-blue-600` and `to-purple-600` classes to use different colors or gradients. Swiper.js uses CSS classes to style its components, so you can easily modify the styles using your preferred CSS framework or custom styles."}]}

We needed to get those cables from one side of the Aire Sea to the other, and boats and airships just wouldn't cut it.\"\n\n\"So how did you do it?\" the dwelf pressed, her eyes fixed on the old dwarf's animated face.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, gripping his mug tightly. \"Magic, my dear, magic! But not just any magic. We had a team of brilliant mage engineers, experts in their craft, who devised an ingenious plan.\"\n\nThe other patrons snickered and exchanged skeptical looks, but the dwelf bartender remained undeterred. \"Tell me more,\" she urged.\n\nThe old dwarf beamed, basking in the attention. \"These mage engineers, they enchanted the very cables themselves.

The falcons gripped the cable with their talons and flew over the rift, guided by the wind magic,\" he explained, his eyes distant as he recalled the memory. \"Once the cables reached the other side, we used a system of pulleys and weights to pull them taut and anchor them to the rock faces of the Isles.\"\n\nThe dwelf raised her eyebrows, clearly impressed. \"And it worked?\"\n\nThe old dwarf's chest swelled with pride. \"Worked like a charm, my dear.

{"timestamp": 16665, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1438, "Output Length": 23, "prompt": "Remember: \"Optional reflection \n\n1. What were your reactions to and key learnings/takeaways from the World Fellows panel discussion? How did their stories or careers as global leaders resonate with your own past experiences or future aspirations? \nOne of my key takeaways came from Alex Mu\u00f1oz Wilson. He said (roughly): \"Take care of yourself and share your journey with others. No one can achieve much without building a great team around you and taking care of yourself. Acknowledge that you have a limit.\" This resonated with me on a various levels. First, I recognized myself in his experience regarding taking care of yourself. I myself have a tendency to push beyond my limits too often, and I seem to be making this error time and time again which implies a lack of learning from mistakes. Even after having having recovered following a period of overstretching myself physically and mentally, I act as if nothing has happened and carry on where I left off. I feel that I must learn from reaching my limits and even more so design my environment such that I prevent going beyond them. Second, I really liked how he connected this insight into his own limits to building a team around himself. Not only does the presence of people with different skillsets help fill gaps in your own, but it also means you can fall back on a support network when needed. I recognize the need for doing this and simultaneously my own resistance to building support networks around myself. This last point is very interesting since I am perfectly aware that it would be better to do so yet I still cannot seem to transform that realization into practice. Third, it was interesting how he shared his perspective on experiencing a process alone versus with others. This was an angle I had not necessarily thought of myself and showed me a unique value that doing something with others provides. Reflecting on my own life, I have learned first hand that by experiencing major life events individually you miss an opportunity get closer with other people. I suppose it are indeed often shared experiences that create a bond between people and I would like to make use of these opportunities to foster connection with others in the future. \n \n2. In reflecting on your progress on your learning goals to date, what would you like to practice in the remaining days before this course concludes? What would represent a risk or stretch for you \u2013 something at least slightly out of your comfort zone? How will you apply and expand your learning with intention up to the very end of this course?\n \nIn the remaining days before this course I would like to spend some time on improving on the learnings goals I set at the beginning of this course: being better at empowering others. A risk here is that it should really be about empowering others and not me saying something to someone so that I can feel better about myself. I am not someone who gives compliments are praise very easily, and I get slightly awkward when receiving it myself as well, so this forms an obstacle for me. Drawing from question three, however, I believe I have an opportunity to empower someone with genuine intentions and valuable insights into that person. I think this could be an excellent opportunity to expand my learning with intention up to the very end of this course.\n3. Do you have any opinions, judgments, or insights into a teammate\u2019s impact on you/in your team that have not yet been communicated to that person? Why or why not? Would you want to know that information if the roles were reversed? Why or why not? How do you think through potential feedback to decide whether/when/how to share it? \nMy small learning team member Cathy has had a big impact on my experience of this course. Apart from briefly mentioning in a group setting the fact that the story she told during one of our meetings impressed me, I have not shared it with her on a personal level. I think she is an exceptional storyteller and speaker, which was again confirmed to me when we presented together during another course on Monday this week, and I feel she has all the right to speak up more than her seemingly naturally introverted disposition allows her. If it were me, I would like to know that information because it might help me to take more initiative and showcase a talent that also can inspire others. Thus, I feel I should share it with her. I have thought about simply being honest and telling her that her story stuck with me and that I think she has a real talent for storytelling that she, in my opinion, could practice more often. I do not know Cathy that well but I believe that she would potentially appreciate this feedback.\n \n4. How satisfied are you with the progress on your Global Impact team project so far? How does it match or differ from what you would have accomplished independently? What role have you played in shaping that final product? What might you do differently if you had to do it over again?\nI am relatively satisfied with the progress we made so far. Since it is Wednesday already, we have finished the project by now and so I am commenting on the finished product. I do believe that we have accomplished much more than I would have been able to accomplish on my own. In particular, I have observed the impact of teammates I know have different preferred thinking styles. Being a dominant L2 thinker, for example, Sarah often sped up processes that would otherwise have remained in my R1 big picture thinking. This is only one example of many where complementarity allowed the team to accomplish more than its individual members would have accomplished alone. As to my own role, I believe I contributed by taking up a task, for instance, that most people did not want to take and simultaneously aligned with my qualities. I am happy that I was able to contribute to the final product in a way that allowed me to fill a gap in the team, which I believe is evidence for the importance of (skills) complementarity in teams. If I had to do it over again, I would like to take more initiative on the project though. Also, I feel that I might have fallen short on a team goal that I proposed myself: to check in with the team and reflect on the team process so far. So, next time I would like to follow through on that intention more conscientiously.\n \n5. What question has not yet been asked that you would like to reflect on in the context of these journal assignments? (What question have you asked yourself that has led to additional personal insight during this course)? How would you answer it this week?\nPerhaps a question regarding what you believe are coping mechanisms you use to handle stress and difficult situations, and how can I improve upon those. The nature of this question, I believe, also lends itself for weekly reflection and improvement. This week, I would answer it by saying that I believe my coping mechanism for handling stress is withdrawing from group processes and work more in isolation, especially during exam weeks. I would improve on that by forcing myself to open up and collaborate. I would accomplish this by asking a group member to work together on a set date, and make this appointment before the stress (of exam week) that activates my coping mechanism sets in. \""}]}

The function can be a built-in Python function, a user-defined function, or a lambda function. The `apply` method returns a new DataFrame with the results of applying the function to each element.\n\nHere's an example to demonstrate the use of the `apply` method:\n```bash\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Jim', 'Joan'],\n        'Age': [26, 24, 28, 27]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Use the apply method to add 1 to each element in the Age column\ndf['Age'] = df['Age'].apply(lambda x: x + 1)\nprint(df)\n\n# Output:\n#    Name  Age\n# 0  John   27\n# 1  Jane   25\n# 2   Jim   29\n# 3  Joan   28\n\n# Use the apply method to convert each element in the Name column to upper case\ndf['Name'] = df['Name'].apply(lambda x: x.upper())\nprint(df)\n\n# Output:\n#    Name  Age\n# 0  JOHN   27\n# 1  JANE   25\n# 2   JIM   29\n# 3  JOAN   28\n```\nIn this example, the `apply` method is used to add 1 to each element in the `Age` column and to convert each element in the `Name` column to upper case. The first line of code uses a lambda function that takes a single argument `x` and returns `x + 1`. The `apply` method applies this lambda function to each element in the `Age` column, and the result is stored in the same column. The second line of code uses a similar lambda function to convert each element in the `Name` column to upper case.\n\nThe `apply` method can also be used with a user-defined function instead of a lambda function. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {'Number': [1, 2, 3, 4]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Define a user-defined function\ndef square_root(x):\n    return x ** 0.5\n\n# Use the apply method to apply the user-defined function to each element in the Number column\ndf['Square Root'] = df['Number'].apply(square_root)\nprint(df)\n\n# Output:\n#   Number  Square Root\n# 0       1    1.000000\n# 1       2    1.414214\n# 2       3    1.732051\n# 3       4    2.000000\n```\nIn this example, the `apply` method is used to apply the user-defined function `square_root` to each element in the `Number` column. The `square_root` function takes a single argument `x` and returns `x ** 0.5`, which is the square root of `x`. The result of applying the function to each element is stored in a new column `Square Root`."}]}

{"timestamp": 16755, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1064, "Output Length": 21, "prompt": "The Spine \nOkay, that\u2019s the child\u2019s version of the spinal cord or superhighway of nerves. Now we get to talk about the spine\u2014the bones and discs\u2014which is actually the foundation upon which your body is built. The keel of your boat, or however you want to think of it. And its extraordinary gift is that, unlike the keel of your boat or the foundation of your house, it is flexible. Actually, it is better than that: It is rigid, much of the time. Which allows you to sit and stand upright and be stable, even under great pressure, while the hips and shoulders allow you to move and perform tasks. But it can also bend, forward and back and from side to side, when you need it to do that. And even twist a little. Amazing. It is \u201carticulated\u201d like a linked chain. Which is to say, it is made up of a bunch of pieces and they let you flex. The individual pieces are the bones, called vertebrae\u2014some thirty-three of them\u2014stacked on top of each other with semisoft shock absorbers or \u201cdiscs\u201d in between them. The spine is divided into sections based on the curvature of the spine in each section. The four sections are the cervical spine (neck), thoracic spine (upper and mid back), lumbar spine (lower back), and sacrum and coccyx (tailbone). Different nerves stem out of the spine at different places and go on to regulate specific parts of your body. This may interest me more than most, but that\u2019s why, if you break your back and damage your spine up high, almost all the nerves are affected and almost nothing \u201cworks\u201d\u2014you are apt to be a quadriplegic. If the damage happens lower down, your upper body works okay, but you can\u2019t walk. If it happens really high on your neck, you can\u2019t breathe; you\u2019re on a respirator. \nAll the bones in the spine are movable and have discs in between them except the sacrum and coccyx, which are fused or sealed together (no discs for them, of course). The discs, which we\u2019ll come to in a moment, are, according to Jeremy, \u201cmade up of a fibrous outer layer, which resists fraying or breaking under normal conditions, and an inner liquid core called the nucleus pulposus, which gives the discs the ability to distribute loads evenly throughout the discs and resist compressive forces.\u201d I like to think of them as very tough jelly doughnuts: They are tough on the outside and have goo or jelly on the inside, so they can give with pressure and rebound. They can be compressed, angled, and so on, but not endlessly. We\u2019ll come back to that in a moment. Abused or bulging discs can hurt like crazy. Ruptured discs are much worse.\nHere is an important home truth. The whole spine is articulated but not to the same degree. Most urgently, your lower or lumbar spine\u2014the area that most often gets messed up\u2014isn\u2019t meant to handle loads in flexed or rotated positions. Do those words make any sense to you? What they mean, in the end, is Don\u2019t bend, lift, and twist with your lower back. There. That is one of the most important lessons in the book. Your lumbar spine is designed to hold you up, almost as if it were fused. We need to have some movement in there, but not much, and certainly not with loads, especially repetitive loads. The little muscles around it are meant to keep it stable, not to lift things, and so on.\nPut it this way, as if it came from the Decalogue: Thou shalt not rotate with thy lower back. Rotate with your hips, not your lower back. How do you rotate with your hips instead of your lower back? Easy. We will show you. \nThe Vertebrae\n\nTHE HOLY GRAIL \nAgain, we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves, but the simple picture above shows the neutral spine position. That\u2019s the Holy Grail in this book\u2014maintaining a neutral spine. This is the way you want to carry yourself, almost all the time. Jeremy will talk about it in greater detail, but this is the safest, strongest, and most effective way to carry yourself and support loads. It may be a slight surprise, but \u201cstanding up straight\u201d does not mean your neutral or ideal spine is straight: it is a series of natural curves. Why? Who knows. Ask a structural engineer, preferably a suspension bridge builder. What I have learned from Jeremy (and Bill, before him) is that this is the ideal, and it is worth going to a tremendous amount of trouble to get into the habit of carrying yourself in this position.I now think about it all the time\u2014sitting, walking, riding my bike, in spin class\u2014all the time. I can feel it, when I am in the right posture; it feels good. And, it turns out, that\u2019s a blessing. If you take good care of your neutral spine, it will go very far indeed toward taking care of you. \nIT\u2019S HOLLOW!"}]}

Yes, basically, the Tiamat field caused USA and Canada to become third world countries overnight, and to lose massive amounts of population to sudden death caused by the immediate EMP ( crashes, hospital deaths etc. ), and then to mass migration, food shortages in the cities etc. So the US and Canadian governments still exist, but their influence is very limited in the remaining cities which weren't immediately ruined by the EMP. Alaska has formed its own government which only nominally continues the USA sovereignty, but in the subsequent elections, the ruling parties in Alaska are anti-migration, and mostly ( de facto ) fascist. The wave of almost 250 million refugees and migrants from USA has caused the government of Mexico to fall, and the local militias to form their own independent governments which are basically all fascist and ruthless towards migrants from the USA. The rest of Latin America has suffered from these events economically, so there was a domino effect, and most of the governments have become fascist or totalitarian. \n\nEuropean countries have also gone to extremes because of the large influx of refugees, and the countries which most relied on USA for economy had suffered massive economic crisis ( Ireland, UK, Germany etc. help me with some data pls ). Russia has become a more central player during these events, but with the outside pressure of USA faltering, the local Russian politicians have become more ambitious and disunited ( without a strong enemy, there was no need for a one strong leader in Russia ), so this caused Russia and many ex-USSR countries to become semi-independent from Moscow. Japan had also suffered economically, so China quickly took over Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam ( only nominally leaving them as a sovereign nations ). \nBased on your outline, it's clear that the Tiamat event has had profound global consequences, leading to a shift in power dynamics and the rise of extremist governments. Here are some additional details and world-building elements to consider:\n\nEconomic Impact on European Countries: The sudden collapse of the US and Canadian economies would have had a ripple effect on their trading partners. Countries with strong economic ties to the US and Canada, like the UK, Germany, and Ireland, would have experienced severe financial crises. This could result in high unemployment rates, currency devaluation, and increased poverty.\n\nOther European countries might also experience similar issues, with some nations becoming more isolationist or nationalist in response to the crisis. The European Union could struggle to maintain unity among its member states, and its influence might wane as individual countries focus on their own interests and survival.\n\nAfrican and Middle Eastern Countries: The shift in global power dynamics could lead to increased instability in Africa and the Middle East. As the US and other Western powers lose their influence, regional powers may rise and compete for dominance. This could lead to new alliances, rivalries, and conflicts over resources and territory.\n\nIndia and Southeast Asia: The power vacuum created by the collapse of the US and the rise of China could also impact India and Southeast Asia. India might assert itself as a regional power to counterbalance China's growing influence, leading to increased tensions and potential conflicts between the two nations. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore could experience political and economic turmoil as they navigate the new geopolitical landscape.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand: Given their geographic isolation, Australia and New Zealand might fare better than other nations in terms of political stability. However, they would still be affected by the global economic downturn and would need to forge new alliances and trade partnerships to maintain their prosperity.\n\nClimate Change and Environmental Issues: With the chaos and upheaval caused by the Tiamat event, global efforts to address climate change and other environmental issues could be severely hampered. This might lead to worsening environmental conditions and more frequent natural disasters, further compounding the challenges faced by the survivors of the Tiamat event.\n\nThese additional details and considerations can help you further develop your post-apocalyptic world, highlighting the complex global consequences of the Tiamat event and creating a rich, immersive setting for your novel.\n\n\nPetar B\n8. inside the Tiamat field, the nature took over cities and human settlements. Animals are unaffected by the field, and many humans survived / returned to the zone, basically living without electricity, sort of like the Amish, or people in the XIX century. But these agricultural settlements are often attacked by the technologically advanced polities from the east and west coast and former Mexico. There are also raiders who live inside the tiamat field, using whatever weapons they can use, older cars ( which are less reliable, as the field seems to mess with sparkplugs ). After almost a century of this field's existence, the animals have multiplied, the forests are thick and the temperature inside the zone had fallen a few degrees. Unpredictable storms often hit the area, and earthquakes are much more common, even in the coastal areas unaffected by the EMP blast. The Tiamat entity also seems to attract tides, so the sea levels have risen in the coastal areas, and the surviving cities suffer greatly, and are often flooded, so they are slowly faltering.\nThe Tiamat field has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the environment and the people living within and around it. Here are some elements to consider based on the changes you've described:\n\nFlora: As nature reclaims the areas within the Tiamat field, forests and vegetation become denser, and previously cultivated land returns to its wild state. This could lead to the emergence of new plant species or the resurgence of native plants that had been previously displaced by human activity.\n\nFauna: The absence of humans and the proliferation of plant life would lead to an increase in animal populations within the Tiamat field. This might result in the resurgence of previously endangered species and the emergence of new or mutated species adapted to the altered environment. There could also be an increase in predator populations due to the abundance of prey.\n\nHuman settlements: The communities living within the Tiamat field would be forced to adapt to a pre-electric lifestyle, relying on traditional farming techniques, animal labor, and manual craftsmanship. They would need to develop new ways to defend themselves against attacks from technologically advanced polities and raiders, perhaps using ingenious low-tech solutions, traps, or guerrilla tactics.\n\nWeather patterns and natural disasters: The unpredictable storms, increased frequency of earthquakes, and altered tides caused by the Tiamat field would pose significant challenges for the people living in and around the affected areas. These communities might develop unique architectural solutions, such as stilt houses, floating structures, or buildings designed to withstand earthquakes and floods. They might also rely on traditional methods of predicting weather patterns and coping with natural disasters.\n\nSea level rise and coastal cities: As the Tiamat entity causes tides to rise and coastal areas to flood, the surviving cities would face increasing challenges to their infrastructure and resources. They might invest in building sea walls, levees, and other flood mitigation measures, or they might resort to relocating further inland as the situation becomes untenable. These cities would also need to adapt to a world with limited resources and unstable trade networks, making them more self-reliant and resourceful.\n\nConsidering these factors will help you develop a rich, detailed world that reflects the long-term effects of the Tiamat field on the environment and its inhabitants."}]}

Hendra virus (1994): Fruit bats (Pteropus species) were identified as the natural reservoir host for Hendra virus, which can cause severe respiratory and neurological disease in horses and humans. The virus was first identified in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane, Australia, in 1994, where it caused a fatal outbreak in horses and their trainers. Since then, there have been sporadic outbreaks in horses in Australia, with occasional spillover to humans. The virus has also been found in other bat species.\n2. Nipah virus (1998): Fruit bats (Pteropus species) were also identified as the natural reservoir host for Nipah virus, which can cause severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans and animals. The virus was first identified during an outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, where it caused an epidemic of encephalitis in pigs and humans. The virus has since been identified in bats and other animals in Asia.\n3. Ebola virus (1976): Fruit bats (mainly species of the genus Rousettus) are believed to be the natural reservoir host for Ebola virus, which can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates. The virus was first identified during simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. While the exact role of fruit bats in transmitting the virus to humans is not fully understood, they are believed to play a key role in the virus's ecology.\n4. Marburg virus (1967): Fruit bats (species of the genus Rousettus) are also believed to be the natural reservoir host for Marburg virus, which can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates. The virus was first identified during an outbreak in Marburg, Germany, in 1967, where it caused a cluster of severe cases in laboratory workers who had been exposed to African green monkeys imported from Uganda. Since then, sporadic outbreaks of Marburg virus have occurred in Africa, with occasional spillover to humans.\n5. Hantavirus (1993): Several species of rodents have been identified as the natural reservoir host for hantavirus, which can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans. The virus was first identified in the southwestern United States in 1993, during an outbreak of HPS among Native Americans. The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) was identified as the primary rodent host for the virus in that region, although other rodent species can also carry the virus.\n\nIn general, the number of animals found infected with the virus can vary widely depending on the virus and the host species. In some cases, only a small number of animals may be found to be carrying the virus, while in other cases the virus may be more widespread in the host population."}]}

With a history that spans more than 30 years, the editor\u2019s impact on the industry is undeniable. Many editors and IDEs have gone as far as creating their own Vim plugins to support this mode of editing. With IntelliJ IDEA, we use the actively supported and developed plugin, IdeaVim. The plugin has about half a million active users per year.\n\nFor many search operations, Vim uses regular expressions. While the Vim syntax for regular expressions has a lot in common with PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), it uses its own syntax, contains unique features, and integrates Vim-specific functionality.\n\nFor example, its syntax takes into account the position of the caret in the editor window, knows whether the text under the caret has been selected, and accounts for bookmarks in the text. This makes the regular expressions of Vim extremely powerful in the context of text editors and IDEs.\n\nThe goal of this project is to implement a regex engine in accordance with Vim\u2019s specifications. Before writing the engine, you'll have to research RegExp implementations and choose suitable algorithms for RegExp parsing and matching.\n\nThis is an interesting and nontrivial task with a lot of room for various optimizations. It is possible to use this project as the basis for writing a strong thesis.\n\nRequirements\nKnowledge of Kotlin. If you\u2019ve never used Kotlin before, you can use Java for the test task \u2013 but you will be required to learn and use it later.\nBasic knowledge of Vim editing. The project is not about Vim itself, so advanced commands are not necessary.\nBasic knowledge of RegExp syntax.\nDedication to Vim and test writing.\nThe following would be a plus:\nKnowledge of JVM\nBasic knowledge of how programming languages are parsed and compiled.\n\nIn the application form for the internship, i have to answer the following question:\n\n> Why are you interested in this project and how do you see its implementation?\n\nI already can say plenty on my interest and abilities regarding programming tools in general and regular expression engines, but i have not yet used vim because the learning curve has daunted me. of course, i do not want to put that into my application, but i want to say something like that im eager to master it. help to express that in a positive and convincing way"}]}

A well-defined project scope outlines the project's objectives, timelines, budget, and deliverables and helps homeowners in decision-making and prioritizing. In this section, we will explore the steps for creating a project scope.\n\nStep 1: Identify project goals and objectives. This step involves determining the purpose of the project and the expected outcomes. Homeowners should ask themselves what they hope to achieve with the project and what their primary objectives are.\n\nStep 2: Identify project constraints. This step involves identifying any limitations that may affect the project, such as budget, timeline, or regulatory requirements.\n\nStep 3: Identify must-haves vs. nice-to-haves. Homeowners should differentiate between the essential features that the project needs to have versus the features that are desirable but not necessary.\n\nStep 4: Prioritize features. Homeowners should prioritize features based on their needs and objectives. They should allocate resources accordingly and focus on the critical aspects of the project.\n\nStep 5: Identify key stakeholders. This step involves identifying the individuals or groups that will be affected by the project and communicating with them throughout the project.\n\nSome key considerations and elements to include in a project scope are the project timeline, budget, required resources, key deliverables, and communication plan. Homeowners should also consider any regulatory requirements or permits that may be necessary for the project.\n\nWhen it comes to prioritizing features, homeowners should focus on their must-haves and allocate resources accordingly. If there is room in the budget or timeline for nice-to-haves, homeowners can consider adding them later in the project.\n\nHere are some examples of well-defined project scopes:\n\n* Jane wanted to renovate her bathroom. Her project scope included replacing the bathtub, installing new tile flooring, and adding new lighting fixtures. She prioritized these features based on her needs and budget.\n* Tom wanted to add a home office to his house. His project scope included a timeline for completion, budget, required resources, key deliverables, and communication plan. He also identified key stakeholders, including his family, who would be affected by the project.\n\nIn summary, creating a project scope is a critical step in any renovation or construction project. Homeowners should identify project goals, constraints, and stakeholders, prioritize features, and allocate resources accordingly. By following these steps, homeowners can ensure that their project runs smoothly, on time, and within budget."}]}

Grants commonly overlooked\nSome government grants are competitive, and some grant opportunities do not use all their budget.\nHowever, in my experience, many organizations rarely look outside the government for grants.\nTwo common organizations that give grants are Rotary and Corporations.\nRotary\nIf you are near a Rotary Club (hint you are), you need to start building a relationship with them. Rotary Clubs are looking for great collaborators.\nCorporations\nBusinesses have several reasons for partnering with non-profit organizations. In some cases, it might be highly strategic. A non-profit organization can be a conduit to helping them build trust where they do business. A food bank or other popular non- profit organization are great examples. Focus on the relationship. Understand the corporation's actual need (it might be government or citizen trust). Demonstrate how you can help the company. In this way, everyone is working together to make the planet a better place.\nGrant story\nEntrepreneurs should be aware that large corporations issue calls to solve specific problems. Many have \"calls\" for innovative technology to solve particular problems or contribute to a grant fund with other businesses. An example of this grant is the Natural Gas Innovation Fund in Canada, which is funded by industry.\n10. Grants for your kids\nThe Canadian federal government has many grant programs for school-aged children.

{"timestamp": 18417, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 457, "Output Length": 50, "prompt": "The choice of database technology for a given domain model depends on a variety of factors, including the size and complexity of the data, the performance requirements of the application, the scalability and availability requirements of the system, and the development team's familiarity with different database technologies. That being said, here are some database technologies that could be well-suited to hold the data in the domain model for a delivery marketplace application:\n\n1. Relational databases: Relational databases are a common choice for many applications, and can be a good fit for domain models with well-defined relationships between entities. Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle could be used to store the delivery, order, courier, and other entities in the domain model. Additionally, relational databases support advanced query capabilities and can handle complex transactional scenarios, making them well-suited to applications that require strong data consistency.\n2. Document databases: Document databases are a type of NoSQL database that store data in flexible, JSON-like documents rather than rigidly structured tables. Document databases like MongoDB or Couchbase could be used to store entities in the domain model, particularly those with more flexible or nested data structures, such as delivery or order details. Document databases are often used in applications that require high scalability and performance, as they can handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally across multiple nodes.\n3. Graph databases: Graph databases are designed to store and query complex networks of relationships between entities, making them a good fit for domain models with complex inter-entity relationships. Graph databases like Neo4j or Amazon Neptune could be used to store entities in the domain model that have complex relationships, such as courier availability, delivery routes, or order fulfillment patterns.\n4. Time-series databases: Time-series databases are optimized for storing and querying large volumes of time-stamped data, making them well-suited to applications that require temporal analysis or trend monitoring. Time-series databases like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB could be used to store entities in the domain model that have temporal data associated with them, such as delivery status updates or courier activity logs.\n\nUltimately, the choice of database technology will depend on the specific needs and constraints of the application, and may involve a trade-off between factors such as data consistency, scalability, performance, and ease of development."}]}

Keep it short.\n\nScript:\nYou already covered UX principles that you can apply to the little Lemon website as you improve its ordering and reservation functionalities. But you know that you also need to improve the user interface. So you're excited to find out more about UI design. In this video, you will learn to: explain the concepts of the UI component of UX UI, identify applications of UI and recognize the importance of successful UI design. To interface with something means interacting or communicating with it. You can interface with other humans and you can interface with computers and applications. People do it every day to communicate with colleagues and friends by email and text messages or with technology, for example, a printer by changing its settings and interfacing with a barista while they interact with a machine to make a coffee. Think about how you use your devices to achieve any number of tasks, like getting directions to places, taking online classes, or ordering food. A graphical user interface or GUI presents interactive visual components people can interact with on-screen to communicate with technology. For consistency, we refer to it as a UI. The information and how it is laid out, the icons, colors, text, shapes, and information that is all the UI. What happens when you tap or click something? That's the UI too. Interfaces are about communication and since the dawn of time, humans have used tools as a means to communicate with each other. Cave drawings show us that people used sticks to illustrate stories and events. The stick became the quill and the quill became the pen, which is still something used every day to convey messages and to communicate intent to others. Think of the modern keyboard, which is derived from the typewriter. Humans interacted with a typewriter by hitting keys with their fingers to assemble words. You do the same thing today when you are posting a status update on your favorite social network. Interfaces are also about tasks. Think about a car. The dashboard is a perfect example of a user interface. If the driver performs a task like pressing the gas pedal, the car responds and the speedometer reacts on the dashboard and you also go faster. When you interact with your phone to check the Wi-Fi signal and the battery level, that is communication. The importance of a well-designed user interface cannot be overestimated. Think of the interface on a medical device that can communicate vitals to a doctor or the controls of an airplane that can keep passengers safe in a storm. The intuitiveness of their designs can help save lives. Xerox PARC was the first PC with a graphical user interface. This UI was refined over the years and the Xerox Star was launched in 1981 as a personal computer. The introduction and widespread application of many design metaphors such as the desktop, Windows, menus, and icons were and are still in use today. These design metaphors helped users complete tasks by associating familiar mental models with this then-new unfamiliar space. Another milestone was the introduction of smartphones and tablets, which utilize multi-touch screens, facilitating the use of gestures to interact with them. Developers and designers were able to innovate and create applications to run on these devices. This phase, in particular, has brought on the current state of UI. It is ubiquitous. You can see it everywhere from the absolute use to modern electric vehicle dashboards. In this course, you will focus on UI apply to the design of a website. However, the methods and concepts can apply to a range of outputs like applications. In this video, you learned about user interface design, its history and evolution, and the importance its role plays around those daily. Keeping the history and concepts in mind can help you create a better UI design for the little Lemon website."}]}

Use a UNC path: Instead of using a mapped drive letter to access the remote file server share, use a UNC path. This can sometimes result in better performance, as mapped drives can be slower due to network latency.\n2. Use a search pattern: Use a search pattern to filter the files you want to retrieve. This can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network, resulting in faster performance. For example, if you know that you only want to retrieve Excel files with the \".xlsx\" extension, you could use a search pattern like `\"*.xlsx\"` instead of `\"*\"`.\n3. Use the EnumerateFiles method: Instead of using the `GetFiles` method, which retrieves an array of all matching file paths, use the `EnumerateFiles` method, which returns an enumerable collection of file paths. This can improve performance by allowing you to process files one at a time instead of all at once. For example:\n```csharp\nvar files = Directory.EnumerateFiles(@\"\\\\fileserver\\excelfiles\", \"*.xlsx\", SearchOption.AllDirectories);\nforeach (var file in files)\n{\n    // process file\n}\n```\n4. Use a background thread: If you're searching for a large number of files, consider using a background thread to perform the search. This can improve the responsiveness of your application by allowing the user to continue interacting with the UI while the search is being performed.\n5. Use caching: If you frequently search for the same files, consider caching the results to avoid the overhead of repeatedly searching the file system. You could cache the results in memory, or use a caching mechanism like Redis or Memcached."}]}

Light enters from air to glass having refractive index 1.5. What is the speed of light in the glass if the speed of light in air is 3 x 10^8 m/s?\na) 2 x 10^8 m/s\nb) 1.5 x 10^8 m/s\nc) 2 x 10^6 m/s\nd) 1.33 x 10^8 m/s\n\nAns: d) 1.33 x 10^8 m/s\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen light travels from one medium to another, its speed changes according to the refractive index of the medium. The speed of light in vacuum or air is considered to be constant and is denoted by the letter c. In this question, we need to find the speed of light in glass, which is a medium with a refractive index of 1.5.\n\nThe formula for calculating the speed of light in a medium is:\n\nv = c/n\n\nWhere v is the speed of light in the medium, c is the speed of light in vacuum or air, and n is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nv = (3 x 10^8)/1.5\n\nv = 2 x 10^8 m/s\n\nSo the correct answer is d) 1.33 x 10^8 m/s\n\nConcept building question:\n\nQ. What is the refractive index of a medium?\n\nAns: The refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum or air to the speed of light in the medium. It is denoted by the letter n and is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nFormula: n = c/v\n\nWhere c is the speed of light in vacuum or air and v is the speed of light in the medium.\n\nNumerical question:\n\nQ. A ray of light passes from air to glass having refractive index 1.5. If the angle of incidence is 30 degrees, what is the angle of refraction? (Assume the speed of light in air to be 3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nAns: The first step is to use Snell's law to find the angle of refraction:\n\nn1sin\u03b81 = n2sin\u03b82\n\nWhere n1 is the refractive index of the first medium, \u03b81 is the angle of incidence, n2 is the refractive index of the second medium, and \u03b82 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, n1 is 1 (since the first medium is air), n2 is 1.5, and \u03b81 is 30 degrees. We need to find \u03b82.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n1 x sin30 = 1.5 x sin\u03b82\n\nsin\u03b82 = (1/1.5) x sin30\n\nsin\u03b82 = 0.3333\n\n\u03b82 = sin^-1(0.3333)\n\n\u03b82 = 19.47 degrees\n\nSo the angle of refraction is 19.47 degrees."}]}

My fascination with the universe began at a young age, and as I grew older, I found myself drawn to the language of science. As physicist Albert Einstein once said, \"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science.\"\n\nOne of the things that has always captivated me about Astroparticle Physics is its ability to use the tiniest particles to unveil the biggest mysteries of the universe. It is as if we are deciphering the secrets of the cosmos bit by bit, like a code that has yet to be cracked. The words of physicist Stephen Hawking echo in my mind: \"Science is not only a disciple of reason, but, also, one of romance and passion.\"\n\nDuring my undergraduate studies in Physics, I had the opportunity to work on a research project investigating the properties of dark matter. This experience allowed me to appreciate the profound impact that astroparticle physics research can have on our understanding of the universe. As physicist Richard Feynman once said, \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.\"\n\nMy passion for Astroparticle Physics only intensified during my Master's program, where I worked on the search for high-energy cosmic neutrinos using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. This experience cemented my belief in the power of science to reveal the hidden secrets of the universe. As astrophysicist Janna Levin once said, \"Science is an expression of human curiosity. It arises from our desire to know.\"\n\nI am confident that pursuing a Ph.D. in Astroparticle Physics will allow me to continue exploring the unknown and to contribute to our understanding of the universe. As physicist Richard Dawkins once said, \"Science, the product of human curiosity, is the most reliable way of understanding the natural world.\" I am passionate about using science to make meaningful contributions to society and to inspire others to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, I am excited about the possibility of joining your community of scholars and making meaningful contributions to the field of Astroparticle Physics. As physicist Niels Bohr once said, \"Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.\" I am eager to embark on this journey of exploration and discovery, to learn from the best minds in the field, and to push the boundaries of what we know about the universe.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"}]}

Termination Clause (Low Importance, High Likelihood)\nThe contract should include a termination clause that allows the HOA to terminate the agreement for cause, such as the contractor's failure to perform the work according to the agreed-upon schedule or specifications.\n8. Project Timeline (Low Importance, High Likelihood)\nThe contract should include a clear project timeline, with milestones and an estimated completion date. This will help the HOA manage expectations and hold the contractor accountable for meeting deadlines.\n9. Lien Waiver (Low Importance, High Likelihood)\nThe HOA should request that the contractor provide a lien waiver upon completion of the project and receipt of payment, to protect the HOA from any future claims by subcontractors or suppliers.\n\nThese suggested changes are aimed at protecting the HOA's interests while maintaining a fair and mutually beneficial relationship with the contractor. While some suggestions may have a lower likelihood of being accepted by the contractor, it's essential for the HOA to prioritize and negotiate the most crucial terms to ensure a successful project outcome."}]}

However, Sourcery doesn't have built-in templates for generating Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation, so you would need to create custom templates for that purpose.\n\nHere's an example of how you could create a custom Sourcery template for generating the Vapor routes along with the OpenAPI documentation:\n\n1. Install Sourcery: You can install Sourcery using Homebrew or by downloading the latest release from GitHub. For more information on installation, visit: <https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery#installation>\n2. Create a custom template: Create a new file named `VaporRoutes.stencil` with the following content:\n```stencil\nimport Vapor\nimport VaporOpenAPI\n\n{% for type in types.implementing.VaporController %}\nextension {{ type.name }} {\n\n    {% for method in type.methods %}\n    {% if method.annotations.route %}\n    struct APIRouteMetadata {\n        static let {{ method.shortName }} = APIRoute(\n            summary: \"{{ method.annotations.summary }}\",\n            description: \"{{ method.annotations.description }}\",\n            tags: [\"{{ method.annotations.tag }}\"],\n            responses: [\n                APIResponse(\n                    status: .ok,\n                    description: \"{{ method.annotations.responseDescription }}\",\n                    content: [\n                        .json: APIResponseContent(type: {{ method.annotations.responseType }}.self)\n                    ]\n                )\n            ]\n        )\n    }\n    {% endif %}\n    {% endfor %}\n\n    func setupRouter(_ app: Application) {\n        {% for method in type.methods %}\n        {% if method.annotations.route %}\n        let {{ method.shortName }}Route = app.routes.grouped(\"{{ method.annotations.path }}\")\n        {{ method.shortName }}Route.{{ method.annotations.method }}(use: {{ method.shortName }}Handler).api(APIRouteMetadata.{{ method.shortName }})\n        {% endif %}\n        {% endfor %}\n    }\n}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n1. Annotate your `DistributorController` with the required metadata for generating the routes:\n```swift\n// sourcery: VaporController\nstruct DistributorController {\n\n    // ...\n\n    // sourcery: route=path:\"distributors\", method:\"get\", summary:\"List all distributors\", description:\"Fetch a list of all distributors for a venue.\", tag:\"Distributor\", responseDescription:\"A list of distributors.\", responseType:\"[DistributorAPI]\"\n    func listHandler(_ request: Request) async throws -> Response {\n        let distributors = try await self.service.list(venueId: request.venueIdValue).map { $0.toDict }\n        return Response.with(response: .list(value: distributors), using: request)\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Run Sourcery to generate the code:\n```sh\nsourcery --sources Sources --templates VaporRoutes.stencil --output Generated\n```\nThis command will generate the code for your Vapor routes with OpenAPI documentation in the `Generated` folder.\n\n1. Add the generated file to your Xcode project and use the `setupRouter(_:)` method in the `configure.swift` file to configure your application's routes.\n\nPlease note that this example only covers a simple case with a single route. You might need to adjust the template and your annotations to cover more complex scenarios, like handling different HTTP methods, path parameters, query parameters, and multiple response types."}]}

Wilkins proposed a classification system for words based on their semantic features. He identified a series of categories, including substance, quantity, quality, relation, and action. For example, the word \"apple\" would be classified under the category of substance, while the word \"red\" would be classified under the category of quality.\n2. Wilkins also proposed a system of symbols or characters that would represent these categories of words. Each symbol or character would be composed of simpler elements that represented the features of the word being represented. For example, the symbol for the category of substance would be composed of a symbol for matter and a symbol for form.\n3. Wilkins also proposed a system of roots and affixes that would allow new words to be created based on the existing categories. For example, by combining the root for \"apple\" with an affix that indicated size, a new word could be created to represent a small apple.\n4. Wilkins also proposed a system of synonyms and homonyms that would allow for greater precision in communication. Synonyms would be words that represented the same concept or object, while homonyms would be words that sounded the same but represented different concepts or objects. For example, the word \"bass\" could be a synonym for \"fish,\" while the word \"bass\" could also refer to a low-pitched musical note.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how Wilkins proposed a systematic approach to the study of word meanings, including the classification of words based on their semantic features, the use of symbols and affixes to create new words, and the importance of precision in communication through the use of synonyms and homonyms."}]}
{"timestamp": 19018, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 767, "Output Length": 43, "prompt": "Control Tower Organization and Governance\n\nIn order for a control tower to function effectively, it requires a clear organizational structure and governance framework. This section will cover the key elements of control tower organization and governance, including organizational structures and roles, key performance indicators (KPIs), and governance models and best practices.\n\nOrganizational Structures and Roles\n\nThe organizational structure of a control tower typically includes a team of experts responsible for various functions. These functions may include planning, forecasting, execution, monitoring, and optimization. Each team member plays a critical role in ensuring that the control tower operates smoothly and efficiently.\n\nThe control tower team is typically led by a manager who is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the control tower. This manager may report to a senior executive within the organization or to a dedicated governance board. In addition to the manager, the team may include:\n\n* Planners: Responsible for developing forecasts and creating plans for the operation of the supply chain.\n* Execution Experts: Responsible for executing plans and ensuring that everything is on track.\n* Monitors: Responsible for monitoring the performance of the supply chain and identifying potential issues.\n* Optimization Experts: Responsible for identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes to optimize the supply chain.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nKPIs are critical to the success of a control tower. They provide a way to measure performance and identify areas for improvement. Some of the most common KPIs for control towers include:\n\n* On-time delivery: This measures the percentage of orders that are delivered on time.\n* Order accuracy: This measures the percentage of orders that are filled correctly.\n* Inventory accuracy: This measures the accuracy of inventory levels.\n* Lead time: This measures the time it takes to fulfill an order.\n* Cost savings: This measures the amount of cost savings achieved through the operation of the control tower.\n\nGovernance Models and Best Practices\n\nEffective governance is critical to the success of a control tower. A governance model provides a framework for decision-making, accountability, and oversight. There are several governance models that may be used for a control tower, including:\n\n* Centralized Governance: This model involves a centralized team responsible for overseeing the entire supply chain. The team may have representatives from different parts of the organization, but the decision-making authority rests with the centralized team.\n* Decentralized Governance: This model involves a network of teams responsible for different parts of the supply chain. Each team is responsible for making decisions related to their part of the supply chain, but there is coordination and oversight from a central team.\n* Hybrid Governance: This model combines elements of both centralized and decentralized governance. There may be a centralized team responsible for overseeing the entire supply chain, but there may also be decentralized teams responsible for specific areas.\n\nIn addition to choosing a governance model, there are several best practices that can be used to ensure effective governance of a control tower. These include:\n\n* Clearly defined roles and responsibilities: Everyone involved in the control tower should understand their roles and responsibilities, as well as those of other team members.\n* Regular communication: Communication is critical to the success of a control tower. Team members should communicate regularly to ensure that everyone is on the same page.\n* Continuous improvement: The control tower should be continuously reviewed and improved to ensure that it is meeting the needs of the organization.\n* Data-driven decision-making: Decisions should be based on data and analytics, rather than on intuition or guesswork.\n* Standardization: Standardization of processes and procedures can help ensure consistency and efficiency across the supply chain.\n\nConclusion\n\nEffective control tower organization and governance is critical to the success of any supply chain operation. A well-structured control tower team, clear KPIs, and effective governance models and best practices can help ensure that the supply chain operates smoothly and efficiently. By following these best practices"}]}
{"timestamp": 19108, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 773, "Output Length": 19, "prompt": "Sure, here are some example questions on math and how to respond to them:\n\n1. What is the difference between variance and standard deviation?\n* Variance measures the spread of a dataset by calculating the average of the squared differences from the mean, while standard deviation is the square root of variance and represents the average distance of each data point from the mean.\n* Example: In a dataset of test scores where the mean is 80, the variance might be 100, indicating that the scores are spread out over a wider range. The standard deviation would then be 10, indicating that the average score is 10 points away from the mean.\n1. Can you explain what a derivative is?\n* A derivative is a measure of how much a function changes with respect to its input. It is calculated as the slope of a tangent line at a specific point on the function.\n* Example: For the function f(x) = x^2, the derivative at x = 3 would be 6, since the slope of the tangent line at that point is 6.\n1. How do you calculate the area under a curve?\n* The area under a curve can be calculated using integration, which involves finding the anti-derivative of the function and evaluating it at specific intervals.\n* Example: The area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2 can be calculated using integration as \u222b(0,2) x^2 dx = [x^3/3] from 0 to 2, which evaluates to (2^3/3) - (0^3/3) = 8/3.\n1. What is linear algebra?\n* Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations, vectors, matrices, and transformations.\n* Example: Solving a system of linear equations can be done using matrix algebra, where the coefficients of the variables are arranged in a matrix and the solutions are represented as a vector.\n1. What is the difference between a scalar and a vector?\n* A scalar is a single value that represents a quantity, while a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.\n* Example: The temperature outside is a scalar value, while the velocity of an object is a vector value since it has both speed and direction.\n1. Can you explain the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors?\n* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important in linear algebra and represent special values and vectors that remain unchanged when a linear transformation is applied.\n* Example: When a matrix is multiplied by its eigenvector, the resulting vector is a scalar multiple of the original eigenvector with the scalar value as the eigenvalue.\n1. How do you calculate a matrix determinant?\n* The determinant of a square matrix can be calculated using various methods, including the Leibniz formula, the Laplace expansion, or by reducing the matrix to row-echelon form and multiplying the diagonal elements.\n* Example: The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] can be calculated as ad - bc.\n1. What is the formula for Bayes' theorem?\n* Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.\n* Example: The formula for Bayes' theorem is P(A|B) = P(B|A) \\* P(A) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that event B has occurred.\n1. Can you explain the concept of optimization?\n* Optimization involves finding the best possible solution to a problem or objective, often by maximizing or minimizing a specific metric or objective function.\n* Example: In machine learning, optimization is often used to"}]}

Define your access control policy in OPA. This policy should define the rights and their constraints for each user. Here's an example of how you can define the policy:\n```python\npackage example\n\nimport data.users\nimport data.rights\n\n# Define the constraints for the CreatePurchaseOrder right\ncreate_purchase_order_constraints = {\n    \"country\": [\"US\", \"CA\", \"MX\"]\n}\n\n# Define the allow rule that checks whether a user has the CreatePurchaseOrder right and returns the constraints\nallow {\n    input.right = \"CreatePurchaseOrder\"\n    user_has_right(input.user_id, input.right)\n    get_constraints(input.right, input.user_id) == create_purchase_order_constraints\n}\n\n# Define the user_has_right rule that checks whether a user has the specified right\nuser_has_right(user_id, right) {\n    user := users[user_id]\n    right_id := rights[right]\n    right_id in user.rights\n}\n\n# Define the get_constraints rule that retrieves the constraints for the specified right and user\nget_constraints(right, user_id) = constraints {\n    user := users[user_id]\n    constraints := user.right_constraints[right]\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `create_purchase_order_constraints` variable defines the constraints for the `CreatePurchaseOrder` right, which specify the countries where the user is allowed to create a purchase order. The `allow` rule checks whether the user has the `CreatePurchaseOrder` right and returns the constraints if they do. The `user_has_right` rule checks whether the user has the specified right. The `get_constraints` rule retrieves the constraints for the specified right and user.\n\n2. Implement an API in your application that sends a partial query to the OPA server and retrieves the constraints for the `CreatePurchaseOrder` right for the user.

I will give you further instructions after this.\nConstruction & Building Lawyers in Melbourne\nWe are expert building and construction lawyers who provide practical legal advice and representation to:\n\nProperty Owners (including home owners)\nBuilders\nContactors / Sub-Contractors\nProperty developers\nEngineers\nArchitects\nSurveyors\nTradespeople\nBuilding and construction lawyers\nOur Building Legal Services\nCOMMERCIAL BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION\nRESIDENTIAL BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION\nOWNERS CORPORATION\nOur construction and building lawyers in Melbourne have expertise in a wide range of matters relating to the building industry, helping land owners, builders, project managers, and others to avoid running into legal difficulties \u2013 or otherwise resolve them.\n\nWe have practical experience in and around the building industry, which means that our building lawyers understand both the practical side of building issues, in addition, of course, to the legal issues.\n\nNew Building Contracts - Drafting the Contract\nAs a builder or contractor, you may require expert input from a construction lawyer into the legal terms of a domestic or commercial building contract. We can draft the contract for you from the beginning or otherwise adapt an existing contract to cater for a particular job.\n\nContract Review and Negotiation\nDomestic Building Contracts are, even in the standard form, complex documents, whether the contract is for a new home or a renovation. Our building lawyers in Melbourne have advised many clients about their rights and responsibilities under their building contract. There are many \u201ctricky\u201d\u201d parts in these contracts that can cost you a lot of money and time later if not thought through and addressed upfront. In other words, many problems are preventable. We can take you through the terms of your building contract before you sign it \u2013 and help you think through the issues and the legal consequences of agreeing to certain things. If amendments are required, we can also assist you in negotiating special conditions to the contract, to suit your particular circumstances.\n\nContract Termination\nOur building and construction lawyers can assist you in the following circumstances:\n\nWhen you are considering terminating a building contract\nWhen you are being threatened with building contract termination\nWhen you are in a situation where the contract has already been terminated.\nEnding the contract is a serious matter. It should not be done without seeking proper legal advice first.\n\nGenerally, a carefully drafted notice will need to be served before you terminate, so that the other party has an opportunity to fix the problems.\n\nIf the matters are not resolved, and provided there are sufficient grounds \u2013 which must also be thought through carefully \u2013 the contract can then usually be terminated.\n\nTermination by a builder or property owner can be a helpful resolution to a difficult and costly dispute when appropriate. If you terminate incorrectly, this can lead to a very expensive and protracted further dispute. You want to avoid any such dispute where possible.\n\nIf you require advice in relation to such matters, we recommend that you contact a building lawyer promptly before taking further action yourself.\n\nContractual Disputes, Litigation and Dispute Resolution\nWhile disputes are usually unpleasant and time consuming, we assist clients to:\n\nAssert and enforce contractual rights; and\nWhere necessary, assist to contain the damage and present our client\u2019s position in the best possible light.\nContractual disputes can often be resolved sensibly without the need for legal proceedings or mediation. Where possible, our building dispute lawyers will assist clients with that negotiation. If the matter needs to be litigated, we have experience representing clients in all Victorian courts and VCAT.\n\nOur building lawyers in Melbourne take a proactive approach to dispute resolution and prepare thoroughly for mediation and court proceedings.\n\nIf you have a dispute and require legal advice from building dispute lawyers, we recommend that you contact us as soon as possible to seek advice about how best to address the issues and move towards resolving the matter.\n\nWorkplace Health and Safety\nThere is a significant obligation on building companies to address health & safety matters.\n\nOur Melbourne-based construction lawyers provide advice in this complex area, including in relation to code of practice compliance and regulator investigations prosecution issues.\n\nTerms of Trade and Credit Arrangements\nWhether you\u2019re a builder or contractor, and whether you\u2019re providing the service or are the recipient of the service, it is important that you ensure that the terms of trade are helpful to you, and not a potential hindrance.\n\nOur construction lawyers in Melbourne are experienced in both drafting and reviewing terms of trade, including terms that include payment terms and credit arrangements. Getting this right upfront can save confusion and cost and later \u2013 and prevents a dispute later.\n\nIf you are already in dispute and need advice, we can also assist in representing you to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible.\n\nSecurity of Payment Act Claims\nThe point behind the Security of Payments Act legislation is that a party who undertakes construction work is entitled to recover progress payments in relation to the work carried out.\n\nThis is a complex area. When used appropriately, it can be a powerful tool for getting paid, but careful consideration is required as to whether it is the best approach in the circumstances.\n\nA building and construction lawyer can assist you with:\n\nMaking a claim\nApplying for Adjudication\nDefending a claim, including adjudication responses\nApplying to set aside an adjudication determination\nEnforcing an adjudication determination or judgment\nThere are also other methods of debt recovery, and we have experience acting for both plaintiffs and defendants in such circumstances.\n\nBusiness Set Up\nWe regularly provide advice for setting up a new business, including business structures.\n\nWhether you choose to operate as a sole trader company or select a company trust structure can affect your ongoing liability and have taxation consequences.\n\nNeeds also change over time. What might have been suitable when you start business may need to be reviewed as your business grows and changes.\n\nGood legal advice from a construction lawyer will assist you to think through the issues so you can get your building and construction business structure right.\n\nBuying and Selling Real Estate\nAs a builder or developer, if you are involved in buying and selling development sites, you will need to have solid legal advice from a construction lawyer in Melbourne.\n\nWe have property lawyers who can assist in contracts for the sale and purchase of land and, where relevant, commercial and residential leases.\n\nBuilder, Contractor and Sub-contractor Agreements and Disputes\nThe relationship between a contractor and sub-contractor is somewhat unique. It is business to business and you are both in the building industry. Disputes are common and the party who understands its legal position will have the advantage.\n\nOur building dispute lawyers can advise in relation to the following contractor-specific matters:\n\nEmployment advice \u2013 A building lawyer can help determine if the contractor is truly a contractor or an employee and assist with disputes where they arise.\n\nContracts between builders, contractors and subcontractors \u2013 Our construction lawyers in Melbourne can draft and review such contracts and provide advice in the event of a dispute. Where the matter cannot be resolved amicably, our building litigators will represent you very competently.\n\nDisputes between builders, contractors and subcontractors \u2013 If there is a dispute, small disagreements can become expensive disputes quickly. It is sensible to work out the legal issues quickly and try to resolve the dispute. If the other party is not being sensible, a swift and firm approach is usually helpful.\n\nIf you need advice in relation to matters between builders, contractors and sub-contractors, our team of building dispute lawyers can assist you with a high degree of competence.\n\nLicences and Permits\nOur building lawyers in Melbourne can provide advice in relation to the following:\n\nBuilding plumbing, electrical and gas fitting licences \u2013 including application, suspension and appeal\nDevelopment applications\nWater usage\nSewerage/drainage matters\nTree protection (including dealing with planning permit conditions and overlays)\nFire management and fire safety\nExplosives\nAsbestos removal\nPublic land use\nOur building and construction lawyers can assist in the preparation of documentation and representation in relation to all of the above.\n\nBuilding Defects and Home Warranty Insurance Claims\nNot all builders are good builders.\n\nHome warranty claims can be made against builders for defective work.\n\nThe insurance policy cannot be claimed against unless the builder is insolvent, cannot be found or is dead. So, the circumstances are limited.\n\nOur building lawyers have strong experience in helping land owners who have engaged builders and the work is substandard. There are useful remedies available to help get your defects fixed and/or to get you an appropriate amount of compensation.\n\nWe have access to outstanding building experts who can identify the defects (sometimes well beyond what is already known) and ascribe a value to fixing those defects to assist us in properly articulating your claim.\n\nWe will always endeavour to get the dispute resolved without litigation but, if necessary, our building dispute lawyers will prosecute your case with vigour against the builder in VCAT or the courts.\n\nIf you are in dispute with your builder and need legal advice as to how to negotiate with them, or if you would like us to negotiate for you, please contact us.\n\nDebt Recovery\nDebt recovery in building matters is not always clear cut. There can be offsets and counterclaims, so thoughtful consideration of the approach is advantageous.\n\nOur debt recovery team is very experienced and typically successful at recovering outstanding payments.\n\nWe regularly issue letters of demand and commence proceedings to enforce the payment of outstanding debts.\n\nWe will also recommend the Security of Payment approach where appropriate.\n\nWe also defend claim for payment for clients to whom alleged monies are owed.\n\nProject Finance & Finance Documentation Advice\nWe can provide clients with a sound explanation of all finance contracts and personal guarantees in relation to such matters as:\n\nLender contracts from bank and financiers relating to the mortgage of land\nProject funding\nEquipment finance\nThese appointments are usually short and concise. Our building and construction lawyers will ensure that the documentation is explained to you adequately and that the documents are signed correctly.\n\nCall our construction lawyers today on 1300 907 335 to discuss your situation, or simply fill in the enquiry form on this page to receive a prompt response from our construction and building lawyers in Melbourne."}]}

It provides opportunities for engineering students to overcome their current learning weaknesses and aims to close the learning gap for students to achieve course objectives (Subheesh & Sethy, 2020). Engineering students currently engage in feedback activities from receiving feedback from teachers for assessments and providing peer evaluations to other students. However, the feedback itself can be a time-consuming process for teachers and their provided feedback was often labelled as limited (Vardi, 2009). An AI-automated feedback tool can be utilized to enhance the feedback experience for engineering students. It allows real-time feedback for students and can provide feasible individual feedback to all students in a large engineering faculty (Deeva et al., 2021). Engineering students will be able to enhance their feedback literacy to understand and create dispositions from feedback to strengthen their learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). With real-time feedback generated from an AI feedback tool, engineering students will be able to engage in student-centered learning to gain a sense of direction for their learning and become self-paced with their studies (Tubino & Adachi, 2022).

The student\u2019s evaluation and judgement from feedback develop their feedback literacy. A growing interest in shifting from teacher-centered to student-centered learning is evident in higher education (Kember, 2009). It has become a necessity for feedback to be directed towards a student-centered learning process where the ability of the student to engage and utilize feedback processes is focused (Molloy et al., 2020). The student-learning process encourages students to take more responsibility for their education and to create individualized routines that promote effective learning (McCabe & O\u2019Connor,"}]}

{"timestamp": 19331, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1884, "Output Length": 22, "prompt": "This is our goals and tasks-\n# Speaker-Independent Spoken Digit Recognition (xSDR)\nOne of the successful stories of deep neural networks is the proliferation of commercial of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. This project aims to explore one application of ML-powered ASR to the problem of spoken digit recognition (SDR). Since digits are widely used as unique identifiers for bank information, social security numbers, post codes, etc, SDR systems can be an efficient alternative to fully-fledged ASR systems since the domain is more predictable than other applications of ASR. \n\nIn this project, we focus on developing a SDR system in a speaker-independent setting. That is, the speakers in the evaluation set are disjoint from the training set speakers. We do so because we expect real-world ASR systems to generalize to different speakers than those we have data for. Moreover, for many languages that are under-resourced, we have have (limited) annotated speech data from a single speaker, but we would still want the system to be deployed to work on any speaker of that language. We tackle the problem of spoken digit recognition as a sequence classification task. Concretely, the inputs are short audio clips of a specific digit (in the range 0-9), then the goal is to build deep neural network models to classify a short audio clip and predict the digit that was spoken.\n## The Speech Signal Representation - Mel Spectrograms\nHumans can recognize and differentiate different speech sounds based on the frequency characteristics of the sounds. For machine learning applications, human speech is represented using spectro-temporal features in the [Mel-scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel\\_scale) extracted from the speech sample. Mel-scale features are inspired by human speech perception and auditory processing whereby the human ear has difference sensitivity (or resolution) in differet frequency bandes. That is, the human ear can better recognize differences in in lower range frequences, while higher range frequences have a lower resolution. The Mel-scale is linear for frequencies in the range (0-1kHz), and logarithmic for frequencies above 1kHz.\n\nIn the spectro-temporal representation of speech, a speech sample can be seen as a sequence of $T$ spectral vectors as $\\mathbf{X} = (\\mathbf{x}^1, \\mathbf{x}^2, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}^T)$. Each spectral vector $\\mathbf{x}^t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ at time-step $t$ is extracted from a short speech segment (~25 milliseconds) with the assumption that the signal is time-invariant in this small time window. Here, $k$ is the number of frequency bands in the [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram) and this is a parameter of the feature extraction pipeline. The representation is based on the Fourier transform to convert the temporal signal into the frequency domain. \n\nIn automatic speech recognition (ASR) research and applications, spectral vectors are usually referred to as \"acoustic frames\". Morover, adjacent frames are extracted with some overlap between them, usually ~10 milliseconds. \n\n## Task I\n1. One problem with the spectrogram as a speech feature represetation is that different speech samples would have dfferent durations due to inherent speech variability (e.g., speech rate, speaker dialect, etc). That is, the $T$ in the $(T \\times k)$-dimensional representation would be different for each sample. Therefore, for the baseline model, we will implement a method to have a fixed-size representation for all speech samples. Write a function downsample\\_spectrogram(X, N) that takes as input a spectrogram $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times k}$ and a parameter N <= 25. The function should (1) make N equally-sized splits of S across the time-axis, (2) apply a pooling technique (e.g., mean pooling) to each split across the frequency axis to obtain an array that represents a downsampled version of the spectrogram $\\mathbf{X}' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times k}$, and (3) re-arange $\\mathbf{X}'$ as a vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{Nk}$. \n\n2. Using the downsample\\_spectrogram(X, N) function, transform all the speech samples into vectors $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{Nk}$. \n\n3. Given the speaker-based train/dev/test spilts in the SDR\\_metadata.tsv, fit a linear model on the training samples. That is, your model should be build on data from 4 speakers {'nicolas', 'theo' , 'jackson', 'george'}. Hint: you can experiment with a few model alternatives in the SGDClassifier module in scikit-learn. \n\n4. Evaluate you model on the dev and test splits. Use accuracy as an evaluation metric. Analyze the model performance using a [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion\\_matrix) of the all possible labels (0-9), Analyze [precision, recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision\\_and\\_recall), [F1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) for each label. Report your observation.\n\n## Task II\n1. Having established a baseline with a linear model trained on a downsampled signal representation of the speech segment, this task aims to learn a classifier based on the full speech segment. To this end, you will implement a neural model that is suitable for sequential data such as recurrent DNN, convolutional DNN with 1-D temporal convolution, or an audio transformer. The model should take the acoustic sample as it is (i.e., the Mel spectrogram could have an arbitrary length) without the need to downsample the segment. You need to implement at least two of the aforementioned models. Do the neural models improve accuracy over the baseline model? Do you observe any signs of overfitting to the training data? How do the hyperparameters affect the model performance? Report and discuss your observations. \n\n2. Evaluate your (best) neural models and compare to the baseline model using the same evalution process as in task I.4. \n\n3. Use a dimensionality reduction algorithm such as t-SNE \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed\\_stochastic\\_neighbor\\_embedding),[2](https://pypi.org/project/tsne-torch/),[3](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html)\\] or [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic\\_usage.html) to analyze how the different models seperate the different classes (the last non-linear layer in your model). Compare to the downsampled representation you used in the baseline and report your observations.\n\n4. Are the differences between the different models statistically significant? To answer this question, you need to implement a statistical significance test based on bootstrapping method. To read more how to estiame p-values based on bootstrapping, we recommend the materials on this paper https://aclanthology.org/D12-1091.pdf. Include the baseline model in your evaluation. \n\n## Task III (Open Ended)\n1. Consider the case where we have speech data from a single speaker (e.g., george). Train your models on this subset of the data. What do you observe? How does this affect the model performance? \n\n2. Even though a model is trained on a single speaker, we would like the model to generalizes to any speaker. To this end, one can use data augmentation techniques to artificially create more samples for each class. Some of these augmentations can be applied on the spectrogram (e.g., SpecAugment https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/04/specaugment-new-data-augmentation.html), and other can be applied on the raw waveform before creating the spectrogram such as pitch manipulation (https://github.com/facebookresearch/WavAugment). Explore the effect of one type of augmentation from each type. Report your observation and anaylze the confusion matrices.\n\n3. Data augmentation techniques create different \"views\" of each training sample in a stochastic or determinstic approach. One can leaverage speech data augmentation to create views for training a neural network in a contrastive learning setting with margin-based objective function (for more info, read http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/al-tahan21a/al-tahan21a.pdf). Implement at least one model using a contrastive loss based on different views of the training samples. Does this model improve over the model without contrastive learning? Report and discuss your observations. \n\nFor more information on the contrastive learning framework, you can refer to this paper\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9226466"}]}

They will add only a minute or two to your workout time.\nA lack of flexibility in the big muscles of the lower extremities and lack of mobility in the hip joints will cause increased pressure and load on the lumbar spine while limiting blood flow to important areas. Maintaining flexibility and mobility requires a combination of dynamic mobilization exercises and static stretching. \nMobilizations\nWhen we refer to maintaining range of motion in a joint, we use the term \u201cmobility.\u201d This is not a stretch but rather a movement where the goal is to move the joint through its maximum range of motion without compromising the low back. For our purposes, hip mobility is the most important. As we have said throughout the book, we want to maximize movement in the hips while minimizing movement in the lumbar spine. \nAside from the effects of limited hip mobility on the low back, it is also important to maintain hip mobility for the health of the hip itself. The hip joint has no direct blood supply and therefore relies on the pressure generated by movement in the joint to \u201csqueeze\u201d nutrients (synovial fluid) into the joint space. The more limited your range of motion in the hip, the less synovial fluid is \u201csqueezed\u201d in and the hip will eventually suffer and degenerate. This can ultimately lead to a hip replacement and other operations. We promote maximum hip mobility by lengthening the muscles around the hip through stretching and by performing mobilization exercises to \u201coil\u201d the hip joint.\nHip Circles\nThis movement is an important mobilization. Do this one before you exercise. \n\nStep 1: Get on your hands and knees.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Lift one knee slightly and pretend to \u201cdraw\u201d circles on the floor with your kneecap, getting maximum range of motion out of the hip joint without moving your low back. In other words, your hip joint should be performing all of the movement. Your back should not move at all. Done properly, you should feel your abdominal muscles working pretty hard to keep your back still while you do this movement.\nStep 4: Do ten circles clockwise, ten counterclockwise, and then switch sides. \nDon\u2019t arch the low back or hike your hip. Keep the low back still and in place. \nStretches \nIn my experience, people tend to rely far too much on stretching when trying to heal their backs. Stretching has its place but must be done in combination with all of the other strategies (changing habits, spinal stabilization, strengthening the core) in this book. The more balanced and stable your spine and its related muscles become, the less you should need to stretch over time.\nTo increase flexibility in muscles, stretches need to be held for a good while, between forty-five and sixty seconds according to some research. The stretch also needs to be fairly intense to facilitate muscle lengthening. The stretches in this chapter are \u201cstatic\u201d stretches. Static stretches are held in place for long periods of time. These are done to promote muscle lengthening. These are not to be confused with \u201cdynamic\u201d stretches. Dynamic stretches are stretches that are performed with movement and are best done prior to exercises. The dynamic hamstring stretch in your daily routine is one example. \nThe key muscles to maintain flexibility are the hamstrings, glutes, piriformis, and psoas. For each of the following four stretches, try to hold for forty-five to sixty seconds with an intensity of about a 6/10. When performing the stretch, make sure that everything is relaxed except your arms, which are doing the work. Also maintain a light core brace to protect your back. Perform these stretches after exercise. \nHamstring Stretch\n\nStep 1: Get a belt, towel, or strap. It should about twice the length of your leg.\nStep 2: Lie on your back. Place the strap around your foot.\nStep 3: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 4: Slowly pull one leg up until you feel a moderate stretch (about a 6/10 in intensity).\nStep 5: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure your arms and core are the only parts of your body working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 6: Repeat on the other side. \nGlute Stretch\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back. Find neutral spine. Brace core lightly.\nStep 2: Cross one leg over the other.\nStep 3: Put your hands around the thigh of the uncrossed leg and use it as a lever to pull back the crossed leg, stretching the buttock.\nStep 4: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure that your arms and core are the only areas working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 5: Repeat on other side. \nPiriformis Stretch\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core. Bend one knee and bring it toward your chest.\nStep 3: Grab the top/outside of the foot of the bent leg with the opposite hand as shown.\nStep 4: With the other hand, grab the knee.\nStep 5: Pull the knee to the opposite shoulder, creating a stretch in the buttock area. \nStep 6: Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Make sure that your arms and core are the only areas working. Everything else should be relaxed.\nStep 7: Repeat on other side. \nPsoas Stretch\nThis stretch is slightly more difficult than the others. The goal is to feel a stretch in the top of the thigh, groin, and inside the abdominal wall.\n\nStep 1: Get in a half-kneeling position: One leg will be in front of you, knee bent, and foot on the floor. The other leg will be below you, knee bent, with lower leg and knee resting on the floor. \nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Shift your body forward by \u201cpointing\u201d your hip bone straight out in front of you while simultaneously squeezing the glutes on that side. You should maintain neutral spine, not round your back or hinge forward at the hips. \nStep 4: Bring your arms up over your head. You should feel the stretch in the thigh, groin, and/or inner abdomen. Hold for forty-five to sixty seconds. Then switch sides."}]}

{"timestamp": 19777, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 767, "Output Length": 25, "prompt": "Sure, here are some more detailed explanations of how each design pattern uses OOP principles:\n\n1. Abstraction:\n* Template Method Pattern: Uses abstraction to define the overall structure of an algorithm, while allowing subclasses to define certain steps of the algorithm. This helps to avoid code duplication and provides a way to customize the behavior of the algorithm without changing its structure.\n* Strategy Pattern: Uses abstraction to encapsulate a family of related algorithms and make them interchangeable. This helps to promote code reuse and maintainability, as well as making it easy to add new algorithms without changing the code that uses them.\n* Command Pattern: Uses abstraction to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing it to be executed at a later time. This helps to decouple the object that invokes the request from the object that performs it, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n* Observer Pattern: Uses abstraction to define a one-to-many relationship between objects, where a change in one object triggers a notification to all its dependents. This helps to promote loose coupling between objects and simplifies the process of adding or removing observers.\n2. Encapsulation:\n* Adapter Pattern: Uses encapsulation to convert the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect. This helps to promote interoperability between different classes and simplifies the process of integrating new classes into an existing system.\n* Decorator Pattern: Uses encapsulation to add behavior to an object dynamically, without affecting other objects of the same class. This helps to promote code reuse and makes it easy to add or remove behavior from an object at runtime.\n* Facade Pattern: Uses encapsulation to provide a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. This helps to simplify the interface of a complex system and makes it easier for clients to use the system.\n* Proxy Pattern: Uses encapsulation to represent an object that controls access to another object. This helps to promote security, performance optimization, and simplifies the interface of a complex system.\n3. Inheritance:\n* Factory Method Pattern: Uses inheritance to create objects of a particular class without specifying the exact class to be instantiated. This helps to promote flexibility and makes it easier to add new classes without changing the code that uses them.\n* Abstract Factory Pattern: Uses inheritance to provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This helps to promote modularity, maintainability, and makes it easy to add new families of objects without changing the code that uses them.\n* Builder Pattern: Uses inheritance to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This helps to promote flexibility and makes it easier to change the representation of a complex object without changing the code that creates it.\n* Singleton Pattern: Uses inheritance to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This helps to promote simplicity, consistency, and makes it easy to control the access to a shared resource.\n4. Polymorphism:\n* Template Method Pattern: Uses polymorphism to allow subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the overall structure of the algorithm. This helps to promote code reuse and flexibility.\n* Strategy Pattern: Uses polymorphism to allow objects to vary their behavior at runtime, by encapsulating a family of related algorithms in separate classes. This helps to promote code reuse, maintainability, and makes it easy to add new behaviors without changing the code that uses them.\n* Command Pattern: Uses polymorphism to allow multiple commands to be handled uniformly, by encapsulating a request as an object that can be executed at a later time. This helps to promote flexibility and simplifies the process of adding or removing commands.\n* Iterator Pattern: Uses polymorphism to provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially, without exposing"}]}

These goals are:\n\n1. SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation\nEdmonton's water supply comes primarily from the North Saskatchewan River, and there are concerns about water quality due to industrial and agricultural activities upstream [1]. The city is committed to improving its water management and infrastructure to ensure safe and sustainable water resources for its residents. Initiatives like the Source Water Protection Plan aim to protect the river from pollution, and the city continually monitors water quality to ensure compliance with regulatory standards [2].\n2. SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy\nEdmonton has potential for renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. The city has already initiated several renewable energy projects, including solar panel installations on municipal buildings and infrastructure [3]. The city's Community Energy Transition Strategy also emphasizes the importance of diversifying energy sources and promoting the adoption of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [4].\n3. SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\nWaste management is a critical issue for Edmonton. The city has implemented the Edmonton Waste Management Centre, a facility dedicated to waste processing and recycling [5]. Edmonton has also set a target of diverting 90% of residential waste from landfills by promoting recycling, composting, and waste reduction initiatives [6]. The city's Zero Waste Framework encourages responsible consumption and production patterns among residents and businesses [7].\n4. SDG 15: Life on Land\nEdmonton's natural ecosystems, including the North Saskatchewan River Valley and ravine system, provide essential habitat for various plant and animal species. The city's commitment to protecting and enhancing these areas is outlined in The Way We Grow, which emphasizes the importance of preserving natural areas and promoting biodiversity [8]. Edmonton's Biodiversity Action Plan also identifies strategies for conserving and restoring native habitats and species [9].\n5. SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals\nCollaboration and partnerships among various stakeholders, including government, businesses, and citizens, are vital for achieving the SDGs in Edmonton. The city actively engages with organizations such as the Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board (EMRB) to coordinate regional planning and development [10]. Additionally, partnerships with non-profit organizations, such as the Edmonton Community Foundation and the North Saskatchewan Watershed Alliance, contribute to achieving shared sustainability goals [11, 12].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] North Saskatchewan Watershed Alliance.

The `traverse` function returns a Promise that resolves to an array of the results of applying the function to each element of the original array.\n```javascript\nconst Traversable = {\n  traverse: (applicative, f) => (array) =>\n    array.reduce(\n      (acc, x) => acc.flatMap((xs) => f(x).map((y) => [...xs, y])),\n      PromiseMonad.unit([])\n    ),\n};\n```\nNext, let's define a `Foldable` object that provides a `foldMap` function that takes a monoid and a function that returns a Promise, and applies the function to each element of an array using `Array.prototype.reduce()` and `PromiseMonad.flatMap()`. The `foldMap` function returns a Promise that resolves to the combined value of all the results of applying the function to each element of the original array using the monoid's `concat` function.\n```javascript\nconst Foldable = {\n  foldMap: (monoid, f) => (array) =>\n    array.reduce((acc, x) => acc.flatMap((y) => f(x).flatMap((z) => PromiseMonad.unit(monoid.concat(y, z)))), PromiseMonad.unit(monoid.empty())\n};\n```\nNow, we can combine the `PromiseMonad`, `Traversable`, and `Foldable` objects to create a powerful abstraction for working with arrays of Promises. Here's an example:\n```javascript\nconst promiseAdd = (a, b) => Promise.resolve(a + b);\n\nPromise.empty = () => Promise.resolve(0);\n\nPromise.concat = (a, b) => Promise.all([a, b]).then(([x, y]) => promiseAdd(x, y));\n\nconst PromiseMonad = {\n  unit: (value) => Promise.resolve(value),\n  flatMap: (promise, f) => promise.then(f),\n};\n\nconst Traversable = {\n  traverse: (applicative, f) => (array) =>\n    array.reduce(\n      (acc, x) => acc.flatMap((xs) => f(x).map((y) => [...xs, y])),\n      PromiseMonad.unit([])\n    ),\n};\n\nconst Foldable = {\n  foldMap: (monoid, f) => (array) =>\n    array.reduce((acc, x) => acc.flatMap((y) => f(x).flatMap((z) => PromiseMonad.unit(monoid.concat(y, z)))), PromiseMonad.unit(monoid.empty()))\n};\n\nconst promises = [Promise.resolve(1), Promise.resolve(2), Promise.resolve(3)];\n\nconst sum = (a, b) => Promise.resolve(a + b);\n\nconst product = (a, b) => Promise.resolve(a * b);\n\nTraversable.traverse(PromiseMonad, (x) => x, promises).then((result) => console.log(result)); // Output: [1, 2, 3]\n\nFoldable.foldMap({ empty: () => 1, concat: product }, (x) => x, promises).then((result) => console.log(result)); // Output: 6\n\nFoldable.foldMap({ empty: () => 0, concat: sum }, (x) => x, promises).then((result) => console.log(result)); // Output: 6\n```\nIn this example, we define"}]}

She was a blur of energy, her curly hair bouncing as she chattered away to herself in a mix of Common and Gnomish. \"Gotta make sure the flux capacitor is properly calibrated, or we'll end up in a whole other dimension,\" she muttered, tapping at a few gauges with a spanner.\n\nA small child, barely four years old, clutched at her pant leg, looking up at her with wide eyes. \"Are we gonna fall?\" the child asked, voice quivering.\n\nKayla's grin widened, and she crouched down to the child's level. \"Fall? Oh honey, we're not gonna fall. Not with me here. I'm Kayla, the best damn mechanic on this side of the Aire Sea. This ship is in tip-top shape, top of the line elven wood and all,\" she said, patting the side of the ship affectionately.\n\nThe child's eyes widened even further. \"Wow, really?\"\n\nKayla laughed. \"You betcha. Now, you wanna see how we get this baby in the air?\" Without waiting for an answer, she clambered to her feet and gestured towards the crewmembers bustling about the deck. \"C'mon, I'll introduce you to the captain. He'll show you how to work the ropes.\"\n\nThe child's face lit up with excitement, and Kayla led her over to where the captain was standing, barking orders to the crew. \"Captain, this is little...um, what's your name, sweetie?\" she asked the child.\n\n\"Emily,\" the child whispered.\n\n\"Captain, this is Emily. She's never flown before, and she's a little scared. Can we show her around?\" Kayla asked, giving the captain a winning smile.\n\nThe captain grunted noncommittally, but gestured towards the ropes leading up to the crow's nest. \"Don't get in the way. And don't touch anything you're not supposed to,\" he warned, before turning back to his duties.\n\nKayla led Emily up the ropes, pointing out various parts of the ship as they went. \"See those gas tanks? That's what keeps us afloat. They've got this special gas in 'em that's collected way down in the rifts. Hard to come by, let me tell ya. And these propellers? They're just in case we need a little extra oomph. But really, we're just riding the air currents,\" she explained.\n\nEmily looked both excited and terrified as they reached the crow's nest. \"Wow, this is high up,\" she murmured.\n\nKayla grinned. \"Yep. And look at that view! Isn't it just incredible?\" She pointed out various landmarks as they flew over them, describing them in enthusiastic detail. \"And that over there? That's the Dawn Coast. It's said that if you catch the sun just right, you'll see the whole thing light up like gold.\"\n\nEmily gasped in awe, and Kayla's grin widened. \"See? Flying's not so scary after all, is it?\"\n\nEmily shook her head, a huge smile on her face. \"No, it's not scary at all. It's amazing!\"\n\nKayla laughed, ruffling the child's hair. \"That's the spirit.

{"timestamp": 19985, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 769, "Output Length": 15, "prompt": "Sure, I can certainly help you with that. Based on chapter 11 of the original book, which discusses the relationship between stress and back pain, I can continue the text of chapter 11 of the new book. I will break down the chapter into ten sections and provide ten pages of content or twenty paragraphs for each section.\n\nSection 1: Introduction to Stress and Back Pain\nStress and back pain are two of the most common health problems that people experience in their lives. While back pain can be caused by physical factors, such as poor posture or injury, it can also be influenced by psychological factors, such as stress. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between stress and back pain and how they can impact our health and well-being.\n\nSection 2: Understanding Stress\nStress is a normal part of life, and our bodies are designed to respond to stress in a healthy way. When we experience stress, our bodies release hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which prepare us to face the stressor. However, when stress becomes chronic, it can have negative effects on our health. Chronic stress has been linked to a wide range of health problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression.\n\nSection 3: How Stress Affects the Body\nWhen we experience stress, our bodies enter a state of fight-or-flight response, which triggers the release of stress hormones. These hormones can cause physical changes in the body, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. When stress becomes chronic, these physical changes can lead to inflammation and other health problems, including back pain.\n\nSection 4: The Link Between Stress and Back Pain\nResearch has shown that stress can contribute to the development of back pain. Chronic stress can cause muscle tension, which can lead to back pain. Additionally, stress can cause inflammation in the body, which can exacerbate existing back pain. Studies have also shown that people who experience high levels of stress are more likely to develop chronic back pain.\n\nSection 5: How to Manage Stress\nManaging stress is essential for maintaining good health and preventing back pain. There are many strategies that can help to reduce stress levels, including exercise, mindfulness meditation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Exercise has been shown to be particularly effective in reducing stress levels and preventing back pain. Mindfulness meditation can also be helpful in reducing stress and promoting relaxation.\n\nSection 6: The Role of Mindfulness in Stress Management\nMindfulness is a state of awareness in which we focus on the present moment without judgment. Mindfulness can be practiced through techniques such as meditation and deep breathing exercises. Research has shown that mindfulness can be an effective tool for managing stress and preventing back pain. By practicing mindfulness, we can become more aware of our thoughts and emotions, and learn to respond to stress in a healthy way.\n\nSection 7: The Importance of Posture in Back Pain Prevention\nPoor posture can contribute to the development of back pain. When we sit or stand with poor posture, it can put stress on the muscles and ligaments in the back, leading to pain and discomfort. Good posture is essential for preventing back pain. By maintaining good posture, we can reduce the stress on our back muscles and ligaments, and prevent back pain from developing.\n\nSection 8: Ergonomics in the Workplace\nMany people spend a significant amount of time sitting at a desk or using a computer at work. This can lead to poor posture and back pain. Ergonomics is the science of designing work environments that are safe and comfortable for people to use. By implementing ergonomic principles in the workplace, we can reduce the risk of back pain and other musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSection 9: The Benefits of Exercise for Back Pain Prevention\nExercise is an important component of back pain prevention. Regular exercise can help"}]}
