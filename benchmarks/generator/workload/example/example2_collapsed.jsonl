Analytical functions are used with the OVER clause and can be used to perform ranking, windowing, and aggregation operations. There are several analytical functions available in SQL, including ROW\\_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE\\_RANK, NTILE, LAG, LEAD, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT.\n\nExample: Suppose we have a table \"Sales\" with columns \"SaleID\", \"SaleDate\", \"Region\", \"SalesPerson\", and \"Amount\". To calculate the running total of sales for each salesperson, we can use the SUM() function with the OVER clause like this:\n```sql\nSELECT SaleID, SaleDate, Region, SalesPerson, Amount, SUM(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY SalesPerson ORDER BY SaleDate) AS RunningTotal\nFROM Sales;\n```\nThis will return a result set that includes the running total of sales for each salesperson:\n```yaml\nSaleID | SaleDate   | Region | SalesPerson | Amount | RunningTotal\n------+------------+--------+-------------+--------+--------------\n1     | 2022-01-01 | East   | John        | 100    | 100\n2     | 2022-01-02 | East   | John        | 200    | 300\n3     | 2022-01-03 | East   | John        | 150    | 450\n4     | 2022-01-01 | West   | Lisa        | 50     | 50\n5     | 2022-01-02 | West   | Lisa        | 250    | 300\n6     | 2022-01-03 | West   | Lisa        | 100    | 400\n7     | 2022-01-01 | North  | Mark        | 300    | 300\n8     | 2022-01-02 | North  | Mark        | 200    | 500\n9     | 2022-01-03 | North  | Mark        | 150    | 650\n```\nIn this example, the SUM() function is used to calculate the running total of sales for each salesperson. The PARTITION BY clause is used to partition the data by salesperson, and the ORDER BY clause is used to order the data by sale date. The OVER clause is used to specify the window over which the function is applied.\n\nOther examples of SQL Analytical Functions include:\n\n* ROW\\_NUMBER: assigns a unique number to each row within a result set.\n```sql\nSELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Amount DESC) AS Rank, SalesPerson, Amount\nFROM Sales;\n```\n* RANK and DENSE\\_RANK: assigns a ranking to each row based on a specified column.\n```sql\nSELECT RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY Amount DESC) AS Rank, SalesPerson, Amount\nFROM Sales;\n```\n* NTILE: assigns a group number to each row based on a specified number of groups.\n```sql\nSELECT NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY Amount DESC) AS Quartile, SalesPerson, Amount\nFROM Sales;\n```\n* LAG and LEAD: returns the value of a column from a previous or next row.\n```sql\nSELECT SaleID, SaleDate, SalesPerson, Amount, LAG(Amount) OVER (PARTITION BY SalesPerson ORDER BY SaleDate) AS PreviousAmount\nFROM Sales;\n```\n* COUNT: returns the number of rows in a result set.\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY Region) AS Count, SalesPerson, Amount\nFROM Sales;\n```"}, {"Prompt Length": 758, "Output Length": 14, "prompt": "And so it was, on that fateful day, as the sun dipped below the horizon, that James and his team gathered together to celebrate their achievements and to look toward the future. The air was filled with laughter and the clinking of glasses, as the brave souls who had faced so many hardships together toasted to the brighter days that lay ahead.\n\nWith each passing moment, the bond between them grew stronger, their shared experiences forging a connection that ran deeper than mere friendship. They had become a family, united by a common purpose and an unwavering belief in the power of their collective vision.\n\nAs the evening wore on, James stood before his team, a fire burning in his eyes as he shared his dreams for the future. He spoke of new innovations that could further revolutionize the way the world harnessed and consumed energy, of new markets that could be opened and new communities that could be reached.

It would take the collective effort of countless individuals from all corners of the globe, each contributing their own unique talents and perspectives to the cause. And as James looked out at the faces of his team, a motley crew of dreamers and doers, he knew in his heart that they were just the beginning.\n\nAs the years went by, James and his team continued their work, tirelessly pursuing new innovations and expanding the reach of their groundbreaking technology. They forged partnerships with like-minded organizations, their shared passion for a more sustainable world acting as a bridge across cultural, political, and geographical divides.\n\nAnd with each new challenge they faced, each new obstacle they overcame, the flame of hope that burned within them grew brighter, casting its light upon the world and illuminating the path to a more sustainable, more equitable future.\n\nIn time, James' name would become synonymous with progress and innovation, his story a testament to the power of the human spirit and the indomitable will of those who dare to dream.

For it is in the pursuit of these dreams that we find our true purpose, and it is in the realization of these dreams that we leave our mark upon the world.\n\nAnd as the sun sets on the horizon and a new day dawns, may we all find within ourselves the courage to chase our own dreams and the strength to overcome the challenges that lie ahead. For it is in these pursuits, as James and his team have shown us, that the future of our world rests, and it is through these pursuits that we create a lasting legacy for generations to come."}, {"Prompt Length": 778, "Output Length": 7, "prompt": "\\section{Human Evaluation in NLG}\n\nNatural Language Generation (NLG) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerned with the automatic production of human-like natural language texts from structured data or formal representations. Evaluating the quality of NLG systems is crucial to determine their effectiveness, and human evaluation is considered the most reliable and valid method to assess the quality of generated texts \\citep{belz2006comparing}. In this section, we will discuss the parameters of human evaluation in NLG, types of human evals, their limitations, difficulties, and tradeoffs, and why human evaluation is necessary over automatic evaluation.\n\n\\subsection{What is human evaluation, and why do we need it?}\n\nHuman evaluation is the process of assessing the quality of a generated text by human raters, who provide subjective judgments based on their own understanding of the text's meaning and their expectations for natural language output. Human evaluation is necessary for NLG systems since automatic metrics are not always reliable, and they do not capture all aspects of text quality \\citep{belz2006comparing}. Moreover, human evaluation can provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of an NLG system and help developers improve their systems.\n\n\\subsection{Parameters of human evaluation}\n\nEvaluating the quality of an NLG system is a complex task that involves different quality criteria, evaluation frameworks, and experimental designs. According to \\citet{belz2020disentangling}, an evaluation framework can be described in terms of the following parameters: (i) what is being evaluated (which aspect of quality), (ii) how it is evaluated in specific (a) evaluation modes and (b) experimental designs.\n\n\\subsubsection{Quality criteria}\n\nThere are different quality criteria that human evaluators may consider when assessing the quality of a generated text. For example, fluency, coherence, readability, and overall quality are common criteria used in NLG evaluation \\citep{belz2006comparing}. Other criteria may include grammaticality, correctness, relevance, informativeness, and diversity \\citep{pagnoni2021understanding}. The choice of quality criteria depends on the NLG task and the purpose of the evaluation.\n\n\\subsubsection{Evaluation framework}\n\nThe evaluation framework refers to the overall approach used to evaluate the quality of a generated text. It can be classified into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic \\citep{gkatzia-mahamood-2015-snapshot}.\n\n\\paragraph{Intrinsic evaluation} involves evaluating the quality of a generated text in isolation, without considering the context or task for which it was generated. This approach is useful when the primary goal is to evaluate the NLG system's linguistic competence or the quality of the output text. Examples of intrinsic evaluation methods include direct assessment (i.e., evaluating a generated text alone, without referencing other candidates) and Likert scales (i.e., rating a text on a scale from 1 to 5).\n\n\\paragraph{Extrinsic evaluation} involves evaluating the quality of a generated text in the context of a specific task or application. This approach is useful when the primary goal is to evaluate the NLG system's effectiveness or utility. Examples of extrinsic evaluation methods include user studies and task-based evaluations.\n\n\\subsubsection{Experimental designs}\n\nThe experimental design refers to the specific methodology used to collect human evaluations. There are different experimental designs, including:\n\n\\paragraph{Comparative evaluation} involves evaluating multiple generated texts and comparing them based on a specific quality criterion. This approach is useful when the primary goal is to compare different NLG systems or variations of the same system. Examples of comparative evaluation methods include paired comparison (i.e., choosing the better of two texts) and best-worst scaling (i.e.,"}, {"Prompt Length": 767, "Output Length": 10, "prompt": "Sure, here are some suggestions for b-roll/stock video clips/stock photos to accompany the script:\n\n[Visual] A person measuring their waist with a measuring tape\n\n[Script] \"Are you tired of feeling hungry all the time?
