The Hero\u2019s Journey is a structure that has been followed by some of the greatest stories ever told and ever lived.\n\nThe version of this journey described throughout the document is tailored for Kadence and is meant to serve as a reference point and a workspace for ideas, planning, and the execution of specialized tactics in order to continuously develop and progress the story which underlies the public representation of the ideas covered in this document.\n\nThe Journey, its associated ambitions, milestones, challenges, and gimmicks are experimental in nature, and thus are used to further our own research into the business of artist development, and quite possible leaving our mark on the World.\n\n## \\*\\*What is within this document?\\*\\*\n\nThis document contains a whole lot of useful information about characters, possible pathways of progression, theoretical understandings from The Hero\u2019s Journey, and much more. Overall, this document is a collection of all types of information that is relevant to the project undertakings described above.\n\n## \\*\\*How should this document be used?\\*\\*\n\nThis document should be seen strictly as an experimental guideline line used to plan and execute experimental content and plot lines with the intent of learning from experiment results and making changes to procedures in the future where necessary. With regards to content, the content database provided in this document will be used to visualize the potential timeline of events that will transpire once the official process has gone underway (ie. when the first piece of planned content is released to the public and the timeline must be adhered to.)\n\nIn addition to the content calendar, the document will be the gathering place for information deemed useful during the planning and execution process of projects such as the Docu-Series. This information serves to fuel the end-user content that is scheduled and created. By using the Hero\u2019s Journey as a guideline, maximum impact can be gradually attained via meticulous planning and execution of ordered story elements once it is distilled into its relevant parts here inside this document.\n\n## \\*\\*What is The Story\\*\\*\n\nThe Story is a character arch guideline for the Docu-series that is derived from the content of this page. It occurs over a discrete time period, subtly growing in both complexity and depth. The point of using a story is simple, it allows us as the creators of content to understand what type of activities, emotions, themes, places, people, and other story elements to include in order to progress the story, in film format, from a clear beginning to a decisive end without relying on specific events or in real life occurrences that might be outside of our control. By determining the characters in the story, as well as their personalities, aspirations, fears, hopes, and desires, we will be able to translate the implied reality of those characters into practical actions and plot points that can be made in the real world to add a touch of fantasy-like takeaways to the project.\n\nBy taking the time to understand both the created characters and their real life counterparts, we ensure maximum compatibility with your (you reading this document) own personal journey, as well as the journey of the characters within the story. This allows us to create a seamless and coherent narrative that will captivate and engage our audience, while also providing a meaningful and impactful experience for everyone involved.\n\nIn order to fully realize the potential of this project and to bring [The Story] to life, it is important to have a clear understanding of the key elements of The Hero\u2019s Journey, as well as an understanding of the specific goals and objectives of the project. With this information in hand, we can begin to craft a unique and compelling story that will capture the hearts and minds of our audience.\n\n### The Journey Ahead\n\nAs we embark on this journey, it is important to remember that this is an experiment and that the path ahead may be uncertain. However, by using The Hero\u2019s Journey as our guide, we can be sure to make the most of every opportunity that comes our way. With careful planning and execution, we can turn this project into something truly special and leave a lasting impact on the world.\n\"\n\n What is the next portion I should write?"}]}

They can adjust the inputs to see how different scenarios might impact crop growth and yield. This can help farmers make informed decisions about planting and crop management practices, ultimately leading to higher yields and profitability."}]}

Introduction\nIn England's countryside, there lived a young lass,\nWhose parents had passed, leaving her alone in a vast,\nEstate owned by her uncle, a man so austere,\nWho had no time for her, nor care to appear.\n\nMary was her name, and she felt quite alone,\nNo friends to play with, no one to call her own,\nBut one day while exploring, she found a surprise,\nA secret garden, hidden away from prying eyes.\n\n1. Discovery of the Garden\nThe garden was locked up, with a rusted old key,\nBut Mary was curious, she wanted to see,\nWhat was inside that garden, what lay beyond,\nSo she searched high and low, till she found the bond.\n\nAs she walked through the garden, she felt a strange thrill,\nSeeing flowers and trees that had been silent and still,\nFor years they had slept, but now they awoke,\nAnd Mary felt a stirring, a strange, joyous poke.\n\n1. Friendship with Dickon\nSoon, Mary met a boy, a farmer's son,\nHis name was Dickon, he was full of fun,\nHe showed her the ways of the garden, and how,\nTo plant, water, and care for each flower and bough.\n\nTogether they worked, till the garden was bright,\nWith colors so vivid, a truly wonderful sight,\nMary had found a friend, one that was true,\nSomeone who helped her, when she was feeling blue.\n\n1. The Transformation of the Garden\nOver time, the garden transformed, bloomed, and grew,\nMary and Dickon had done it, they knew what to do,\nThe garden was alive, with sounds and scents so rare,\nA place that was magical, beyond compare.\n\nThe garden became a symbol, of hope and of love,\nFor those who were hurting, who felt lost, who needed a shove,\nIt reminded them that with effort and care,\nThey too could grow something, that was lovely and fair.\n\n1. Conclusion\nMary had found something, beyond wealth or fame,\nA garden that grew, a friendship that came,\nFrom working together, and never giving up,\nEven when things seemed hard, like an empty cup.\n\nThe garden taught her, the value of life,\nAnd how even in sorrow, there's a chance to thrive,\nMary's journey was a lesson, for young and old,\nAbout the power of friendship, and the beauty that's told.\n\nMoral of the Story:\nThrough Mary's journey, we learn that friendship is key,\nTo growth, transformation, and living life fully,\nWith hard work and perseverance, anything's possible,\nA secret garden of love and hope, that's truly remarkable."}]}

The endpoint writes the request data to a temporary file, calls the Python script with the file path as an argument using a subprocess, and waits for the subprocess to complete. After the subprocess completes, the response data is read from a file that the Python script writes to, and the file is deleted. The response data is returned in the response body.\n\nThe Python script reads the request data from the file specified in the command line arguments and executes the service logic to generate the response data. It then calls a webhook in the Spring Boot application at the endpoint `/python-service-response` with the response data as the payload.

If the punch misses, Klutzy has a 20% chance to stumble and fall, causing him to become slowed and unable to attack for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds\n\nMana cost: 50/55/60/65/70\n\nW - Wild Swings: Klutzy becomes nearsighted and begins swinging his arms wildly, dealing 50/70/90/110/130 (+0.4 bonus attack damage) physical damage to all enemies within a small radius. While using this ability, Klutzy's movement speed is increased by 125 for the duration.\n\nDuration: 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds\n\nCooldown: 18/16/14/12/10 seconds\n\nMana cost: 70/80/90/100/110\n\nE - Slip n' Slide: Klutzy charges forward, sliding across the ground and leaving a slick surface behind him. Enemy champions who are caught in the slick surface have a 20% chance to slip and fall, becoming slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds\n\nMana cost: 60/65/70/75/80\n\nR - Pratfall: Klutzy takes a massive stumble, causing him to fall to the ground and become slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds. However, this also creates a large shockwave that knocks up and slows all enemy champions in a large radius by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 120/110/100 seconds\n\nMana cost: 100/110/120\n\nOverall, Klutzy is a clumsy, yet lovable champion who excels at providing utility and protection for his allies. While his clumsiness can sometimes get him into trouble, it also creates opportunities for his allies to capitalize on and turn the tide of the battle in their favor."}]}
{"timestamp": 1207, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 713, "Output Length": 61, "prompt": "Here's a basic implementation of a top-down recursive descent parser for LMLang. This implementation covers most of the constructs mentioned. However, due to the size and complexity of the task, some aspects such as error handling and reporting are simplified. You can extend and improve the parser as needed.\n```rust\nuse std::iter::Peekable;\nuse std::str::Chars;\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\npub enum ParseError {\n    UnexpectedToken(char),\n    UnexpectedEof,\n}\n\ntype ParseResult<T> = Result<T, ParseError>;\n\npub struct Parser<'a> {\n    input: Peekable<Chars<'a>>,\n}\n\nimpl<'a> Parser<'a> {\n    pub fn new(input: &'a str) -> Self {\n        Parser {\n            input: input.chars().peekable(),\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn next_char(&mut self) -> Option<char> {\n        self.input.next()\n    }\n\n    fn peek_char(&mut self) -> Option<&char> {\n        self.input.peek()\n    }\n\n    // Parsing functions for literals\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for identifiers\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for operators\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for expressions\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for control structures\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for function and class definitions\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for function calls\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for modules and imports\n    // ...\n\n    pub fn parse_program(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Program> {\n        let mut program = vec![];\n        while let Some(_) = self.peek_char() {\n            let stmt = self.parse_statement()?;\n            program.push(stmt);\n        }\n        Ok(program)\n    }\n}\n\npub fn parse(input: &str) -> ParseResult<Program> {\n    let mut parser = Parser::new(input);\n    parser.parse_program()\n}\n```\nThis basic parser implementation defines a `Parser` struct that wraps the input string and provides helper methods for parsing different language constructs. The `ParseError` enum represents various types of parse errors that may occur.\n\nFor each language construct, you'll need to implement parsing functions that consume input characters and construct the corresponding AST nodes. Due to space constraints, I have not provided implementations for all parsing functions here.\n\nFor example, you could implement parsing functions for literals like this:\n```rust\nfn parse_number(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn parse_string(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn parse_boolean(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nSimilarly, you'll need to implement parsing functions for other constructs like identifiers, operators, expressions, control structures, function and class definitions, function calls, and modules and imports.\n\nTo handle and report syntax errors, you can use the `ParseError` enum and return a `ParseResult` from each parsing function. You can improve the error handling and reporting by including more context, such as line and column numbers, and more specific error messages.\n\nFinally, the `parse_program` method serves as the parser entry point, parsing the entire LMLang source code into an AST. The `parse` function is provided as a convenient top-level function for parsing LMLang source code.\n\nKeep in mind that this basic implementation should be extended and improved to cover the entire LMLang syntax, handle error reporting better, and ensure correct precedence and associativity for operators."}]}

Here's a general overview of how to use the Decorator pattern:\n\n1. Define the base component - This is the original object that you want to add behavior to. Define an interface or abstract class that represents the basic functionality of the component.\n2. Create concrete components - These are the actual objects that implement the base component interface or abstract class.\n3. Create decorators - These are objects that wrap the base component and provide additional behavior. Decorators implement the same interface or abstract class as the base component, so they can be used in place of the original component.\n4. Add functionality - Decorators can add new functionality to the base component by implementing additional methods or modifying the behavior of existing methods.\n5. Compose objects - Decorators can be stacked on top of each other to add multiple layers of behavior. You can create a chain of decorators that wrap the base component, with each decorator adding its own behavior.\n6. Use the decorated object - The final object is a decorated version of the original component, with all the additional behavior provided by the decorators.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose you have a base component called `Coffee` that represents a simple cup of coffee. You want to add behavior to the coffee object to allow customers to add additional ingredients, such as sugar, milk, or whipped cream.\n\n1. Define the base component:\n```java\npublic interface Coffee {\n    public double getCost();\n    public String getDescription();\n}\n```\n2.

Over the past two decades it has become increasingly involved, whether this relates to outright purchases (and more recently disposals), or in terms of using gold to help boost commercial bank liquidity.\n\nGold Reserves\nIn Turkey, the CBRT\u2019s core activities, in terms of its management of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, are guided by Article 53 of the CBRT Law. Specifically for gold, this governs how the Bank may execute forward and/ or spot purchases and sales of gold and lending/borrowing transactions.\n\nUntil September 2011, the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves (as reported to the IMF) had remained essentially flat at 116.1t. Since then, its gross holdings have risen sharply, to reach 716.3t by end-2020. The increase largely reflects the adoption of more gold friendly policies by the Turkish government, which has increasingly promoted the role of gold in the financial system, while at the same time trying to lessen the country\u2019s dependence on the dollar. To help achieve these goals, aside from the CBRT making direct gold purchases from local and international markets, it has increasingly used other tools, including the Gold Monetisation Scheme, the Treasury\u2019s gold bond and gold lease certificate issuances and the CBRT\u2019s gold swaps programme with local commercial banks.\n\n1. CBRT\u2019s Own Reserves\nFocussing on the CBRT\u2019s own reserves, it was not until May 2017 that the central bank started to raise its holdings. In other words, the 320t increase in the CBRT\u2019s gross holdings between October 2011 and April 2017 was driven by the commercial banks\u2019 gold held through the reserve option mechanism (ROM).\n\nFrom 115.8t in April 2017, the CBRT\u2019s own holdings peaked at 440.6t in July 2020. This was followed by a period of disposals during August-December which totalled over 105t, these accounting for the largest share of global central bank sales at that time. This left the CBRT\u2019s own reserves at 334.7t by end-2020. These sales were largely driven by a deteriorating economic backdrop and currency crisis. After Turkish foreign exchange reserves dropped to a multi-decade low over the summer, some gold holdings are believed to have been mobilised to support the lira and/or repay international debt.\n\n2. Treasury\nPart of the growth in the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves also reflected the issuance of gold bonds and lease certificates by the Turkish Treasury, as gold collected via these programmes was transferred to the central bank\u2019s account. In September 2017, the Treasury decided to issue both an interest-bearing gold bond and also a gold sukuk (the Islamic equivalent of a bond, generating a return while still being compliant under Sharia law). Both were sold to the public in return for their physical gold.\n\nUnder this mechanism the public deposited their gold with the state-owned Ziraat Bank and, in return, the Treasury issued a gold bond or sukuk, both of which pay dividends in Turkish lira (TL) at regular intervals. At the point of maturity, investors have had two options. First, they can take back their gold in the form of Republic coins struck by the State Mint, Darphane. Alternatively, these instruments can be sold back before maturity to the Treasury with payment made in TL. Starting with a volume of 1.9t in October 2017 and, with the subsequent involvement of financial institutions, the total amount of these two instruments reached 60t by the end of 2020; with further auctions in 2021 boosting this figure to 94.7t by end-June 2021.\n\nCBRT\u2019s Gross Gold Holdings, by Location (1)\n\nSource: CBRT Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020\n1. All holdings are taken from the CBRT\u2019s Annual Financial Statements without any adjustment\n\n2. The reported CBRT\u2019s own gold includes gold swap with non-official entities. This explains why end-year figure in this table is higher than Metals Focus\u2019 estimate (334.7t at end-2020)\n\n3. Under the Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\n\n3. Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\nThe reserve option mechanism (ROM) has its roots in gold banking\u2019s evolution in Turkey. For many years, this was a niche area in the Turkish financial sector, with only one bank working on Islamic finance principles, Kuveyt Turk Kat\u0131l\u0131m Bankas\u0131, which introduced the first gold account in Turkey. However, there was little other commercial bank involvement until the CBRT started its gold monetisation scheme in 2012 through the ROM. This was first introduced in 2011 and its purpose was communicated by the CBRT as to limit the negative effects of excessive volatility of capital flows on the country\u2019s macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as also boosting the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves.\n\nAfter the gold monetisation scheme was launched, banks started to use the ROM more effectively. Simply put, as part of the ROM banks are allowed to hold a certain ratio of Turkish lira reserve requirements as foreign exchange and/or gold in increasing tranches. This affords an opportunity to use gold as a tool to create more room for lira credit lines. As a result, gold collected through the country\u2019s gold monetisation scheme and through gold banking accounts (offered by Turkish commercial banks) are channelled towards this use.\n\nIn terms of how the ROM applies to gold; since end-2012 and until 3rd October 2016, a maximum of 30% (known as the reserve option coefficient, ROC) of a bank\u2019s reserve liabilities could be offset against gold. This 30% was broken down into three tranches, each involving a different reserve option ratio. For the first 20% bracket, the ratio was set at 1.2, which meant that, for example, TL1.2m of gold was required to free up TL1m of Turkish Lira (TL) reserves. For the next 5% bracket, the ratio rose to 1.7, and for the last 5% the ratio stands at 2.2. The value of the gold is marked-to-market every 15 days.\n\nA new incentive announced by the CBRT on September 1, 2016 defined a further tranche of 5%, in addition to the existing 30% facility. This 5% also featured two new elements. First, it allowed only bullion refined from scrap gold collected by banks from the public after October 3, 2016 to be utilised, and excluded all other bullion from other sources.\n\nSecond, the reserve option ratio will be set to 1, which means there is a one-to-one conversion towards the ROC. The lower ROC suggests that banks will now be incentivised to attract consumer-held gold stocks since other forms of gold, such as metal acquired via electronic purchases, will not qualify.\n\nThis ruling was then amended on 18th January 2020, with the 30% ceiling reduced to 20%. On 24th February 2021, this was again reduced, this time to 15% and the scrap gold related tranche, which was first introduced as 5% and raised to 10% on 16th February 2019, has been further increased to 15%. Under this scheme, commercial banks have been allowed to use gold against a portion of their reserve liabilities. In turn, this encouraged banks to start gold collection days where they bought back gold from the public. Beforehand, gold deposit accounts did not pay interest, but it then became more common to do so, with interest rates peaking at around 2.4% by mid-2018. However, this trend then reversed. Today, interest can range from as low as 0.15% up to 1%, with some commercial banks offering interest-free gold bank accounts. This change reflects the increased reserve requirement ratios, which by 19th November 2020, stood at 18% for maturities of at least one-year and at 22% for lower maturity dates, depending on the bank in question. Furthermore, investor returns are subject to a 15% withholding tax for account holders over a minimum term starting from three to six months.\n\n4. Gold Swaps\nIn May 2019, the CBRT started to use gold swaps as another tool to regulate money supply and manage foreign exchange reserves. Under this new policy, commercial banks can swap a portion of their gold holdings with the CBRT in return for lira and foreign currency or vice versa. Gold swapped under this route will be transferred to the CBRT\u2019s account. To put this new policy into perspective, from 12.3t in May 2019, the total amount of gold swap jumped to 123.5t by end-2020. Summarize as points with headings"}]}

It is well-suited for simple scenarios where you just need to send a signal from one instance of the application to another.\n\nNamed pipes, on the other hand, are more complex and provide more robust inter-process communication. Named pipes are full-duplex communication channels that allow data to be transmitted in both directions between processes. Named pipes can be used to send not only signals, but also structured data between instances of an application.\n\nIf you just need to send a simple signal between instances of an application, then `EventWaitHandle` is the simpler option and may be the better choice.

Specifically, we used an Arduino microcontroller and connected it to various sensors, including temperature and humidity sensors. The fan was controlled by connecting it to a relay that was also controlled by the Arduino.\n\nTo read the data from the sensors, we used the analog and digital input pins on the Arduino board. We wrote software code in C++ to read the data from the sensors and then send control signals to the fan and other components based on that data. We also implemented various algorithms to ensure that the temperature and humidity levels stayed within the desired ranges.\n\nIn terms of ensuring reliability and efficiency, we tested and validated the system extensively before deploying it. We used a combination of unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to ensure that the system met our design goals. We also incorporated various safety features, such as fail-safe mechanisms and over-temperature protection, to ensure that the system was safe to operate.\n\nOverall, the system was designed to be highly reliable and efficient, with minimal energy consumption and optimized control algorithms."}]}

The root ID is used to represent the top-level of the media hierarchy, and the other IDs represent different categories or filters for the media content.\n```swift\nprivate List<MediaBrowser.MediaItem> mRootItems = new ArrayList<>();\nprivate BrowserRoot mRoot;\n\nprivate DataModel mDataModel;\nprivate Player mPlayer;\nprivate MediaSession mSession;\nprivate String mLastCategory;\n```\nThese are class variables used throughout the service. `mRootItems` is a list of `MediaBrowser.MediaItem` objects representing the root items. `mRoot` is a `BrowserRoot` object representing the root of the media hierarchy. `mDataModel` is an instance of the `DataModel` class, which is responsible for querying the media content. `mPlayer` is an instance of the `Player` class, which handles playback of the media content. `mSession` is an instance of the `MediaSession` class, which represents a single media session. `mLastCategory` is a string that stores the last category that was browsed by the client.\n```scss\n@Override\npublic void onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate();\n\n    mDataModel = new DataModel(this);\n    addRootItems();\n    mSession = new MediaSession(this, MEDIA_SESSION_TAG);\n    setSessionToken(mSession.getSessionToken());\n    mPlayer = new Player(this, mSession, mDataModel);\n    mSession.setCallback(mPlayer);\n    mSession.setFlags(MediaSession.FLAG_HANDLES_MEDIA_BUTTONS\n            | MediaSession.FLAG_HANDLES_TRANSPORT_CONTROLS);\n    mPlayer.maybeRestoreState();\n\n    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();\n    filter.addAction(ACTION_PLAY);\n    filter.addAction(ACTION_PAUSE);\n    filter.addAction(ACTION_NEXT);\n    filter.addAction(ACTION_PREV);\n    registerReceiver(mNotificationReceiver, filter, Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED);\n}\n```\nThis is the `onCreate()` method, which is called when the service is created. It initializes the `mDataModel` variable with a new instance of the `DataModel` class, adds the root items using the `addRootItems()` method, creates a new `MediaSession` instance and sets its callback to `mPlayer`, sets some flags for the `MediaSession`, restores the playback state using the `maybeRestoreState()` method of `mPlayer`, and registers a `BroadcastReceiver` to receive media button events from the notification.\n```csharp\nprivate void addRootItems() {\n    MediaDescription folders = new MediaDescription.Builder()\n            .setMediaId(FOLDERS_ID)\n            .setTitle(getString(R.string.f\n```"}]}

{"timestamp": 8267, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3166, "Output Length": 86, "prompt": "Part 4 (acknowledge and await part 5 and any other parts):\n\nTrenton (Trenton Journal)\n\nThe second community for which we assessed information needs was Trenton. The survey was distributed by Miles, owner of The Trenton Journal, to people in his network, including the nonprofit community foundation for which he also works, as well as prominent churches. Miles also posted a link to the survey in his newsletter and on his website. As in Paterson, we also created a printed flyer with the survey link and a QR code. Because of the financial incentive, we had a number of false responses by bots or people trying to game the drawing, which we also saw in Paterson. The final N, after cleaning, was 119 (recall that all questions were optional, so the numbers reported below often do not add up to 119).\n\nThe survey respondents were distributed evenly among the four wards of Trenton; this suggests that Trenton Journal\u2019s coverage of the four wards should be roughly equal. \n\nTable 1: Where survey respondents live\nEast Ward \nNorth Ward\nSouth Ward\nWest Ward\n21\n25\n23\n22\nThe graphic below shows how long the respondents have lived in Trenton. There is marked variation here depending on the ward; in the West, South and North wards, more than 65% of residents have lived there for at least six years, while in the south ward more than 55% of residents have been there for at least 11 years, showing depth of connection to the community. The East ward is the most evenly distributed and has the greatest percentage of residents who have been there for less than a year; notably, all of the respondents from the North ward have lived there for at least a year. The focus group respondents also tended to be people who have lived in the city for a decade or longer (we did not differentiate their answers by ward).\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nIn general, the respondents who live in Trenton\u2019s South Ward stood out as having different experiences and opinions in many cases, compared to residents of other wards. Perhaps surprisingly, given how long people have lived in the area, they were much more likely to say their community is a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d place to live (43%). For comparison, only 23% of the East Ward, 19% of the West Ward, and 20% of the North Ward residents said the same (see graphic below). Because of this and other marked differences, the responses of South Ward residents were considered separately for the analysis.\n\nRespondents from the West ward were generally happiest with their community\u2019s quality of life, with more than half stating that Trenton is a good or excellent place to live, followed by respondents from the East and North wards, where roughly half think the same. By contrast, nearly half of respondents from the South ward said Trenton is a poor or terrible place to live, and the fewest calling it a fair place to live, showing the strongest division of opinion on the question. \n\nWe asked people to describe the community in one sentence. Some of the responses were negative:\n\nThere are a lot of empty houses in my neighborhood.\nLack of police presence.\nLots of crime and gangs.\n\nBut others struck a balanced and nuanced view of the strengths and challenges:\nEclectic mix of good and bad.\nTrenton should be so much nicer than it is, but it is well located and there is lots in the surrounding area that is wonderful.\nA good community where good people and good news is lost in the bad press and violence by a few in the community.\nYou can see the beauty within the struggle.\nIt depends where you live in the community.\n\nPeople in both focus groups acknowledged problems with the area \u2013 lack of repairs to facilities and problems accessing public information came up several times \u2013 but also emphasized the many positive sides of Trenton and of the people who live there. They wanted to hear more about these positive stories and have easier access to public information to fix the things that are wrong; these comments informed the recommendations that we made to the publisher (listed below).\n\nWhat are Trenton\u2019s information needs?\n\nAbout 6 in 10 survey respondents said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to keep up with local news. Meanwhile, 40% said it is harder today to keep up with local news compared to three years ago. Only 23% said it was easier. The focus group participants reported following news at the national, state and local levels, usually through mass media such as cable news networks or the evening news. Both survey and focus group participants said they would be excited about a local news source that filled the existing information gaps in Trenton. \n\nSatisfaction/concern\n\nOne survey question asked whether each topic is a significant source of either satisfaction or concern in the community. On many topics, the respondents from Trenton disagreed. The most polarizing issue was crime and safety: 33% feel crime is high and they are unsafe there, while 46% of people think the opposite. \n\nThere were four topics where at least 15% of the people strongly agreed but another at least 15% strongly disagreed:\nCrime is low/high.\nEntertainment options are good/bad.\nJobs are satisfactory/unsatisfactory.\nThe environment is clean/unclean.\n\nAdditionally, local government and politics was the issue most people had an opinion about. Only 10% said this was not important to them. Fifty percent agreed that local officials are effective and trustworthy, while 33% disagreed. The responses to these topic-based questions suggested to us that the Journal will want to be even-handed in its coverage, especially of these divisive local topics.\n\nSome topics, however, evoked agreement:\nThe community\u2019s history. A total of 32% strongly agreed and 60% at least somewhat agreed that Trenton has history and traditions to be proud of.\nSports. A total of 58% agreed that local sports are fun and exciting to follow, while only 21% disagreed.\nSocial issues. A total of 56% agreed that the community shares their values on issues like race, immigration, and abortion.\n\nAnother survey question asked, \u201cHow important is it for you personally to read the following types of information in the Trenton Journal?\u201d\n\nRespondents said the most important topics of coverage were crime, sports, health care, and local government. There were large groups who were \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in other topics: entertainment options, local history and traditions, and local arts and culture. Twenty-six percent said that family life is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them.\nHow people use and access local news\n\nTo better understand The Trenton Journal community\u2019s information needs and the motivations that drive them to seek out local news, we asked them to name the most important reasons they follow local news. The top response was \u201cto stay informed and be a better citizen\u201d (37%). \n\nAfter that nearly a third of respondents said they use local news for entertainment, hobbies, and sports (33%), or to \u201cfind places to go and things to do\u201d (30%). Twenty-eight percent said local news helped them in their job and 26% said it helped them stay safe and avoid crime. These answers point to the importance of \u201cservice journalism,\u201d a simple but extremely practical and helpful practice.\n\nThere were a few most-common ways that survey respondents discover local news in Trenton. Each of these is used every day by 3 in 10 survey respondents, and at least weekly by 50 to 60% of them:\nFrom friends / family.\nGoogle searches.\nReading Facebook News Feed.\nReading Facebook Groups.\n\nFacebook is a major factor in the local news ecosystem of the survey respondents. Nearly 8 in 10 are getting local news and information there regularly. Half use Facebook for news at least once a week. Notably, the everyday news engagement is slightly stronger for Facebook Groups than for Facebook News Feed.\n\nFrequency of use for news\nFacebook News Feed\nFacebook Group\nEvery day\n23%\n28%\nWeekly or more\n55%\n51%\nA few times a month or more\n78%\n67%\nSeparately, we asked people how satisfied they are with various local news sources, including some Facebook Groups. The Facebook Groups ranked higher in satisfaction than any other news source. For example the Group named \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d rated highly, with 25% saying they \u201clove it and use it all the time\u201d and a total of 60% saying they at least \u201cfind it useful and use it sometimes.\u201d Another 18% \u201cdon\u2019t love it, but \u201cuse it when I have to.\u201d Only 10% avoid it and 12% never heard of or used it. The Group named \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton\u201d was more polarizing: 28% \u201clove it\u201d and 16% \u201cdislike\u201d it. Nonetheless, 50% of respondents find it useful sometimes and 65% at least use it when they have to. Focus group participants also reported accessing local news via Facebook, as well as from family/friends and from local television news, in particular on News 12 New Jersey.\n\nOther social networks are used by a smaller number of respondents, suggesting either that the Journal should be cautious about devoting too many scarce resources to other platforms or that the survey and focus groups did not reach community members who use these for local news and information.\n\nSocial network\nPercent using daily\nPercent using 1-2 times a week or more\nInstagram\n19%\n43%\nTwitter\n12%\n37%\nTikTok\n14%\n31%\n\nMeanwhile, about 45% of survey respondents use Trenton Journal social media accounts at least weekly, and 68% visit at least a few times a month. The other newspapers we asked about \u2014 The Trentonian, Trenton Daily, and The Times of Trenton \u2014 ranked lower in satisfaction; these may be secondary sources for some of the Journal\u2019s readers.\nWe also asked survey respondents to name any sources that they \u201ctrust the most for useful, reliable local news and information.\u201d There were a few individual responses to that question that might suggest nontraditional sources with whom the Journal may want to build relationships:\nLuz Esperanza y Vida organization.\nEast Trenton committee.\nTrenton Waves podcast.\nStreet ministries.\nThe Old Mill Hill Society.\n\nWhat people think of Trenton Journal\n\nRespondents generally enjoy Trenton Journal\u2019s content on social media: 21% \u201clove\u201d Trenton Journal social media and use it all the time. Another 41% (the most common answer) say Trenton Journal\u2019s social media is \u201cuseful and use it sometimes.\u201d Only 12% dislike its social accounts, and 12% haven\u2019t heard of them yet. Opinions were stronger among residents of the South Ward. They have a more favorable opinion of Trent Journal\u2019s social media accounts (32% \u201clove it\u201d, another 45% say \u201cuseful sometimes\u201d), and they rated Trenton Journal\u2019s social media accounts as more satisfying than any other local news source. \n\nTrenton Journal\u2019s website and emails were a bit less popular than their social media; still, a majority do find them useful. The website or emails are used by 47% at least weekly and at least 61% visit at least a few times a month. These somewhat contradictory findings should be explored in follow-up conversations with community members or further research.\n\nReader opinion\nTrenton Journal\u2019s \nsocial media accounts\nTrenton Journal\u2019s\n website and emails\n\u201cLove it, use it all the time\u201d\n21%\n19%\n\u201cI find it useful and use it sometimes\u201d\n41%\n39%\n\u201cI dislike it and avoid using it\u201d\n12%\n18%\nNever heard or it or used it\n12%\n9%\n\nWe asked the people familiar with Trenton Journal how well it does certain things. At least 60% of people think it does these things at least \u201cfairly well\u201d:\nIs fair to all sides.\nIs neutral and doesn't take positions on issues.\nActs as a watchdog of powerful institutions and people.\nMakes the news entertaining.\nProvides diverse points of view.\nMakes it easier to find important civic information.\nHelps people understand communities unlike their own.\nVerifies and gets the facts right.\n\nSlightly fewer people, about 55%, think it does these things at least fairly well:\nProvides forums for community discussions,\nReports on possible solutions to problems in society,\n\nAt the same time, a sizeable minority (about 40% of people) thought the Trenton Journal did those things poorly, so there is room to improve. \n\nAs part of the research design, we devised several recommendations for each publisher based on analysis of the data from the survey and focus groups. The recommendations we presented to the Trenton Journal are below, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\n\nRecommendations given to the Trenton Journal\n\nCreate a dedicated section for posting the dates and times of upcoming municipal meetings, similar to your events page; publicize it via your newsletter and social media.\nGo one step further and cover municipal meetings regularly, even if it\u2019s simply by providing a transcript.\nConsider adding a section on your website that lists all city and state departments, the services they provide, and their contact information.\nConsider offering different sub-pages for each ward, that can be tailored to the differing concerns and interest in each.\nEngage to a greater extent on Facebook, and be present on Facebook groups that are relevant in Trenton, especially \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d and \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton.\u201d\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, Trenton Journal decided to make the following changes:\n\nIncrease coverage of municipal meetings, the education system, and crime and safety.\n\nCreate a tab on the website\u2019s resource page to house publicly available data about the city.\n\nCreate an online directory of public officials and other power-holders in the city; increase coverage of them through profiles and interviews.\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them how often they visited Trenton Journal\u2019s website, how they felt about each of these changes, and for any other open-ended feedback they might provide. For each of the changes, we asked whether they agreed or disagreed with this change, and if they disagreed, what they\u2019d like to see done instead. Again the sample was disappointingly small (N=9), but generally positive.\n\nFour of the nine reported visiting the website daily, while three said they visit a few times a week and one said rarely. Perhaps not surprisingly (since the changes were based on community feedback), there was overwhelming agreement with the changes that Trenton Journal is making. However when there was disagreement there was valuable feedback, such as the suggestion to focus on neighborhoods rather than the education system, or to provide data about the percentage of rentals to ownership and information about rental building ownership as part of the publicly available data. One open-ended response stated, \u201cI love the idea of covering municipal government and the people that are associated with it.\u201d"}]}

{"timestamp": 9179, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2092, "Output Length": 111, "prompt": "Lyft redesign \u2014 a UX case study\n\nI went to a Design Guru Summit workshop on May 17th. At the workshop,\n\nFrank Yoo\n, Lyft\u2019s head of UX and product design at Lyft, talked about the Lyft re-design. I learned useful design insights from his presentation and I wanted to share some takeaways with my design team at work. On May 26th, I met\nVicki Tan\n, Lyft\u2019s product designer, at Tech in Motion + Verizon Present: Data and Design Tech Talk. She generously shared how their design team did A/B testing, and answered a few questions I had regarding their UX challenges. In order to better support my takeaways presentation, I did extra homework by researching more about the re-design online, and then creating a case study.\n\nWorkshop Notes\n1. Lyft 4 year Overview\nYear 1: Market Fit\nYear 2: Unlocking Supply\nYear 3: Growth \u2014 Growth levers, new regions, marketing (data numbers)\nYear 4: Case Study \u2014 Redesign Lyft\n\n2. Lyft Redesign Goals\n\u009a\u2022 Scale for the future\n\u2022 Provide better context\n\u2022 Improve ergonomics and discoverability\n\n3. Lyft Design Principles\n\u2022 Nail the basics \u2014 Clear choice and context\n\u2022 Build confidence \u2014 Consistency and transparent\n\u2022 Be unique \u2014 Own-able and delightful\n\n1\u20133 are notes I took from\n\nFrank Yoo\n\u2019s presentation at the Design Gurus Summit workshop.\n\nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs\nLyft used this concept to define their design principles in a Pyramid shape. I was fascinated by how Lyft integrated psychology to define the principles order of importance.\n\nAs a designer, I often run into situations where people have different ideas about design decisions; it can be tough to judge without any design principles. Therefore, with the encouragement from my colleague\n\nKlara Pelcl\n, I convinced our leadership to let me and\nJules Cheung\ninitiate and collaboratively set core design principles among our design team.\nWe brainstormed together and created our own 6 principles: Know Your User, Clarity, Consistency, Efficiency, Collaboration and Beauty. By looking at Lyft\u2019s design principles graphic, it encouraged me to think about what we can do next to apply them in practice.\n\nOnline Resource\nUX Challenges\nI wanted to know what type of UX challenges Lyft faced while designing the app. I was glad to find some useful resource from Nectar Design, where\n\nFrank\ndid a webinar about how Lyft handles UX challenges, and used the same pyramid method to tackle UX challenges. Here is a summary from Nectar Design:\n\u2022 Usability \u2014 It must solve a compelling user issue\n\u009a\u2022 Reliability \u2014 Everything must work seamlessly and be as transparent as possible (Ex: ride times and costs)\n\u2022 Differentiate \u2014 It must be visually and interactively interesting (Ex: Lyft\u2019s glowing buttons and interactive options menu)\nReasons for Redesign\nDuring the webinar,\n\nFrank\ntalked about the reasons they re-designed the Lyft app, something I wish I could have asked him in person. Again thanks to Nectar Design I was able to find the reasons:\n\u2022 \u009aPoor representation of the driver that is requested\n\u2022 \u009aNo transparency about price or estimated time of arrival\n\u2022 Cars were not directional\n\u2022 \u009aPoor use of color\n\u2022 Options panel awkwardly placed\n\u009a\u2022 Request Lyft is vague for first time users\nSuccess Analysis\nNow you probably want to know what results the Lyft re-design achieved. I might not be able to cover everything here but I\u2019ll share what I have so far.\n\n1. Enhanced Transparency and Safety\nAfter the system matches you with a driver, you can see all the important information you need \u2014 your driver\u2019s name and the color/model of his/her car. More importantly, displaying the driver\u2019s license plate number helps you quickly pick the right car so you know you\u2019re with the right driver.\n2. Better Usage of Primary Color\nFrom what I can see, Lyft uses hot pink as the primary color, and purple as the secondary. During the workshop\n\ntalked about the pink color and how they decided to limit the use of it, applying it only in important situations. My understanding is that they made the pink color an action item color, such as the logo, the \u201cRequest Lyft\u201d button, the destination pin and \u201cFree Rides\u201d on your profile menu.\n\n3. Price Estimate Feature\nThe new UI includes a feature that allows users to get a ride\u2019s quote. By clicking on \u201cPrice estimate\u201d (see the image above), you have a good understanding of how much the ride is going to cost you. For example, a trip to Spicy King restaurant in Chinatown will cost me about $7-$11 from my pickup location.\n\n4. Made It Ergonomic\nErgonomics make the user experience much better. The older app design had actions at both the top and bottom of the screen, which made it harder to use because your fingers had to cross the screen back and forth. What about the new design? I really like it myself as a user for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 Tab Menu\nAll important menu actions are now at the bottom of the app, where you can select a type of ride you need (Carpool, Line, Regular Lyft, Plus and Premier), and you can set a pickup location right after. The UI for further actions in the request flow are also located in the same spot, resulting in a seamless experience.\n\u2022 Lyft Cars\nOn the map, the little Lyft cars were re-designed nicely, with a hint of pink and purple that shows color consistency across the app. Cars now turn directionally, which is a big help to people like me who don\u2019t have a great sense of direction with maps \u2014 I can now easily figure out if the car I requested is heading towards my location or if the driver is going the opposite way (which also explains why sometime it takes longer than the estimated arrival time).\n\u2022 Options Before Car Arrival\nThe new UI provides 4 options (Cancel, Split, Send ETA, Call driver) to users before their car arrives. I remember the hard time I had with the older UI, when I had to call my driver but couldn\u2019t find the button. Ease of use is much greater with all the options displayed up in front.\nUX Research\nLyft has different type of users \u2014 passengers and drivers, how does UX research collaborate with design? As I mentioned in the beginning,\n\nVicki Tan\nshared her insights during the panel at Tech in Motion + Verizon Present: Data and Design Tech Talk, where I learned quite a bit about their research.\n\u2022 Qualitative data vs. Quantitative data\nLike many other companies, Lyft is metrics-driven and focuses on quantitative analysis (usually the numbers and graphs can be shared with the teams and the stakeholders in many formats, such as email, keynotes). However, quantitative data needs analysis to be useful. Because of that, qualitative data comes in handy and that\u2019s what they focus on more now.\n\n\u2022 Gather User Feedback\nAccording to\n\n, Lyft invites real users (both passengers and drivers) to do regular weekly Q&A sessions in the office to ask them questions and listen to their feedback. By doing so, the design team learns if the users understand the features and what can be improved.\nI believe Lyft also uses other methods to collect qualitative data, so I did some research online and it looks like Lyft has been using \u201cLookback\u201d to aggregate a database of experiences where they can generate a montage of user feedback to better understand their needs. I tried \u201cLookback\u201d a few months ago, and found it very easy to record prototype testing on mobile. At my company, our design and UX research team have been using \u201cValidately\u201d to do both moderated and unmoderated testing.\n\n\u2022 A/B testing\nDuring re-design progress, Lyft ran many A/B tests. As a result,\n\nfound that the design they wanted was not the design the users wanted. At work, my design team faces this struggle all the time where we have different assumptions about what works for users the best. Without A/B testing, we are essentially designing features that suit our best interests, and might not be what the real users need.\n\u2022 Outcome\nAccording to Nectar Design, Lyft has conducted hundreds of hours of user testing and validates their assumptions along the way. This is good because it builds confidence in the team, stakeholders, and customers.\n\nConclusion\nHere is what I learned from doing this case study:\n\nOrganizing and structuring design principles is just as important as creating them in the first place. I\u2019ll continue finding ways to better structure the design principles we created at work, and visualize them so that everyone can get a good understanding of it across the organization.\nDon\u2019t be afraid of doing product re-designs. If you have good reasons and understand what the usability issues are, start planning! Get to know your real users \u2014 user testing is the key. Collect as much quantitative user behavior data as you can, then analyze and categorize them to make sure you have solid qualitative data to support re-design thinking. Follow the cycle of design, release, get user feedback and iterate.\nLyft\u2019s re-design is a great example to show how to create a successful product. If you care about your users, put yourself in their shoes to understand what they need and what they actually do when using a product. If you don\u2019t have a UX research team yet, build one or become a researcher yourself! At work, I work closely with our UX research team, they help the design team tons by recruiting users, setting up user testing, and analyzing the massive data comes in every month. Thanks to their hard work, the design team can take over the numbers and metrics, analyze further to define specific usability areas, and to communicate re-design decisions to our leadership.\nLyft\u2019s re-design case study helped me understand how other companies generate business value by implementing great design in both UI and UX. It gives me confidence that if we apply similar principles, and keep doing what we are doing on UX research, our product team can help the company product achieve much more success in the near future.\n\nGive an overview of this case study"}]}
