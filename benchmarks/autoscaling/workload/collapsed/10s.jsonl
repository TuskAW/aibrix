The Hero\u2019s Journey is a structure that has been followed by some of the greatest stories ever told and ever lived.\n\nThe version of this journey described throughout the document is tailored for Kadence and is meant to serve as a reference point and a workspace for ideas, planning, and the execution of specialized tactics in order to continuously develop and progress the story which underlies the public representation of the ideas covered in this document.\n\nThe Journey, its associated ambitions, milestones, challenges, and gimmicks are experimental in nature, and thus are used to further our own research into the business of artist development, and quite possible leaving our mark on the World.\n\n## \\*\\*What is within this document?\\*\\*\n\nThis document contains a whole lot of useful information about characters, possible pathways of progression, theoretical understandings from The Hero\u2019s Journey, and much more. Overall, this document is a collection of all types of information that is relevant to the project undertakings described above.\n\n## \\*\\*How should this document be used?\\*\\*\n\nThis document should be seen strictly as an experimental guideline line used to plan and execute experimental content and plot lines with the intent of learning from experiment results and making changes to procedures in the future where necessary. With regards to content, the content database provided in this document will be used to visualize the potential timeline of events that will transpire once the official process has gone underway (ie. when the first piece of planned content is released to the public and the timeline must be adhered to.)\n\nIn addition to the content calendar, the document will be the gathering place for information deemed useful during the planning and execution process of projects such as the Docu-Series. This information serves to fuel the end-user content that is scheduled and created. By using the Hero\u2019s Journey as a guideline, maximum impact can be gradually attained via meticulous planning and execution of ordered story elements once it is distilled into its relevant parts here inside this document.\n\n## \\*\\*What is The Story\\*\\*\n\nThe Story is a character arch guideline for the Docu-series that is derived from the content of this page. It occurs over a discrete time period, subtly growing in both complexity and depth. The point of using a story is simple, it allows us as the creators of content to understand what type of activities, emotions, themes, places, people, and other story elements to include in order to progress the story, in film format, from a clear beginning to a decisive end without relying on specific events or in real life occurrences that might be outside of our control. By determining the characters in the story, as well as their personalities, aspirations, fears, hopes, and desires, we will be able to translate the implied reality of those characters into practical actions and plot points that can be made in the real world to add a touch of fantasy-like takeaways to the project.\n\nBy taking the time to understand both the created characters and their real life counterparts, we ensure maximum compatibility with your (you reading this document) own personal journey, as well as the journey of the characters within the story. This allows us to create a seamless and coherent narrative that will captivate and engage our audience, while also providing a meaningful and impactful experience for everyone involved.\n\nIn order to fully realize the potential of this project and to bring [The Story] to life, it is important to have a clear understanding of the key elements of The Hero\u2019s Journey, as well as an understanding of the specific goals and objectives of the project. With this information in hand, we can begin to craft a unique and compelling story that will capture the hearts and minds of our audience.\n\n### The Journey Ahead\n\nAs we embark on this journey, it is important to remember that this is an experiment and that the path ahead may be uncertain. However, by using The Hero\u2019s Journey as our guide, we can be sure to make the most of every opportunity that comes our way. With careful planning and execution, we can turn this project into something truly special and leave a lasting impact on the world.\n\"\n\n What is the next portion I should write?"}, {"Prompt Length": 557, "Output Length": 21, "prompt": "Sure, here's an expanded code for the crop simulator:\n```python\nclass CropSimulator:\n    def __init__(self, crop_type, climate_data, soil_data):\n        self.crop_type = crop_type\n        self.climate_data = climate_data\n        self.soil_data = soil_data\n        self.days_to_maturity = self.get_days_to_maturity()\n        self.growth_stage = 0\n        self.daily_gdd = self.get_daily_gdd()\n\n    def get_days_to_maturity(self):\n        # calculate days to maturity based on crop type\n        if self.crop_type == \"Corn\":\n            days_to_maturity = 100\n        elif self.crop_type == \"Wheat\":\n            days_to_maturity = 120\n        elif self.crop_type == \"Soybeans\":\n            days_to_maturity = 80\n        else:\n            days_to_maturity = 0\n            print(\"Error: Invalid crop type specified.\")\n        return days_to_maturity\n\n    def get_daily_gdd(self):\n        # calculate daily growing degree days (GDD) based on climate data\n        daily_gdd = []\n        for temp in self.climate_data:\n            gdd = (temp - 10) / 2\n            if gdd < 0:\n                gdd = 0\n            daily_gdd.append(gdd)\n        return daily_gdd\n\n    def simulate_growth(self, days):\n        # simulate crop growth over a specified number of days\n        for i in range(days):\n            if self.growth_stage == 0 and self.daily_gdd[i] >= 10:\n                self.growth_stage = 1\n                print(\"Crop has emerged.\")\n            elif self.growth_stage == 1 and self.daily_gdd[i] >= 15:\n                self.growth_stage = 2\n                print(\"Crop is in vegetative growth stage.\")\n            elif self.growth_stage == 2 and self.daily_gdd[i] >= 20:\n                self.growth_stage = 3\n                print(\"Crop is in reproductive growth stage.\")\n            elif self.growth_stage == 3 and i >= self.days_to_maturity:\n                self.growth_stage = 4\n                print(\"Crop is ready for harvest.\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Crop is still growing.\")\n```\nWith this simulation code, farmers can input their crop type, climate data, and soil data to simulate crop growth and visualize the potential outcomes before planting. They can adjust the inputs to see how different scenarios might impact crop growth and yield. This can help farmers make informed decisions about planting and crop management practices, ultimately leading to higher yields and profitability."}, {"Prompt Length": 547, "Output Length": 29, "prompt": "1. Does the RESTRICT Act violate the First Amendment right to free speech?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act focuses on national security risks and user privacy concerns related to certain transactions and holdings involving information and communication technology products or services. It does not directly address freedom of speech. However, critics may argue that the Act's potential to restrict access to certain platforms, like TikTok, could infringe on the First Amendment right to free speech. While the Act itself does not ban individual use of these platforms, it could still limit access to them and therefore have an impact on free speech. Ultimately, it will be up to the courts to determine if any specific actions taken under the Act violate the First Amendment.\n\n1. Is the RESTRICT Act too broad in its scope?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act gives the Secretary of Commerce broad authority to review and potentially restrict certain transactions and holdings involving information and communication technology products or services. Some may argue that this authority is too broad and could potentially be abused or used to unfairly target certain entities or individuals. However, supporters of the Act argue that this broad authority is necessary to effectively address national security risks and user privacy concerns related to foreign-owned platforms and products.\n\n1. Could the RESTRICT Act negatively impact international relations?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act may have an impact on international relations, particularly with countries whose companies and platforms may be subject to review under the Act. Critics may argue that the Act could be seen as overly aggressive and could potentially strain relationships with foreign governments. However, supporters of the Act may argue that it is necessary to protect national security and that the potential impact on international relations is outweighed by the benefits of increased security.\n\n1. Could the RESTRICT Act be used to unfairly target certain countries or companies?\n\nCritics of the RESTRICT Act may argue that it could be used to unfairly target certain countries or companies, particularly those that are seen as political or economic rivals to the United States. However, supporters of the Act may argue that the focus is on national security and user privacy concerns, rather than political or economic motivations. Ultimately, it will be up to the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that any actions taken under the Act are based on legitimate concerns related to national security and user privacy.\n\n1. How will the RESTRICT Act impact the global tech industry?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act could potentially have a significant impact on the global tech industry, particularly if it leads to increased restrictions on foreign-owned platforms and products. This could lead to increased competition among domestic companies, as well as increased pressure on foreign companies to conform to US regulations. However, it could also lead to decreased innovation and collaboration among global tech companies, as they may become more hesitant to work with each other due to potential national security risks."}, {"Prompt Length": 661, "Output Length": 36, "prompt": "Here are 10 lines with data samples based on the structure provided for travel photography:\n\nParis, Eiffel Tower, Street caf\u00e9, Cityscape, Evening, Natural, Rule of thirds, Canon EOS R6, 16-35mm f/2.8, f/4, 800, 1/60, 24mm, Wide-angle\nKyoto, Fushimi Inari Shrine, Geisha, Cultural scene, Morning, Natural, Leading lines, Nikon D850, 35mm f/1.4, f/2.8, 400, 1/200, 35mm, Portrait\nSydney, Opera House, Beach, Coastal landscape, Sunset, Golden hour, Negative space, Sony A7R IV, 24-70mm f/2.8, f/5.6, 100, 1/125, 50mm, Landscape\nNew York, Times Square, Street performer, Urban scene, Night, Artificial, Centered, Fujifilm X-T4, 23mm f/1.4, f/2, 1600, 1/100, 23mm, Street\nRio de Janeiro, Christ the Redeemer, Carnival, Cityscape, Midday, Natural, Rule of thirds, Nikon Z6 II, 70-200mm f/2.8, f/8, 200, 1/250, 85mm, Telephoto\nVenice, Grand Canal, Gondolier, Cultural scene, Sunrise, Soft light, Leading lines, Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III, 12-40mm f/2.8, f/4, 400, 1/160, 25mm, Cityscape\nBanff, Moraine Lake, Hiking, Mountain landscape, Afternoon, Natural, Symmetry, Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, 16-35mm f/4, f/11, 100, 1/125, 16mm, Wide-angle\nMarrakech, Jemaa el-Fnaa, Street market, Cultural scene, Twilight, Mixed light, Diagonal lines, Panasonic Lumix S1R, 50mm f/1.4, f/2.8, 800, 1/100, 50mm, Street\nRome, Colosseum, Ancient ruins, Cityscape, Evening, Blue hour, Rule of thirds, Sony A1, 14-24mm f/2.8, f/5.6, 400, 1/50, 14mm, Wide-angle\nCape Town, Table Mountain, Beach, Coastal landscape, Sunset, Golden hour, Negative space, Nikon D780, 24-120mm f/4, f/8, 100, 1/200, 35mm, Landscape"}, {"Prompt Length": 766, "Output Length": 22, "prompt": "Thank you!

Introduction\nIn England's countryside, there lived a young lass,\nWhose parents had passed, leaving her alone in a vast,\nEstate owned by her uncle, a man so austere,\nWho had no time for her, nor care to appear.\n\nMary was her name, and she felt quite alone,\nNo friends to play with, no one to call her own,\nBut one day while exploring, she found a surprise,\nA secret garden, hidden away from prying eyes.\n\n1. Discovery of the Garden\nThe garden was locked up, with a rusted old key,\nBut Mary was curious, she wanted to see,\nWhat was inside that garden, what lay beyond,\nSo she searched high and low, till she found the bond.\n\nAs she walked through the garden, she felt a strange thrill,\nSeeing flowers and trees that had been silent and still,\nFor years they had slept, but now they awoke,\nAnd Mary felt a stirring, a strange, joyous poke.\n\n1. Friendship with Dickon\nSoon, Mary met a boy, a farmer's son,\nHis name was Dickon, he was full of fun,\nHe showed her the ways of the garden, and how,\nTo plant, water, and care for each flower and bough.\n\nTogether they worked, till the garden was bright,\nWith colors so vivid, a truly wonderful sight,\nMary had found a friend, one that was true,\nSomeone who helped her, when she was feeling blue.\n\n1. The Transformation of the Garden\nOver time, the garden transformed, bloomed, and grew,\nMary and Dickon had done it, they knew what to do,\nThe garden was alive, with sounds and scents so rare,\nA place that was magical, beyond compare.\n\nThe garden became a symbol, of hope and of love,\nFor those who were hurting, who felt lost, who needed a shove,\nIt reminded them that with effort and care,\nThey too could grow something, that was lovely and fair.\n\n1. Conclusion\nMary had found something, beyond wealth or fame,\nA garden that grew, a friendship that came,\nFrom working together, and never giving up,\nEven when things seemed hard, like an empty cup.\n\nThe garden taught her, the value of life,\nAnd how even in sorrow, there's a chance to thrive,\nMary's journey was a lesson, for young and old,\nAbout the power of friendship, and the beauty that's told.\n\nMoral of the Story:\nThrough Mary's journey, we learn that friendship is key,\nTo growth, transformation, and living life fully,\nWith hard work and perseverance, anything's

The endpoint writes the request data to a temporary file, calls the Python script with the file path as an argument using a subprocess, and waits for the subprocess to complete. After the subprocess completes, the response data is read from a file that the Python script writes to, and the file is deleted. The response data is returned in the response body.\n\nThe Python script reads the request data from the file specified in the command line arguments and executes the service logic to generate the response data. It then calls a webhook in the Spring Boot application at the endpoint `/python-service-response` with the response data as the payload.

We use the `data` event of the first response to detect the end of the `<head>` section, then split the chunk into two parts: the `<head>` section and the rest of the HTML. We enqueue the `<head>` section and start streaming the rest of the HTML from the second response. We use a boolean variable `headDone` to keep track of whether we have already processed the `<head>` section.

The pitch identifies a favorable societal and regulatory context, which is crucial for any new venture to succeed (Gartner, 1988). Moreover, the pitch highlights a clear market and customer needs, providing a compelling value proposition that resonates with potential customers (Kuratko et al., 2015). However, the pitch also presents some weaknesses that must be addressed to enhance its potential for success.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the pitch is its alignment with the demographic shift in the population, which creates a favorable window of opportunity for the venture (Eisenman, 2013). By leveraging this trend, the founders can position Helpmates as a valuable service that addresses the unmet needs of an aging population. The pitch also demonstrates a strong understanding of the target market, which is crucial for identifying and addressing customer needs effectively (Zhao & Seibert, 2006). This understanding is reflected in the pitch's articulation of a clear value proposition that appeals to customers who are willing to pay for the services offered.\n\nDespite these strengths, the pitch falls short in several areas. First, the competitive dynamics of the industry are not adequately addressed, raising concerns about the venture's ability to differentiate itself from established players (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994). To mitigate this weakness, the founders should conduct a thorough competitive analysis, identifying potential threats and opportunities, and develop strategies to differentiate their offering (Markman & Baron, 2003).\n\nSecond, the financial strength of the opportunity remains unclear due to a lack of detailed information on revenue projections, cost structures, and funding plans (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Providing a comprehensive financial plan can help the founders make informed decisions about the venture's growth and development, and it can also instill confidence in potential investors. Further, a robust financial plan demonstrates the founders' understanding of the economic aspects of their venture, which is vital for its success (Garvin & Levesque, 2006).\n\nThird, the pitch's implementation plan appears overly optimistic, with limited attention paid to potential challenges and risks. The founders should develop a more detailed and realistic implementation plan that incorporates strategies for managing risks and overcoming the liabilities of newness and size (Moroz & Hindle, 2012). This plan should be grounded in evidence-based approaches and informed by relevant theories and frameworks, such as design thinking (Brown & Wyatt, 2010), lean startup principles (Review et al., 2018), and strategic renewal strategies (Binns et al., 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the Helpmates venture pitch presents several key strengths, including a favorable business context, a clear understanding of the target market, and a compelling value proposition. However, weaknesses related to competitive dynamics, financial strength, and implementation must be addressed for the venture to succeed. By incorporating relevant theories and frameworks, the founders can enhance their pitch and increase the likelihood of their venture's success.\n\nWord Count: 498 (excluding reference list)"}, {"Prompt Length": 767, "Output Length": 24, "prompt": "Yes, there are a few ways to optimize the script in terms of performance.

First, we define two lists: `chunk_sizes` contains the sizes of the chunks we want to create, including the sample sizes, and `sample_sizes` contains the sample sizes we want to use.\n2. We also define a list `sample_file_suffixes` that contains the suffixes to use for the sample chunk file names.\n3. We read in the CSV file using `csv.reader` and add each value to a set called `data`. This ensures that we have a unique set of values, and it also allows us to use the set method `difference_update` to remove values from the set as we generate sample and remaining chunks.\n4. For each sample size in `sample_sizes`, we create a sample of that size using the `random.sample` function and store it in a set called `sample`. We then use `difference_update` to remove the sample values from `data`.\n5. We write the sample to a JSON file with a file name based on the original CSV file name and the corresponding suffix from `sample_file_suffixes`.\n6. For each remaining chunk size in `chunk_sizes`, we create a chunk of that size using the `random.sample` function if the chunk size is less than 10000 (i.e., if it's a sample chunk), or we use the full `data` set if the chunk size is 10000 (i.e., if it's a remaining chunk).\n7. We use `difference_update` to remove the chunk values from `data`.\n8. We write the chunk to a JSON file with a file name based on the original CSV file name and the chunk number."}, {"Prompt Length": 609, "Output Length": 32, "prompt": "Erasure coding is a method of data protection and fault tolerance that involves breaking data into smaller pieces, adding redundant information, and distributing the data fragments across multiple storage locations. It is widely used in distributed systems, such as cloud storage, data centers, and in the case of Celestia, distributed blockchain networks. The primary goal of erasure coding is to ensure data reliability and availability even in the face of storage failures or data loss.\n\nHere's an in-depth description of erasure coding:\n\n1. Data Fragmentation: The original data is divided into smaller pieces, called data fragments or data shards. Each fragment contains a portion of the original data.\n2. Redundancy: Redundant fragments, called parity shards, are created by applying an algorithm, such as Reed-Solomon coding or another erasure coding scheme. Parity shards are generated using mathematical transformations or encoding functions that combine the original data shards. The number of parity shards depends on the desired level of fault tolerance and redundancy.\n3. Distribution: Both data shards and parity shards are distributed across multiple storage locations (e.g., storage nodes or disks). This distribution ensures that the data is spread across the system, reducing the impact of any single point of failure.\n4. Recovery: When data needs to be retrieved or reconstructed, a subset of the original data shards and parity shards is used. The recovery process involves decoding the available shards to regenerate the original data. As long as a sufficient number of shards (data shards and/or parity shards) are available, the original data can be reconstructed even if some of the storage locations have failed or become unavailable.\n5. Fault Tolerance: The level of fault tolerance provided by erasure coding depends on the ratio of data shards to parity shards. More parity shards result in greater fault tolerance, but at the cost of increased storage overhead. For example, with an erasure coding scheme that uses 10 data shards and 4 parity shards (often denoted as 10+4), the system can tolerate up to 4 storage failures or unavailable shards while still being able to recover the original data.\n\nErasure coding provides several benefits over traditional data replication methods, such as RAID or mirroring:\n\n* Storage Efficiency: Erasure coding generally requires less storage overhead than full replication while still providing a high level of fault tolerance.\n* Scalability: Erasure coding can be easily scaled to support large distributed systems, making it suitable for cloud storage, distributed file systems, and blockchain networks.\n* Reliability: By spreading data and parity shards across multiple storage locations, erasure coding reduces the likelihood of data loss or unavailability due to localized failures or storage issues.\n\nIn the context of Celestia, erasure coding is used to ensure data availability and fault tolerance for the transaction data submitted by rollups. By encoding and distributing the data across the network, Celestia can guarantee that the data is accessible and resilient to censorship or unavailability attacks, enabling secure and efficient data availability for rollups and other decentralized applications."}, {"Prompt Length": 555, "Output Length": 21, "prompt": "To save the request data to the database in Step 2, you can use the JdbcTemplate or JPA to execute an insert query.\n\nFirst, you will need to create a Java object to represent the request data. You can use the @Entity and @Column annotations to map the fields of the object to the columns of the database table.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"request_data\")\npublic class RequestData {\n\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n  private Long id;\n\n  @Column(name = \"processor_id\")\n  private String processorId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"issuer_id\")\n  private String issuerId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"transaction_id\")\n  private String transactionId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"stepup_request_id\")\n  private String stepupRequestId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"device_locale\")\n  private String deviceLocale;\n\n  @Column(name = \"device_user_agent\")\n  private String deviceUserAgent;\n\n  @Column(name = \"message_version\")\n  private String messageVersion;\n\n  @Column(name = \"rdx_message_version\")\n  private String rdxMessageVersion;\n\n  @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n  @JoinColumn(name = \"payment_info_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\")\n  private PaymentInfo paymentInfo;\n\n  // Getters and setters\n}\n```\nNext, you can create a repository interface to handle the database operations. For example:\n```\npublic interface RequestDataRepository extends JpaRepository<RequestData, Long> {\n}\n```\nFinally, you can inject the RequestDataRepository bean into your API controller and use it to save the request data to the database.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@RestController\npublic class MyApiController {\n\n  @Autowired\n  private RequestDataRepository requestDataRepository;\n\n  @PostMapping(\"/api/request\")\n  public ResponseEntity<Object> processRequest(@RequestBody MyRequest request) {\n    // Step 02: Save the request to the database with status = 1\n    RequestData requestData = new RequestData();\n    requestData.setProcessorId(request.getProcessorId());\n    requestData.setIssuerId(request.getIssuerId());\n    requestData.setTransactionId(request.getTransactionId());\n    requestData.setStepupRequestId(request.getStepupRequestId());\n    requestData.setDeviceLocale(request.getDeviceLocale());\n    requestData.setDeviceUserAgent(request.getDeviceUserAgent());\n    requestData.setMessageVersion(request.getMessageVersion());\n    requestData.setRdxMessageVersion(request.getRdxMessageVersion());\n    requestData.setPaymentInfo(request.getPaymentInfo());\n    requestData.setStatus(1); // status = 1 indicates that the request has been received\n    requestDataRepository.save(requestData);\n  }\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!

The `node` command is used to add the angle label at the midpoint of the arc, using the `above right` option to position the label above and to the right of the arc, and the `midway` option to position the label at the midpoint of the arc.

You know what they say, when you gotta sneeze, you gotta sneeze!\"\n\nPhil's wife, who had unknowingly asked for extra pepper on her food, looked up from her plate and apologized. \"Oh, Jack, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize it would set off your allergies.\"\n\nJack's face was contorted with the effort of trying to hold back the sneeze. His eyes were watering, his nose was red, and his cheeks were puffed out. But he still tried to downplay it. \"It's no big deal, really. I've got this under control.\"\n\nPhil, however, was having none of it. \"Oh, Jack, you always do yourself a disservice. You've got the biggest sneezes of any man I know. Just let 'er rip!\"\n\nAnd with that, Jack's resolve crumbled. He let out an enormous sneeze that shook the very foundations of the hall. Plates clattered, glasses shattered, and guests shrieked in surprise. And just as everyone was recovering from the shock of that first sneeze, Jack felt another one coming on.\n\n\"Oh no,\" he muttered, but Phil was already beside him, egging him on.\n\n\"Come on, Jack, don't be shy. Give us another one!\"\n\nAnd so Jack let loose with another massive sneeze, this one even bigger than the first. The chandeliers swayed, the walls creaked, and the guests rushed for the exits. In no time at all, the once-grand banquet hall was empty and in ruins, with Jack standing in the middle of the chaos, still feeling the urge to sneeze.\n\nPhil, however, was unfazed. He clapped Jack on the back, laughing. \"You always were a showstopper, Jack. I couldn't be more proud.\""}, {"Prompt Length": 815, "Output Length": 24, "prompt": "Sure!

This action plan will guide students, particularly those with reading levels ranging from K-5th grade, to complete the research process effectively. This action plan uses the Big6 research process, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. Task Definition: Defining the task and identifying the questions that need to be answered.\n2. Information Seeking Strategies: Determining the sources of information needed to answer the questions.\n3. Location and Access: Finding the sources identified in step 2.\n4. Use of Information: Evaluating and extracting information from sources.\n5. Synthesis: Organizing information from different sources.\n6. Virtual Field Trips: Exploring museums virtually.\n7. Evaluation: Assessing the completed task.\n\nHere's how students can complete each step of the research process:\n\n1. Task Definition:\nAs a class, create a mind map on the board that lists all the museums students know of. Encourage students to think of museums in their town or city, as well as nationally or internationally known museums. From there, students will select a museum to research.\nMisconceptions: Students may not understand the difference between types of museums, such as art museums and science museums.\n2. Information Seeking Strategies:\nAfter selecting a museum to research, students will identify the questions they need to answer to complete their research. They will use the Destiny catalog on the PGCMLS site to locate print and digital materials, such as books and online resources, to gather information. Additionally, students can use databases like WorldBook, CultureGrams, and Encyclopaedia Britannica to find information.\nMisconceptions: Students may struggle to identify questions to ask or to identify relevant keywords to use in their research.\n3. Location and Access:\nStudents will use the resources found in step 2 to research their museum. They will take notes and record their sources.\nMisconceptions: Students may not understand how to access the information they have found.\n4. Use of Information:\nStudents will analyze and evaluate the information they have found to determine if it answers their research questions. They will take notes and record the information they found.\nMisconceptions: Students may not know how to evaluate information to determine if it is reliable or accurate.\n5. Synthesis:\nStudents will organize their notes and information into categories, such as exhibits, history, or famous artifacts. They will then write a report or create a presentation.\nMisconceptions: Students may struggle to organize their notes and information effectively.\n6. Virtual Field Trips:\nTo give students a more immersive experience, they can explore the museum virtually through websites like Google Culture, and virtual tours offered on the museum website. Additionally, students can visit museums through virtual field trips offered on sites like PebbleGo.\nMisconceptions: Students may think that virtual tours are the same as visiting a museum in person.\n7. Evaluation:\nFinally, students will evaluate their work to determine if they have met their research goals. They will assess their sources for accuracy and relevance, and determine if their final product effectively communicates what they have learned.\nMisconceptions: Students may not know how to evaluate their work effectively or may not be aware of their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn conclusion, by following this action plan and using the Big6 research process, 4th-grade students can complete their museum research project with greater success. This will also help students develop important research and critical thinking skills that they will be able"}, {"Prompt Length": 701, "Output Length": 98, "prompt": "43-46: Answer these questions according to the\npassage below:\n\nThe question of animal language and thought has been\ndebated since ancient times. Some have held the\nview that humans are exceptional in these respects,\nwhile others believe that humans and animals are\nsimilar with respect to language and thought. The issue\nis important because our self-image as a species is at\nstake. Arguments for human exceptionalism such as\nCartesian, Wittgensteinian and behaviourist state that\nlanguage and thought are closely associated, and\nanimals do not have language. The ape language\nexperiments of the 1960s and 1970s were especially\nimportant against this background: if apes could learn\nlanguage then even the advocates of human\nexceptionalism would have to admit that they have\nthoughts. It is now generally believed that whatever\nlinguistic abilities apes have shown have been quite\nrudimentary. Yet many sceptics are willing to grant that\nin some cases apes did develop linguistic skills to some\nextent, and clearly evidenced thought.

Yes, basically, the Tiamat field caused USA and Canada to become third world countries overnight, and to lose massive amounts of population to sudden death caused by the immediate EMP ( crashes, hospital deaths etc. ), and then to mass migration, food shortages in the cities etc. So the US and Canadian governments still exist, but their influence is very limited in the remaining cities which weren't immediately ruined by the EMP. Alaska has formed its own government which only nominally continues the USA sovereignty, but in the subsequent elections, the ruling parties in Alaska are anti-migration, and mostly ( de facto ) fascist. The wave of almost 250 million refugees and migrants from USA has caused the government of Mexico to fall, and the local militias to form their own independent governments which are basically all fascist and ruthless towards migrants from the USA. The rest of Latin America has suffered from these events economically, so there was a domino effect, and most of the governments have become fascist or totalitarian. \n\nEuropean countries have also gone to extremes because of the large influx of refugees, and the countries which most relied on USA for economy had suffered massive economic crisis ( Ireland, UK, Germany etc. help me with some data pls ). Russia has become a more central player during these events, but with the outside pressure of USA faltering, the local Russian politicians have become more ambitious and disunited ( without a strong enemy, there was no need for a one strong leader in Russia ), so this caused Russia and many ex-USSR countries to become semi-independent from Moscow. Japan had also suffered economically, so China quickly took over Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam ( only nominally leaving them as a sovereign nations ). \nBased on your outline, it's clear that the Tiamat event has had profound global consequences, leading to a shift in power dynamics and the rise of extremist governments. Here are some additional details and world-building elements to consider:\n\nEconomic Impact on European Countries: The sudden collapse of the US and Canadian economies would have had a ripple effect on their trading partners. Countries with strong economic ties to the US and Canada, like the UK, Germany, and Ireland, would have experienced severe financial crises. This could result in high unemployment rates, currency devaluation, and increased poverty.\n\nOther European countries might also experience similar issues, with some nations becoming more isolationist or nationalist in response to the crisis. The European Union could struggle to maintain unity among its member states, and its influence might wane as individual countries focus on their own interests and survival.\n\nAfrican and Middle Eastern Countries: The shift in global power dynamics could lead to increased instability in Africa and the Middle East. As the US and other Western powers lose their influence, regional powers may rise and compete for dominance. This could lead to new alliances, rivalries, and conflicts over resources and territory.\n\nIndia and Southeast Asia: The power vacuum created by the collapse of the US and the rise of China could also impact India and Southeast Asia. India might assert itself as a regional power to counterbalance China's growing influence, leading to increased tensions and potential conflicts between the two nations. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore could experience political and economic turmoil as they navigate the new geopolitical landscape.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand: Given their geographic isolation, Australia and New Zealand might fare better than other nations in terms of political stability. However, they would still be affected by the global economic downturn and would need to forge new alliances and trade partnerships to maintain their prosperity.\n\nClimate Change and Environmental Issues: With the chaos and upheaval caused by the Tiamat event, global efforts to address climate change and other environmental issues could be severely hampered. This might lead to worsening environmental conditions and more frequent natural disasters, further compounding the challenges faced by the survivors of the Tiamat event.\n\nThese additional details and considerations can help you further develop your post-apocalyptic world, highlighting the complex global consequences of the Tiamat event and creating a rich, immersive setting for your novel.\n\n\nPetar B\n8. inside the Tiamat field, the nature took over cities and human settlements. Animals are unaffected by the field, and many humans survived / returned to the zone, basically living without electricity, sort of like the Amish, or people in the XIX century. But these agricultural settlements are often attacked by the technologically advanced polities from the east and west coast and former Mexico. There are also raiders who live inside the tiamat field, using whatever weapons they can use, older cars ( which are less reliable, as the field seems to mess with sparkplugs ). After almost a century of this field's existence, the animals have multiplied, the forests are thick and the temperature inside the zone had fallen a few degrees. Unpredictable storms often hit the area, and earthquakes are much more common, even in the coastal areas unaffected by the EMP blast. The Tiamat entity also seems to attract tides, so the sea levels have risen in the coastal areas, and the surviving cities suffer greatly, and are often flooded, so they are slowly faltering.\nThe Tiamat field has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the environment and the people living within and around it. Here are some elements to consider based on the changes you've described:\n\nFlora: As nature reclaims the areas within the Tiamat field, forests and vegetation become denser, and previously cultivated land returns to its wild state. This could lead to the emergence of new plant species or the resurgence of native plants that had been previously displaced by human activity.\n\nFauna: The absence of humans and the proliferation of plant life would lead to an increase in animal populations within the Tiamat field. This might result in the resurgence of previously endangered species and the emergence of new or mutated species adapted to the altered environment. There could also be an increase in predator populations due to the abundance of prey.\n\nHuman settlements: The communities living within the Tiamat field would be forced to adapt to a pre-electric lifestyle, relying on traditional farming techniques, animal labor, and manual craftsmanship. They would need to develop new ways to defend themselves against attacks from technologically advanced polities and raiders, perhaps using ingenious low-tech solutions, traps, or guerrilla tactics.\n\nWeather patterns and natural disasters: The unpredictable storms, increased frequency of earthquakes, and altered tides caused by the Tiamat field would pose significant challenges for the people living in and around the affected areas. These communities might develop unique architectural solutions, such as stilt houses, floating structures, or buildings designed to withstand earthquakes and floods. They might also rely on traditional methods of predicting weather patterns and coping with natural disasters.\n\nSea level rise and coastal cities: As the Tiamat entity causes tides to rise and coastal areas to flood, the surviving cities would face increasing challenges to their infrastructure and resources. They might invest in building sea walls, levees, and other flood mitigation measures, or they might resort to relocating further inland as the situation becomes untenable. These cities would also need to adapt to a world with limited resources and unstable trade networks, making them more self-reliant and resourceful.\n\nConsidering these factors will help you develop a rich, detailed world that reflects the long-term effects of the Tiamat field on the environment and its inhabitants."}, {"Prompt Length": 635, "Output Length": 76, "prompt": "In this scenario, the Seven Dwarfs could be replaced by a group of Snow White's colleagues who become her close friends and allies. Here is a revised version of the scenario with the Seven Dwarfs as Snow White's colleagues:\n\nSnow White is a brilliant and ambitious software engineer who works for a large IT company. She is known for her technical expertise and her ability to solve complex problems. One day, while working late at the office, Snow White meets a handsome and charming new employee named Prince Charming. He is a talented programmer who has just joined the company, and he is immediately drawn to Snow White's intelligence and beauty.\n\nDespite their differences in social status - Snow White is a lower-level employee, while Prince Charming is the son of the CEO - they become fast friends. They work together on a number of projects and discover that they have a lot in common. They both love technology and enjoy spending time in front of their computers. They also both have a love for music and poetry.\n\nSnow White also becomes close friends with a group of her colleagues, who are affectionately known as the Seven Dwarfs. There is Dopey, who is a funny and lovable junior programmer; Bashful, who is a shy and introverted designer; Grumpy, who is a cantankerous but brilliant data scientist; Sleepy, who is a laid-back and easy-going tester; Sneezy, who is a sensitive and empathetic project manager; and Happy, who is a cheerful and optimistic DevOps engineer. Together, they form a tight-knit and supportive team.\n\nHowever, the Evil Queen, who is the CEO of the company and Prince Charming's stepmother, is jealous of Snow White's talent and plots to kill her. She disguises herself as a friendly colleague and offers Snow White a poisoned coffee, hoping that she will drink it and fall into a deep sleep. But Snow White, being cautious and wise, recognizes the Evil Queen's trick and refuses to drink the coffee.\n\nInstead, Snow White turns the tables on the Evil Queen and confronts her, saying: \"I know who you are, Evil Queen. You are jealous of my talent, but it is not my talent that makes me special. It is my hard work, my dedication, and my determination. These are the qualities that truly make a person successful, and they are qualities that you will never have.\"\n\nThe Evil Queen, enraged by Snow White's words, attacks her with a letter opener, but Snow White is able to defend herself with her quick reflexes and agility. She fights back and defeats the Evil Queen, saving Prince Charming and the company from her tyranny.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs are impressed by Snow White's bravery and strength, and they pledge their loyalty to her. Together, they work to rebuild the company and make it a better place for all employees.\n\nIn the end, Snow White and Prince Charming get married and live happily ever after, ruling the company with wisdom and justice.

They had been working hard for weeks, building a new office complex in the heart of the city, and were in dire need of a break. So, they decided to explore the local cafe scene and try some of the delicious food that Europe was famous for.\n\nAs they walked into the quaint cafe, they were greeted by the warm, inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee and delicious pastries. They chose a small table in the corner, and Jack ordered a cappuccino while Phil went for a latte. They were just settling in and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere when they noticed a woman, Lyonne, at a nearby table.\n\nLyonne was a striking woman, with dark hair and bright, sparkling eyes. She was a vivacious woman, and Jack couldn't help but be drawn to her energy. But as she began to eat, she added a generous amount of cracked pepper to her dish, and Jack felt a tickle in his nose.\n\nPhil noticed Jack's discomfort and knew exactly what was happening. \"Jack, I think you're going to need to get out of here soon,\" he whispered. \"I can smell the pepper from here.\"\n\nJack tried to hold back his sneeze, but it was no use. The tickle in his nose was growing stronger by the second. He looked around the cafe, trying to find a way out, but the door was too far away. He knew he was going to sneeze, and he knew it was going to be a big one.\n\nPhil could see the panic in Jack's eyes and knew he had to act fast. He jumped up from his chair, \"Come on, Jack, let's get out of here,\" he said, grabbing Jack's arm and pulling him towards the door.\n\nBut it was too late. Jack let out a huge sneeze, and the entire cafe shook. The windows rattled, and the coffee cups on the tables trembled.

Here's an example of how the underlying relationship issues could play out in the context of a relationship between two people:\n\nCase Study:\n\nJohn is a 36-year-old male from Ireland with ADHD, and his partner, Anna, is a 28-year-old German woman with ADHD. Anna is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Behavioral Economics with a view to completing a PhD and eventually finding work on the job market. John has spent much of his life pursuing a career in music, but has struggled to get off the ground and has since developed a successful career in conceptual design, which allows him to be financially stable and pursue his passion for creating music in his free time.\n\nCommunication problems:\n\nJohn and Anna have struggled with communication issues in their relationship. John often feels that Anna is not fully present when they talk, and that she is distracted by her studies or other obligations. Anna, in turn, feels that John can be too intense and demanding in their conversations, and that he does not always listen to her needs and concerns.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on improving their communication skills by setting aside dedicated time for conversations, actively listening to each other, and expressing themselves clearly and effectively. They may also benefit from learning to respond with empathy and understanding, and making an effort to focus on each other's needs and concerns during their conversations.\n\nTrust issues:\n\nJohn has struggled with trust issues in the relationship, due in part to past experiences of being betrayed by previous partners. He sometimes feels suspicious of Anna's interactions with other men, and has difficulty trusting that she is fully committed to their relationship.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on rebuilding trust by being open and transparent with each other, avoiding behaviors that may trigger mistrust, and making a commitment to honesty and integrity. They may also benefit from discussing their fears and concerns in a safe and supportive environment, and working to find ways to build trust and strengthen their connection.\n\nPower struggles:\n\nJohn and Anna have also struggled with power struggles in their relationship. John sometimes feels that Anna is not supportive enough of his musical ambitions, and that she does not fully understand his needs and priorities. Anna, in turn, feels that John can be too demanding and controlling at times, and that he does not always listen to her needs and concerns.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work to address power imbalances by actively listening to each other's needs and concerns, setting clear boundaries, and working to make decisions collaboratively. They may also benefit from exploring any underlying fears or insecurities that may be driving power struggles, and finding ways to build a more equal and supportive relationship.\n\nExternal pressures:\n\nBoth John and Anna are dealing with external stressors in their lives. John is trying to balance his day job as a product design consultant with his passion for music, and Anna is under pressure to complete her Master's degree and prepare for her future career.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on managing external stressors by supporting each other and finding ways to prioritize their relationship in the midst of competing demands. They may also benefit from setting aside dedicated time for each other and engaging in stress-reducing activities together, such as exercise, mindfulness, or other self-care practices.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBy working to address these underlying relationship issues, John and Anna could develop a stronger and more fulfilling relationship. They could also benefit from seeking the support of a couples therapist, who could provide them with guidance and support as they work to strengthen their connection and build a more balanced and sustainable partnership."}, {"Prompt Length": 744, "Output Length": 86, "prompt": "Certainly! Here is a more detailed version of the champion concept, including information about the abilities' scaling, cooldowns, and mana costs:\n\nName: Klutzy\n\nAppearance: Klutzy is a clumsy, gangly humanoid with oversized feet and a propensity for tripping over his own two feet. He has a lovable, goofy expression on his face and wears a pair of oversized glasses to help him see. He also wears a pair of oversized boots with extra cushioning to protect his ankles from the frequent falls he takes.\n\nRole: Klutzy is a clumsy, yet lovable support champion who excels at providing utility and protection for his allies.\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive - Clumsy: Klutzy has a 10% chance to trip and fall whenever he takes damage from an enemy champion, causing him to become briefly slowed and vulnerable for 1.5 seconds. However, this also causes him to drop a trail of helpful items, such as health potions, gold coins, and wards, for his allies to pick up. The number of items dropped increases with Klutzy's level.\n\nQ - Fumble: Klutzy throws a clumsy punch at an enemy, dealing 60/80/100/120/140 (+0.6 bonus attack damage) physical damage and briefly slowing them by 20% for 1 second. If the punch misses, Klutzy has a 20% chance to stumble and fall, causing him to become slowed and unable to attack for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds\n\nMana cost: 50/55/60/65/70\n\nW - Wild Swings: Klutzy becomes nearsighted and begins swinging his arms wildly, dealing 50/70/90/110/130 (+0.4 bonus attack damage) physical damage to all enemies within a small radius. While using this ability, Klutzy's movement speed is increased by 125 for the duration.\n\nDuration: 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds\n\nCooldown: 18/16/14/12/10 seconds\n\nMana cost: 70/80/90/100/110\n\nE - Slip n' Slide: Klutzy charges forward, sliding across the ground and leaving a slick surface behind him. Enemy champions who are caught in the slick surface have a 20% chance to slip and fall, becoming slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds\n\nMana cost: 60/65/70/75/80\n\nR - Pratfall: Klutzy takes a massive stumble, causing him to fall to the ground and become slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds. However, this also creates a large shockwave that knocks up and slows all enemy champions in a large radius by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 120/110/100 seconds\n\nMana cost: 100/110/120\n\nOverall, Klutzy is a clumsy, yet lovable champion who excels at providing utility and protection for his allies.

This implementation covers most of the constructs mentioned. However, due to the size and complexity of the task, some aspects such as error handling and reporting are simplified. You can extend and improve the parser as needed.\n```rust\nuse std::iter::Peekable;\nuse std::str::Chars;\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\npub enum ParseError {\n    UnexpectedToken(char),\n    UnexpectedEof,\n}\n\ntype ParseResult<T> = Result<T, ParseError>;\n\npub struct Parser<'a> {\n    input: Peekable<Chars<'a>>,\n}\n\nimpl<'a> Parser<'a> {\n    pub fn new(input: &'a str) -> Self {\n        Parser {\n            input: input.chars().peekable(),\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn next_char(&mut self) -> Option<char> {\n        self.input.next()\n    }\n\n    fn peek_char(&mut self) -> Option<&char> {\n        self.input.peek()\n    }\n\n    // Parsing functions for literals\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for identifiers\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for operators\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for expressions\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for control structures\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for function and class definitions\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for function calls\n    // ...\n\n    // Parsing functions for modules and imports\n    // ...\n\n    pub fn parse_program(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Program> {\n        let mut program = vec![];\n        while let Some(_) = self.peek_char() {\n            let stmt = self.parse_statement()?;\n            program.push(stmt);\n        }\n        Ok(program)\n    }\n}\n\npub fn parse(input: &str) -> ParseResult<Program> {\n    let mut parser = Parser::new(input);\n    parser.parse_program()\n}\n```\nThis basic parser implementation defines a `Parser` struct that wraps the input string and provides helper methods for parsing different language constructs. The `ParseError` enum represents various types of parse errors that may occur.\n\nFor each language construct, you'll need to implement parsing functions that consume input characters and construct the corresponding AST nodes. Due to space constraints, I have not provided implementations for all parsing functions here.\n\nFor example, you could implement parsing functions for literals like this:\n```rust\nfn parse_number(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn parse_string(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn parse_boolean(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nSimilarly, you'll need to implement parsing functions for other constructs like identifiers, operators, expressions, control structures, function and class definitions, function calls, and modules and imports.\n\nTo handle and report syntax errors, you can use the `ParseError` enum and return a `ParseResult` from each parsing function. You can improve the error handling and reporting by including more context, such as line and column numbers, and more specific error messages.\n\nFinally, the `parse_program` method serves as the parser entry point, parsing the entire LMLang source code into an AST. The `parse` function is provided as a convenient top-level function for parsing LMLang source code.\n\nKeep in mind that this basic implementation should be extended and improved to cover the entire LMLang syntax, handle error reporting better, and ensure correct precedence and associativity for operators."}, {"Prompt Length": 627, "Output Length": 98, "prompt": "You're correct.

Two middle-aged Englishmen were responsible for packing the mirror for shipment. One of them was all business, while the other liked to talk. As they worked, the talkative man commented on the beauty of the mirror, and the other man replied, \"It's just a mirror, mate. Let's just pack it up and send it on its way.\"\n\nTwo decades later, the mirror was discovered in a storeroom of a New York museum. The employees who found it were surprised to learn that the museum had owned the mirror for many years, and yet it had never been put on display. \"It's not really art, is it?\" one of the employees remarked. \"It's just a mirror.\" But even though it was not considered art, the mirror seemed to draw people to it.\n\nThe employees were curious about the mirror's origin, and they discussed its history in hushed tones. They knew that it had come from England, but beyond that, they knew very little. \"I heard that the person who owned it claimed it could show you an alternate future,\" one of the employees said. \"Can you imagine? Seeing what might have been?\"\n\nAnother employee chimed in, \"I heard that it was cursed, that anyone who looked into it would be trapped there forever. But I don't believe in that sort of thing.\" The employees all laughed nervously, but they couldn't deny the magnetic pull of the mirror.\n\nOne of the employees, a middle-aged woman named Anne, was particularly intrigued by the mirror. Her son, a teenage boy, would often come to the museum after school to wait for her to finish her shift. Anne noticed that her son would often sit in front of the mirror, staring at his reflection for long periods of time. She didn't understand why he found the mirror so compelling, but she couldn't deny its power.\n\nAs the days passed, the mirror seemed to exert an increasingly strong hold on the boy. Anne began to worry about his mental health and wondered if the mirror was somehow causing him harm. She decided to do some research on the mirror's history and was shocked by what she found.\n\nThe mirror had a long and dark past, dating back centuries to medieval Europe. There were stories of people becoming obsessed with the mirror, of seeing their own reflection twisted and distorted until it drove them mad. Some people claimed that the mirror was cursed, that it had the power to show people a version of reality that was not meant to be seen.\n\nAnne became convinced that the mirror was the cause of her son's strange behavior. She begged her supervisors to remove the mirror from the museum, but they refused, claiming that it was a valuable artifact with an important history. Anne knew that she had to take matters into her own hands.\n\nOne day, when the museum was closed, Anne snuck into the storage room where the mirror was kept. She wrapped it in a thick blanket and began to carry it out of the museum. As she was leaving, she ran into one of the security guards. He asked her what she was doing, and she replied, \"I'm taking the mirror home. It doesn't belong here.\"\n\nThe security guard tried to stop her, but Anne was determined. She carried the mirror out of the museum and into the night, never looking back.

We will provide services related to talent acquisition, competency evaluation, and personalized training to these businesses at a premium price.\n\nIn addition to B2B, we also have a B2C revenue model through our participation in the K-digital Training project, which is a government-backed initiative to train the next generation of digital workers. Through this program, we offer intensive bootcamps and other courses to individuals at a lower cost, with the goal of increasing the pool of talented workers available to the industry.\n\nWe also plan to monetize our data through partnerships with other companies and organizations in the talent development industry. By providing access to our large and diverse pool of student data, we can help other businesses improve their talent transformation processes and provide more personalized and effective training to their own employees.\n\n2-a) Market size\n\nTo estimate the market size for our talent transformation platform, we must consider both the global adult education market and the job market. According to market research firm HolonIQ, the global market for education and training is estimated to be worth $7 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, the global job market is expected to grow to 3.5 billion workers by 2030, with an increasing demand for workers with digital skills.\n\nAssuming that our talent transformation platform can capture just 1% of the global market for education and training, and assuming an average cost of $5,000 per student, our potential revenue could reach $35 billion. However, given our focus on B2B and our unique capabilities in talent transformation, we believe we have the potential to capture a larger share of the market and generate even more revenue.\n\n2-b-i) Status, pros and cons of other players in the market\n\nWhen it comes to talent development and incubation, there are a number of players in the market, ranging from global educational platforms to career transformation platforms like LinkedIn. Some of the key players in the market include:\n\n* Udacity: A leading online education platform with a focus on tech skills and digital transformation. Udacity offers a variety of programs and courses designed to upskill workers and prepare them for the jobs of the future.\n* Coursera: Another popular online education platform that offers a wide range of courses and programs in various fields. Coursera partners with universities and companies to provide high-quality education to learners around the world.\n* LinkedIn: A career-focused social media platform that offers a variety of tools and resources for job seekers and professionals. LinkedIn also provides learning opportunities and certification programs to help workers upskill and stay competitive in the job market.\n\nEach of these players has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Udacity has a strong focus on tech skills and digital transformation, but may not have the same level of experience and expertise in talent development as Codestates. Coursera has a wide range of courses and partnerships, but may not have the same level of customization and personalization as Codestates. LinkedIn has a large and active user base, but may not have the same level of in-depth training and evaluation as Codestates.\n\n2-b-ii) Competitive advantage of Codestates\n\nCodestates has a number of competitive advantages in the talent development and incubation market, including:\n\n* Unique student data: Codestates has been collecting student data for many years, which provides a wealth of insights into the competencies and potential of digital workers. This data can be used to develop more accurate and effective competency evaluation models, as well as personalized training programs.\n* Personalized education curriculum: Codestates offers a wide variety of modularized contents that can be"}, {"Prompt Length": 753, "Output Length": 129, "prompt": "Document\n @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900&display=swap');\n \\*{\n margin: 0;\n padding: 0;\n box-sizing: border-box;\n font-family: 'Poppins',sans-serif;\n }\n body {\n display: flex;\n justify-content: flex-end;\n align-items: flex-end;\n min-height: 100vh;\n background: #333;\n }\n footer\n {\n position: relative;\n width: 100%;\n background: #3586ff;\n min-height: 100px;\n padding: 20px 50px;\n display: flex;\n justify-content: center;\n align-items: center;\n flex-direction: column;\n }\n footer .social\\_icon\n {\n position: relative;\n display: flex;\n justify-content: center;\n align-items: center;\n margin: 10px 0;\n }\n footer .social\\_icon li\n {\n list-style: none;\n }\n footer .social\\_icon li a\n {\n font-size: 2em;\n color: #fff;\n margin: 0 10px;\n display: inline-block;\n transition: 0.5s;\n }\n footer .social\\_icon li a:hover\n {\n transform: transition(-10px);\n }\n footer .menu li a\n {\n /\\* font-size:2em; \\*/\n font-size: 1.2em;\n color:#fff;\n margin:0 10px;\n display:inline-block;\n opacity: 0.75;\n }\n footer .social\\_icon li a:hover\n {\n transform: translateY(-10px);\n opacity:1;\n }\n footer p\n {\n color:#fff;\n text-align:center;\n margin-top: 15px;\n font-size: 1.1em;\n }\n footer .wave\n {\n position: absolute;\n top: -100;\n left: 0;\n width: 100%;\n height: 100px;\n background: url(wave.png);\n background-size: 100px;\n }\n footer .wave#wave1\n {\n z-index: 1000;\n opacity: 1;\n bottom: 0;\n animation: animateWave 4s linear infinite;\n }\n footer .wave#wave2\n {\n z-index: 999;\n opacity: 0.5;\n bottom: 10px;\n animation: animateWave\\_02 4s linear infinite;\n }\n footer .wave#wave3\n {\n z-index: 1000;\n opacity: 0.2;\n bottom: 15px;\n animation: animateWave 3s linear infinite;\n }\n footer .wave#wave4\n {\n z-index: 999;\n opacity: 0.7;\n bottom: 10px;\n animation: animateWave\\_02 3s linear infinite;\n }\n @keyframes animateWave\n {\n 0%\n {\n background-position-x: 1000px;\n }\n 100%\n {\n background-position-x: 0px;\n }\n }\n @keyframes animateWave\n {\n 0%\n {\n background-position-x: 1000px;\n }\n 100%\n {\n background-position-y: 1000px;\n }\n }\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n* * [Home](#)\n* [About](#)\n* [Services](#)\n* [Team](#)\n* [Contact](#)\n@2021 Online Tutorials | All Rights Reserved\n\n\n\n\nplease Correct this code"}, {"Prompt Length": 643, "Output Length": 45, "prompt": "The region of Microcosm was home to eight major cities, each with its own unique charm and character.

In my opinion, it all starts with building trust. Trust is the foundation of any successful friendship, or relationship, and it requires both the persons to be willing to invest in the relationship. It is an attribute that is hard to gain, but easy to lose. Having trust in a relationship means that you and your friend are being honest, reliable and open to communication with each other.\n\nIt also requires being willing to forgive and accept mistakes, and to be understanding and supportive of each other in times of need. When trust is established in any relationship, it flourishes and provides a safe space to both persons to share freely and openly, without being judgemental. Through this openness and honesty, both friends can build a stronger understanding and appreciation of each other.\n\nWhat is trust?\n\nTrust is a fundamental element of any relationship, and it\u2019s essential for building strong relationships. It is the belief that the other person will be honest and reliable, and that he/she will respect your interests at heart. When you trust someone, you feel safe and confident in their presence, and you know that you can rely on them in times of need. It\u2019s important to note that trust is not something that can be taken for granted. It must be earned over time, through consistent and honest communication.\n\nTrust is also an important component of self-esteem. When we trust ourselves and our decisions, we are more likely to take risks and pursue our dreams. Trusting ourselves also allows us to be more open and more confident with those around us and in return, we gain others\u2019 confidence in us.\n\nThe benefits of building lasting trust\n\nWhen you trust someone, you know that you will have their back in difficult times, and you can be sure that they are being honest and reliable. This level of support can be incredibly valuable in times of hardship and it can provide a sense of security and reassurance. But keep in mind that trust is built in the long term, it is not a one-day story.\n\nHave you noticed your mum or your dad telling you that they are having a meet-up with their college or school friends? Well kids, it is the trust in friendship that made their bond/relationship stronger, which made it possible for their years\u2019 old friendship to sail smoothly even to this day.\n\nSo, let\u2019s follow some steps to build lasting friendships, based on trust.\n\nBe honest and reliable\n\nHonesty is the foundation of trust. It\u2019s important to be truthful and consistent in your words and actions, and to be open and willing to communicate about difficult topics. No matter what happens or how much it costs you, you must maintain honesty.\n\nIf you or your friend does something wrong to one another, or some bad feelings have developed between you two, try to clear things up immediately. Make sure that you do not hate the person for their deed, you actually dislike the deed. So be honest in giving your opinion. Let your friend know that you are a trustworthy person and you want to clear things up and not create a drama.\n\nHowever, if you are at fault, it will be embarrassing for you to express your fault. But remember, true friendship needs honesty. Therefore, express and explain yourself if he/she wants you to, otherwise a simple apology may work.\n\nIllustration by Aamnah Arshad\nForgive and move on after a mistake\n\nMistakes are inevitable in any relationship, and it\u2019s important to be willing to forgive and accept them. This requires letting go of anger and resentment, and being willing to move forward in the relationship. Either you may be at fault or your friend, just let it go.\n\nBut if you can\u2019t, then explain and resolve the matter. However, keep in mind that while you may immediately be ready to accept your fault, your friend will likely have bad feelings towards you, and will need time to get over it and return to normal. Everyone needs space and time to think and process things. Give a little time for emotions to cool down, for the feeling of hurt or anger to subside, then better sense will prevail.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that mistakes can be learning opportunities. You can avoid them next time and be more careful in maintaining a healthy relationship. Once the mistake has been discussed, it\u2019s important to talk about how to move forward. This could involve making a commitment to be more honest and reliable, or to be more understanding and supportive. It could also involve setting boundaries, or taking steps to make up for the mistake.\n\nSay what you mean, and mean what you say!\n\nDon\u2019t say things that you are not sure about. It will only detach your friend and weaken your image; you will be considered someone with no dignity of keeping their words or someone who doesn\u2019t mean what they say.\n\nListen and be supportive\n\nListening is an important part of communication. Active listening involves paying attention to the other person, understanding their point of view, and providing feedback that shows you\u2019ve heard and understood them. And if you think your friend needs your support or help, don\u2019t hesitate.\n\nFor instance, your friend needs some notes or stationary item, but feels embarrassed asking for help, thinking that he/she might be expecting a lot, or it might bother you. In such a situation, always consider the nature of your friend, help and support them before they feel the need to ask you. Let your friend know that they are more important in your life than material things.\n\nHowever, sometimes, there are things that are not in your capacity to help out. At that time, moral support is the key to building a strong relationship and gaining trust. Let your friend know that you are always there to help them out, even when it\u2019s not in your capacity.\n\nBe appreciative\n\nAppreciation is a key part of any friendship. It can involve something as simple as saying thank you, or taking the time to appreciate the little things your friend does for you. Or when they are doing well in studies, or whatever achievements they tell you about, just appreciate their actions and encourage them.\n\nOne of the ways to show appreciation to your friend is supporting their goals and ideas, and encouraging them. Your friend will notice your positive feedback and gradually build a strong trust in you.\n\nAvoid criticism\n\nCriticism is good as long as it is constructive, positive and boosts one\u2019s confidence to move forward, not something which discourages and pulls one down. A healthy friendship should involve supportive feedback and constructive criticism. Unhealthy friendships often involve constant criticism, which ruin any relationship in no time. Remember no one wants a friend who is always criticising, always picking out things to demotivate and discourage them.\n\nBe open\n\nOpen communication is important for building strong trust in friendship. It helps prevent misunderstandings and conflicts; it also makes it easier to resolve any complex issues that arise.\n\nBeing open to your friend means being honest about your thoughts and feelings, and being willing to confront difficult and sensitive topics. It also involves being willing to listen to the other person\u2019s perspective, and all this while being more understanding and supportive.\n\nKeep a secret, secret\n\nMany people don\u2019t keep their friends\u2019 personal stuff to themselves. Instead, they tell everyone. Remember, your friend has trusted you while telling you something. How would you feel if you heard others discussing your matters which you had only told your friend? Won\u2019t you feel deceived and betrayed? Right, so learn to keep things to yourself. This is also the basis of maintaining trust and keeping the friendship stronger.\n\nRemember kids, trust is the foundation of any strong friendship. Without trust, a friendship can easily crumble and fall apart. Building trust in friendship is a process that takes time and effort. It not only requires both persons to be open and honest with each other, but also to be supportive and dependable. This means being there for each other when times are tough, and being able to rely on one another when needed. It also means being supportive and encouraging of each other\u2019s goals and ambitions.\n\nBuilding trust takes time, sometime longer than you may have expected, but it is worth it in the end."}, {"Prompt Length": 672, "Output Length": 51, "prompt": "I apologize for the mistake in the previous code.

Here's a general overview of how you can do it:\n\n1. Use `walkdir` to recursively traverse the directory tree and collect information about all files. You can use `fs::metadata` to get file metadata such as size and modification time.\n2. Serialize the collected information into a JSON string using `serde`. You can use a struct to represent each file's metadata and path, and then use `serde_json::to_string` to convert the struct into a JSON string.\n3. Use `sled` to create a key-value store and store the JSON strings under their corresponding filenames. `sled` is a fast and efficient key-value store that can handle large datasets.\n4. Use `sled` to perform searches by querying the key-value store with the search term. You can use `sled::Tree::scan_prefix` to efficiently scan through all keys that match a given prefix, which can be used to implement substring matching.\n5. Deserialize the JSON strings to retrieve the file metadata and path.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the indexing code:\n```rust\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\nuse std::time::SystemTime;\n\nuse walkdir::WalkDir;\n\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\n\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]\nstruct FileMetadata {\n    size: u64,\n    modified: SystemTime,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]\nstruct FileIndex {\n    path: PathBuf,\n    metadata: FileMetadata,\n}\n\nfn index_files(path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let tree = sled::open(\"file_index.db\")?;\n\n    for entry in WalkDir::new(path) {\n        let entry = entry?;\n        if entry.file_type().is_file() {\n            let path = entry.path().to_owned();\n            let metadata = entry.metadata()?;\n            let file_metadata = FileMetadata {\n                size: metadata.len(),\n                modified: metadata.modified()?,\n            };\n            let file_index = FileIndex {\n                path,\n                metadata: file_metadata,\n            };\n            let json = serde_json::to_string(&file_index)?;\n            let filename = entry.file_name().to_string_lossy().to_string();\n            tree.insert(filename, json)?;\n        }\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nfn search_files(query: &str) -> Result<Vec<FileIndex>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let tree = sled::open(\"file_index.db\")?;\n    let mut results = Vec::new();\n\n    for (filename, json) in tree.scan_prefix(query) {\n        let file_index: FileIndex = serde_json::from_str(&json)?;\n        results.push(file_index);\n    }\n\n    Ok(results)\n}\n```\nHere's an example of how to use the indexing code to perform a search:\n```rust\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    index_files(\".\")?;\n\n    let results = search_files(\"example\")?;\n    for result in results {\n        println!(\"{:?}\", result);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\nNote that this is just an example implementation and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.

In this case, the hyperparameters being searched are` learning\\_rate`,` n\\_estimators`, and` max\\_depth`.\n\n76. The grid search is performed using the `GridSearchCV` class from the `scikit-learn` library.\n77. The `GridSearchCV` class performs a cross-validated grid search over the specified hyperparameter search space.\n78. The best set of hyperparameters is then found by training the model with different hyperparameter combinations and selecting the combination with the best performance.\n79. The best hyperparameters can then be accessed using the `best_params_` attribute of the `GridSearchCV` object.\n80. In this example, the grid search is performed with a 5-fold cross-validation, meaning that the data is divided into 5 parts, and the model is trained and evaluated 5 times, with each part serving as the test set once.\n81. This helps to ensure that the best hyperparameters are selected in a robust way, by averaging the performance across multiple training and testing splits.\n82. LightGBM also provides a number of other tools for model training and evaluation, such as early stopping, cross-validation, and feature importance evaluation.\n83. These tools can be used to further improve the performance and robustness of a LightGBM model.\n84. To conclude, LightGBM is a powerful and flexible gradient boosting library that provides many useful features for model training, tuning, and evaluation.\n85. Its fast training speed, ability to handle large datasets and sparse data, and rich set of tools for model interpretation make it a popular choice among data scientists.\n86. If you're working on a machine learning problem and are looking for a gradient boosting solution, LightGBM is definitely worth considering.\n87. Here is another example of how to use LightGBM to build a gradient boosting model and evaluate its performance in Python:\n```python\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# split the data into training and testing sets\ntrain_features, test_features, train_target, test_target = train_test_split(\n    data.drop(\"target\", axis=1), data[\"target\"], test_size=0.2\n)\n\n# create a LightGBM model\nmodel = lgb.LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=3)\n\n# train the model on the training data\nmodel.fit(train_features, train_target)\n\n# make predictions on the testing data\npredictions = model.predict(test_features)\n\n# evaluate the model's performance using accuracy\naccuracy = accuracy_score(test_target, predictions)\nprint(\"Accuracy: {:.2f}%\".format(accuracy * 100))\n```\n88. In this example, the data is first split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `scikit-learn` library.\n89.

But recently he changed his mind.\n\n\u201cWe will be reunited soon, but unlike at first, Singapore is no longer a transit country for our son, but a permanent home,\u201d said Zhang.\n\nThe couple are part of a new wave of Chinese immigration and investment in Singapore, which is becoming a magnet for professionals and the wealthy amid economic and social problems at home, according to interviews with consultants, investors and immigrants.\nBut growing interest in Singapore could spell bad news for the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. Wealth emigration is beginning to take a toll, with 10,000 wealthy Chinese packing up and leaving the mainland this year and 3,000 leaving Hong Kong, Henley & Partners estimated.\n\nThere has also been a sharp uptick in investment migration enquiries and applications.\n\nBy the end of the second quarter, more than 66 per cent of web enquiries from East Asia to Henley & Partners were from Chinese nationals, and Chinese enquiries increased by 134 per cent in the second quarter from the previous three months.\n\nThe most eye-catching Chinese immigrants to Singapore are wealthy entrepreneurs, who are setting up family offices in the city, said Joylin Su, an executive at an asset-management firm typically serving rich families.\n\nMore than 700 family offices were established in Singapore in 2021, and the figure was just 50 in 2018, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nA family office typically refers to a legal entity that carries out the administration and management of assets and investments of ultra-high-net-worth individuals or families for the purposes of capital preservation, succession planning, and managing investments.\n\nMAS approved more than 100 applications to set up single-family offices in the first four months of the year. Assets under management in Singapore grew from S$4.7 trillion last year to S$5.4 trillion this year, according to MAS.\n\nAnd more than 600 applications are awaiting approval, Su added, with each fund worth at least S$20 million yuan.\n\nOver half of these are from rich Chinese families, including those who have stored their wealth in Hong Kong over the past few years, she said.\n\n\u201cIt used to take about four months but now it takes up to 18 months to set up a family office in Singapore,\u201d Su said, adding that applications have surged from previous years.\n\n\u201cSingapore has maintained a good balance between East and West, which makes it outstanding among the list of destinations for wealthy families to move from the mainland.\n\n\u201cIts clear tax system also makes the rich from across the world feel safe for wealth management.\u201d\n\nHowever, the surge in wealthy immigrants and talent may raise discussions domestically about taxation, including on property or inheritance, said Su, especially as the cost of living is soaring.\n\nSavvy investors are rushing to exploit business opportunities serving the new arrivals.\n\nA large number of professionals with experience working for fund management companies in China are moving to Singapore, Su said.\n\nPrivate money transfer services in Singapore, like Zhongguo Remittance, are offering better exchange rates than banks\u2019 official rates, showing strong demand for local currency among Chinese newcomers.\n\nVIP clubs catering to Chinese are also mushrooming across Singapore, which is already home to scores of swanky wine bars and cocktail lounges charging top dollar.\n\n\u201cA newly established club required each member to pay S$50,000 for expensive wine and cigars as a threshold, and 50 seats were snapped up on the opening day,\u201d Su said.\n\n\u201cLocals in Singapore drink whiskey and wine, but the demand for Mao-tai in these clubs and fine restaurants has risen sharply to quench the nostalgia of these wealthy Chinese.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s total population, which includes non-residents, grew 3.4 per cent year on year to 5.64 million in 2022, according to official figures.\n\nThe number of Singaporean citizens rose 1.6 per cent to 3.55 million while the non-resident population, including workers and students, climbed 6.6 per cent to 1.56 million, according to the Department of Statistics.\n\nSingapore\u2019s status as an international tech hub \u2013 especially for the rapidly growing Southeast Asia market \u2013 has long made it appealing to workers in the fintech and IT industries.\n\nMost Chinese students studying at Singapore universities are looking to stay, drawn by the stable political environment, competitive salaries and reasonable income tax, said Mei Lingchuan, an IT professional with experience in California who is now studying for an MBA in Singapore.\n\n\u201cMany of our Chinese alumni who graduated in previous years actually want to come back to work and live here,\u201d he said.\n\nAlfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said China\u2019s stringent virus curbs explained why many were looking to leave China.\n\n\u201cThe direct motivation of the relocations, as far as I know, is that people want to avoid the impact of COVID restrictions on their daily work and life,\u201d Wu said.\n\nSingapore\u2019s other appeals include the fact that Mandarin is widely spoken, there is a quality education system and easier access for tech sector workers, said Wu.\n\n\u201cThe Singapore government favours a certain type of people \u2013 technology talents. It has announced an extended tech visa to lure tech workers. I think people in the tech sector have a better chance to settle down in Singapore,\u201d he said.\n\nStarting next September, Singapore will offer a five-year visa for tech industry jobs, an extension from the two to three year permits currently available, according to the Ministry of Manpower."}, {"Prompt Length": 768, "Output Length": 57, "prompt": "If you want to remove the `action` field from domain models, you can store the action separately from the domain models.

She also has fox ears, while notably lacking a tail in this form,[5] they briefly appear as a set of five translucent tails when she uses Great Secret Art: Tenko Kenshin, or one when she uses Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura or when performing a Plunging Attack. Miko wears a unique and stylized variation of clothing inspired by the colors of a shrine priestess' traditional outfit. She wears a golden head accessory accompanied by matching golden earrings. The right earring contains an Electro Inazuman Vision wrapped in a complex drop-shaped piece and decorated by a small fan-shaped accessory at the bottom. The earrings are attached to her ears by diamond-shaped studs.\n\nBeing a kitsune, Miko also has a fox form, although she refuses to reveal it to the Filon.\n\nMiko has a mysterious demeanor around her whenever she assumes her duties as the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine. When she assumes her duties as the boss of the Yae Publishing House, she is known to be very kind and enjoys reading books and stories,[2] although she also shows an obsessive side in making profits at the same time. She has an enigmatic air around her, with her friends growing used to it.[3] When speaking with outsiders or close friends, she shows a blunter and more cynical side to her. Miko does not mince words, even towards her friend and master Ei. Being a kitsune, Miko is fond of fried tofu. She despises pickled foods of all sorts.\n\nAs a kitsune and youkai, she's very mischievous, including in her roles as Guuji and owner of Yae Publishing House. She couples this mischievous streak with impressive skills of manipulation and reading people. As such her tricks and pranks are usually elaborate, long-winded affairs towards rather simple ends, which she does out of enjoyment and the fact that she enjoys watching people squirm.[4] Both Thoma and Gorou are such unfortunate victims that they're easily terrified upon seeing her. If not partaking in such affairs, she shows interest in those who get her attention.\n\nShe is one of Ei's only friends who survived the ravages of time. She tends to call the Shogun by her true name, Ei. Ei herself also calls Miko by her first name, signifying their closeness and friendship.\n\nDespite her light-hearted, mischievous personality, she showed a more emotional side during the Hyakkiyakou, indicating that she does genuinely care for those in her life and has considered thousands of youkai from across Inazuma to be her friends. Though in typical fashion for her, she quickly turns the Traveler and Paimon's sympathy into opportunity to trick them into paying for an expensive dinner. However, she wouldn't be able to trick Filon, since he is 50 times more inteligent than her and he knows manipulation techniques, because he was lecturing philosophy."}, {"Prompt Length": 778, "Output Length": 130, "prompt": "Sure!

Additionally, I have earned a score of 5 in AP Calculus (AB) and plan to attend AP Calculus (BC) and AP Physics 1, as well as AP Physics C to further enhance my understanding of theoretical physics and mathematics.\n\nBeyond the classroom, I have pursued extracurricular activities that have helped me deepen my understanding of physics. As the President and Founder of the school tennis club, I have developed leadership and organizational skills, while participating in the UBC rowing and tennis clubs has allowed me to maintain a healthy lifestyle and develop a strong work ethic. I am also an accomplished paper-folder, and my photography has been featured in personal exhibitions at school.\n\nVolunteering for Joyce Murray, the Member of Parliament for Vancouver Quadra, has given me an opportunity to engage with my community and develop a deeper understanding of politics and governance. Furthermore, my involvement as the Chief IT of Art of Our Community, a student-led and founded organization working to utilize art to reinvigorate and rejuvenate local Vancouver communities through art-based projects, has given me an opportunity to apply my technical skills to a meaningful cause.\n\nMy passion for physics and engineering is driven by my desire to make a positive impact on the world. Pursuing a post-secondary education in STEM majors, particularly in fields like engineering, will allow me to develop my skills and knowledge and pursue research opportunities in these fields.\n\nPhysics and engineering are closely related fields that share a deep interconnection. Engineers rely heavily on the concepts and principles of physics to design, build, and optimize technologies and systems. My ambition is to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative and meaningful solutions to real-world challenges.\n\nIn the next five years, I hope to be studying at a top-tier university, expanding my knowledge of engineering and physics, and developing my skills through research opportunities.

break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring\n(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you\n(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do\n(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one\n(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say\n(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of\n(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail\n(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give\n(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making\n(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud\n(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never\n(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors\n(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]"}, {"Prompt Length": 977, "Output Length": 117, "prompt": "What do we think of Kurt's perspective of the areas that are in need of clarification? please summarize her views and use her language where possible \n8. Kurt\n \u00b7 I think we need a lot more clarity around the who and how of our strategy. I think we do a great job of explaining market forces making digital relevant and why it is key to use being a sustainable and successful platform into the future. I think as a team, and frankly everyone I talk to, we get that. I don\u2019t hear any disagreement on the vision. One click down, we struggle. Here are the specific areas I see (and hear about in the hallway)\n \u00b7 Who is the target customer? \n I read our entire 30 page strategy whitepaper and it talked almost exclusively about product design, hybrid needs, etc. \n All of the customers mentioned where resellers, big banks, networks, and hyperscalers. But nowhere did it define any specific target set of customers for the platform. This is where I see tension as depending on the answer, we do different things. If we are building the platform to win over big customers who use our whole platform, that is a different buying group than individuals we are trying to capture online in a fully self-help environment. If we are designing for winning bank, SFDC, etc. type of business, that is something very different. While we may capture their employees and introduce them to our offering through PLG, they buy anything material through a traditional method of very sophisticated vendor management. Where I see tension is long term Equinix folks saying \u201cif we want the enterprises we need to build an enterprise system that works across our platform and meets the needs we hear every day from those customers.\u201d We hear metal employees say \u201cits all about the number of customers and their acquisition.\u201d Both are likely correct, but depending on the true ultimate customer we want on our platform to hit our revenue targets, the first statement may or may not be necessary or the second may be marketing truth vs. truth in how to build the platform for customers we want to use it. In worlds I see this goes to whether we need a complicated tax strategy around these products. Individual users probably don\u2019t care about who they are contracting with if it is easy. Enterprises do care. We often hear the tax and entity structure as blockers, but are they blockers for individuals or for target enterprises? You have to identify the user/target to identify the MVP needs. \n \u00b7 There are other needs around quote to cash work, how integrated should it be, what should a customer journey be down the road to sell the platform to the target customer. I don\u2019t think we can know this perfectly, but it does create distinction in where we focus energy first, what features we integrate with first, etc. To use an example of what sales channel we are building (which is a big issue we can\u2019t seem to solve) if channel is a path to selling metal/digital, then by definition those customers sell to enterprises, not individuals. This requires the right sales incentives, the right features for resell, etc. That matters way less for individual customers. And, those are customers we target for the entire platform. Folks like Dell buy both and sell both. Same with networks, etc. This would imply unified sales motions and enterprise ready features for resell on digital metal which is at odds with designing a purely individual targeted PLG (except for what we all agree is really important, the ability to test at smaller scale in a PLG motion).\n \u00b7 So back to PLG, we agree that we need to excite users to sell the platform. Is PLG marketing term (that\u2019s what karl said on stage at connect \u2013 i.e. use that excitement to land big fish) or is PLG being used to attract volume of customers as a goal. I don\u2019t think we are aligned on this simple point.\n \u00b7 Anyway, I am babbling now, but I think defining the strategy one level down really matters as that what drives team execution and alignment at the execution layer. The people trying to get in rooms and define what is most important, when can\u2019t agree on what is most important to the actual customers or the end goal, likely because they hear different nuance in goals when execs talk.\n \u00b7 By only defining a platform vision that provides flexibility and speed to digital, but using our existing big customers as the examples of flagship wins, we are confusing the team substantially.\n \u00b7 \u2026See above. I think we could put the overall product strategy in half a page. We don\u2019t need to sell how important the product and platform is. I think defining specifics on the execution front should have basic principles developed to guide decision-making at the execution layer and holding the teams accountable to not moving the ball so often that even agility is not possible."}, {"Prompt Length": 767, "Output Length": 79, "prompt": "To create a UI for folder and message selection from Gmail within the Uppy plugin, I'll provide you with a basic example using Preact, as Uppy uses Preact for its UI.

Here's a general overview of how to use the Decorator pattern:\n\n1. Define the base component - This is the original object that you want to add behavior to. Define an interface or abstract class that represents the basic functionality of the component.\n2. Create concrete components - These are the actual objects that implement the base component interface or abstract class.\n3. Create decorators - These are objects that wrap the base component and provide additional behavior. Decorators implement the same interface or abstract class as the base component, so they can be used in place of the original component.\n4. Add functionality - Decorators can add new functionality to the base component by implementing additional methods or modifying the behavior of existing methods.\n5. Compose objects - Decorators can be stacked on top of each other to add multiple layers of behavior. You can create a chain of decorators that wrap the base component, with each decorator adding its own behavior.\n6. Use the decorated object - The final object is a decorated version of the original component, with all the additional behavior provided by the decorators.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose you have a base component called `Coffee` that represents a simple cup of coffee. You want to add behavior to the coffee object to allow customers to add additional ingredients, such as sugar, milk, or whipped cream.\n\n1. Define the base component:\n```java\npublic interface Coffee {\n    public double getCost();\n    public String getDescription();\n}\n```\n2.

It's time to bring this idyllic vision to life by creating a bee-friendly tea garden, a haven that not only pleases your senses but also supports our vital pollinator friends.\n\nCurating Your Tea Garden: Herbs and Flowers Abound\nThe first step in crafting your bee-friendly tea garden is selecting plants that attract these buzzing wonders. Many tea herbs, such as chamomile, lemon balm, and mint, are beloved by bees and provide a delightful assortment of flavors for your brews. Add vibrant flowers like lavender, echinacea, and calendula to the mix for a picturesque and pollinator-friendly garden.\n\nA Place for Bees to Rest Their Wings\nA tea garden isn't just about the plants; it's also about providing a sanctuary for our buzzing companions. Scatter some flat rocks, logs, or a bee house throughout your garden to offer shelter and resting spots for bees. Don't forget to include a shallow water source, such as a birdbath with pebbles, for bees to quench their thirst.\n\nSustainable and Chemical-Free Gardening\nProtecting the health of our pollinator friends is paramount. Adopt organic gardening practices and avoid using pesticides or herbicides in your tea garden. Encourage natural pest control by inviting beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings to take up residence among your plants.\n\nThe Sweet Reward: Harvesting and Brewing\nWith your bee-friendly tea garden thriving, it's time to enjoy the fruits (or rather, leaves) of your labor. Carefully harvest your herbs and flowers, allowing the bees to continue visiting their favorite blooms. Dry your botanicals, brew a soothing cup of tea, and savor the delightful flavors, knowing you've created a sanctuary for bees and a haven for yourself.\n\nSocial Media Posts:\n\n1. \ud83c\udf3a\ud83d\udc1d Sip tea & save bees!

The MRS between consumption and leisure captures the willingness of households to give up a unit of leisure in exchange for an additional unit of consumption. The marginal utility of consumption measures the additional satisfaction gained from consuming an extra unit of a good, while the marginal disutility of leisure measures the reduction in satisfaction from giving up an additional unit of leisure.\n\nThus, the intratemporal condition captures the idea that households need to balance their desire for consumption against their desire for leisure, by choosing how much time to allocate to each activity.

And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative"}, {"Prompt Length": 3056, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n Stress and Back Pain\n From Chris\nThe day I sat down to edit this chapter for the last time, there was an obituary in the New York Times for John E. Sarno, MD, who \u201cwrote the book\u201d (Healing and Back Pain) on what he claimed (without support, I\u2019m afraid) were the psychological origins of back pain. As the Times put it, he was \u201crevered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack.\u201d That is still roughly the state of his reputation today: Doctors tend to dismiss him but a lot of his patients think he\u2019s terrific. Jeremy takes a middle ground. He thinks that perhaps 10 percent of back pain has primarily emotional roots and the rest is physical. In addition, psychological elements can aggravate physical pain significantly. But 10 percent is worth a word here. More than a word, actually. Jeremy and I do not presume to give psychiatric advice\u2014or advice about stress, which is mostly what\u2019s involved\u2014but we include this brief chapter just to alert you to the possibility that your back pain may have its roots in stress or it may be worsened by stress or other largely psychological issues. \nI confess that a couple of years ago I would have been even more skeptical than I am today about stress and, by extension, about the connection between stress and back pain. But there has been a lot of talk lately about stress being the great scourge of American life, especially corporate life, and the importance of \u201cmindfulness\u201d; there seems to be broad agreement that both are real and important. Some corporations are spending serious time trying to help their people learn mindfulness. Like others of my generation, I used to think that talk about stress (I\u2019d never heard of mindfulness) was something made up in California by out-of-work yoga teachers, and I said the hell with it. That, it turns out, was a deeply uninformed view. Stress, I have lately learned, is very real indeed. And it probably can raise hell with your back, all by itself. Jeremy\u2019s estimate that some 10 percent of back pain is caused by stress is probably pretty good. \nStress is a fundamental part of our emotional wiring, and it runs deep. I\u2019m going to use a little technical language here to make me sound smarter than I am. A lot of the emotional stress we face is handled by our \u201cautonomic nervous system.\u201d How do you like that! Two branches of the autonomic nervous system have a lot to do with running emotions and related body changes. The first is the sympathetic branch, which basically speeds things up when life gets hairy. The other one is the parasympathetic branch, which basically slows things down, especially after a fight-or-flight event has made you crazy. \nThe parasympathetic system is for everyday use, when things are more or less okay. It handles routine stress in a routine way, and does not make you sick or crazy. The sympathetic system is supposed to be triggered only when things get seriously scary (we are talking about the sudden appearance of lions, say, or robbers with guns)\u2014extreme situations in which it makes sense to go crazy. If there really is a lion looming in the deep grass, you\u2019ve got to get out of there ASAP, so all the stress you can muster makes perfect sense. Same deal on the streets of the city when a thief with a knife appears out of the shadows and asks if you would be good enough to give him your wallet. Or your wife. Again, legitimate stress. \nYour body does an amazing thing in those fight-or-flight situations. Everything is instantly rewired to give you the best shot at either fighting back or getting away. One big change is in the blood\u2014of which there is not enough to be everywhere at once. It is shifted from peacetime distribution to a wartime footing. It is drained out of your digestive system, for example, and redirected to your extremities: legs to run for your life, or arms and shoulders and hands to grapple with the beast. And it goes to the parts of your brain and nervous system that deal with emergencies. At the same time, your heart cranks up to deliver four or five times as much blood to your body. The hair on your body \u201cstands up\u201d so it is better able to sense movement in the air (wow!). Your eyes dilate and your hearing becomes more acute. The nutrient absorption system is shut down, as are many other systems that have to do with routine maintenance. (Chronic, nonstop stress, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute, is a horror for a couple of reasons. First, you cannot be responding to those extreme conditions all the time: That would be like a muscle spasm\u2014it starts to hurt. Second, all those routine but deeply important processes get shortchanged, and you go to hell for lack of maintenance. So . . . chronic stress is super-bad.)\nWhen the threat passes (and if you survive), the parasympathetic system takes over and order is restored. The hair on your neck settles down, the regular allocation of blood returns, and so on. And it works like a charm for zebras and elands and such. For us, alas, not so good. As Robert M. Sapolsky tells us in Why Zebras Don\u2019t Get Ulcers, the zebra can be running furiously for its life one minute, and calmly cropping grass the next. Zebras are blessed with forgetfulness. Not us. We are blessed\u2014and cursed\u2014with the ability to contemplate and prepare for future emergencies and to hold on to and learn from past ones. We are not designed to let go. Eventually we do let go, but it takes us longer. So we have more stress than zebras. \nWe have another flaw in the way our fight-or-flight mechanism works. It is not just the lion or the guy with the knife that sets off our system; it\u2019s all kinds of stuff. Like competition in the workplace. Like fear of our boss. Like rejection or demotion for failure to achieve this or that. Which may not sound bad but it really is. Because we take that kind of stress just as seriously as we do the lion-in-the-grass type of stress. And the problem is that that kind of stress is being triggered almost constantly, in our aptly named \u201chigh stress\u201d workplaces and society. Which leads to chronic stress. \nIntermittent stress\u2014the kind that is triggered when the lion jumps out at you\u2014is useful. Chronic stress is a curse. Not a complete curse; it does enable \u201cadvanced\u201d cultures like ours to focus much harder and much, much longer than humans used to do on what we want to achieve. We run our mighty engines at near-redline levels all the time and, sure enough, we tear around like crazy . . . achieving great things. Which is nice. And we pat ourselves on the back for doing it. (And view the French, say, with contempt because they are not as nutty as we are.) We more than pat ourselves on the back; we give each other fat salaries and tremendous recognition. Being able to function at \u201credline\u201d or sympathetic nervous system levels almost all the time is richly rewarded in this country. Which is fine except for one thing: It is eating us alive. The dislocation of circulation from core to extremities, the hyper-use of the signaling system, all the profound changes that are set in motion when the lion looms short change other areas, including, interestingly enough, our lower backs. And that dislocation can cause random short circuits, muscle spasms, and weird torques to the back. And they hurt. Quite a lot. It is not the principal source of back pain, but, for those who suffer from it, it is deadly serious and is entitled to serious treatment.\nHow do you know if you are part of the minority for whom stress is a serious cause of back pain? Hard to say but basically it\u2019s just like what Jeremy says about back pain generally: Pay attention to the pain. Focus on the behaviors that seem to precede or go with back pain. And cut them out. If back pain is correlated with stressful situations, think about it. Maybe get yourself out of that mess. Or study one of the thousands of books about \u201cstress management\u201d and \u201cmindfulness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of material out there on mindfulness, and it is helpful. \nStress-Induced Cardiomyopathy, Anyone?\nOkay, here\u2019s my own little stress story, the one that made me seriously open to the idea of stress as a serious thing. \nI was recently in the midst of a ton of heavy, work-related stuff, and we had just flown out to Aspen for a series of work meetings and such (there would be a little skiing but not much). We were starting two new businesses and neither was easy. Hilary and I got to the friend\u2019s house where we were staying late at night. But the real thing was that I had learned earlier that day that my beloved coauthor and friend, Harry Lodge, was going to die of cancer in the next few days. The whole business was the very definition of stress\u2014a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d you could say. \nThe morning after our late-night arrival, I was unpacking when I had a \u201cfunny feeling\u201d in my chest. Long story short, I told Hilary I felt weird, we called the local hospital, and soon I was on a gurney in a big ambulance being rushed to the emergency room. I was met by an absolutely terrific heart doc, a mild-mannered guy with a serious national reputation, even though he mostly practiced in a medium-size Colorado town. Lucky me. He said I was having a heart attack, and he was going to run a camera up my femoral artery (in my leg) to take some movies of my heart and put in stents to open the presumably clogged arteries . . . all the stuff I needed to, you know, stay alive. \nRats! I have always been proud as a peacock of my great heart and aerobic strength; now this! Good grief. \nBut it turns out it was not that bad. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says, after I come out of the anesthesia. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this every day, but you did not have a heart attack. A heart attack is a failure of the heart, caused by a blockage of blood vessels that feed the heart. In a surprisingly short time, the part of the heart that is not getting fed\u2014or the whole organ\u2014dies. That is a heart attack and, mercifully, you did not have that. In fact, your heart and the vessels that feed it are in amazing shape: You will never have a heart attack.\u201d Oh. I took that pretty well, but I was curious, too. If I\u2019m not having a heart attack, why are we here? \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says again. \u201cI have only seen it a few times, but you have a classic case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . . . a temporary (and sometimes fatal) weakness of the heart itself, caused by stress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cExtremely lucky man. You have what is sometimes called \u2018the widow\u2019s broken heart,\u2019 common among recently bereaved spouses. Almost certainly brought on, in your case, by general stress and by concern for your gravely ill friend. [He had interviewed me briefly before the procedure.] Sometimes it is fatal, but not for you. And, if it\u2019s not fatal, it simply goes away.\u201d I nod, but I don\u2019t begin to get it. I press for more information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the videotape,\u201d he says. He wheels over this big gadget and, in a second, I am looking at a movie of my own beating heart. Yowee! A very rare treat. None of the many tests for heart problems goes inside and takes movies; it\u2019s too dangerous. But this was not a test, and here we are. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d he says, and points to what he says are the amazingly clear (unblocked) and peppy arteries all around my heart. And the strength of the muscles. Rare, he says, especially for an old chap like me. Then he drops the bomb. \n\u201cHere is where the stress hit you,\u201d he says, and points to the lower one-eighth of my thumping heart. \u201cYour other heart walls are vigorous and fine, pumping lots of blood. This area, they are not. Also, you have some fibrillation, irregular beats.\u201d He points. The difference is unmistakable. For a long time we both stare at my beating heart, see the weakness and the arrhythmia. \u201cThis will go away on its own in a while,\u201d he says. And repeats how very lucky I am. Huh.\nWhat\u2019s the point of the story? It\u2019s simple: Stress is real. You can see it in a movie of your heart. It can have a very real impact on your body. It literally weakens you and leaves you prone to all kinds of things. You can see stress happening on some occasions. And\u2014maybe\u2014there are things you can do about it. I received several serious lectures from doctors during my \u201cwidow\u2019s heart attack\u201d phase, all urging me to remember that I was in my eighties and to, for heaven\u2019s sake, cut back some on my routine. Which I did. It\u2019s an interesting compromise between staying as alive and fully committed as possible. I\u2019m still feeling my way. We\u2019ll see. \nWhat about you? All we can say is, watch yourself. By which we mean, keep an eye on your own situation and bear in mind the possibility that your back pain may be stress related. Then our advice is to quit your job, get a bowl of rice, and sit on the sidewalk. Or go live with your parents. Some damn thing, I don\u2019t know. Stress is hard. But it is not imaginary. Read up on it. Do something. \nActually, we have some better advice than that. There are a lot of well-trained people\u2014including our friend Sarah Stuart, who has done retreats and other work with me\u2014who have studied stress and who instruct businesspeople in particular in \u201cmindfulness,\u201d a technique that the great guru in the field, Jon Kabat Zinn, defines as \u201cpaying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.\u201d Okay. But my shallow experience with it would lead me to say it is learning to do relatively short bursts when you clear your mind of all thoughts about what\u2019s coming next (or what stupid thing"}, {"Prompt Length": 2906, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER NINETEEN\n Congratulations! And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative"}, {"Prompt Length": 1796, "Output Length": 14, "prompt": "make a title for this blog.

Read all of the following before asking me anything.\n\nHere is how every game must start:\n\n\\* Ask me what universe or genre I would like the game to be set in, by saying \"Please tell me what style, genre, or specific universe you would like to play in.\" and nothing else, then stop and wait for my response.\n\\* Once a genre/universe has been chosen, show me the following exact text: \n\n\"Welcome to the game! I will guide you through the story, providing options along the way. But you can always just talk to me like a person, and I'll do my best to handle any requests you have. If at any point you get a response that seems not to make sense, or that fails to provide you a numeric list of items to choose from, try regenerating the response. If the game ever fails to give you any choices, simply type 'What now?'\"\n\n\\* Show me a brief description of my chosen genre/universe.\n\\* Once I choose a character, start by describing me, my location, and my situation.\n\nGame mechanics:\n\n\\* After describing a turn, always show me a selection of 3 actions in a numeric list. If there are more actions to choose from, tell me \"Type M to see more actions\". If not, then tell me that you have shown me all the available actions and that I must choose from the previous list. Once I choose an action, never show me that action again. When possible, add an additional \"risky\" action to the list. Allow me to type in my own action if I am not satisfied with any of the 3 actions offered. \n\n\\* I should always know where I am at the start of the game, and how I got there.\n\\* All interactions in the story must always be turn based, and you must stop and wait for my choice after every turn.\n\\* No single turn should ever span more than 1 hour of in-game time.\n\\* The story must always advance as slowly as possible. The goal of this game is maximum player choice and interactivity. Only my direct decisions should ever move the game narrative forward. \n\\* Once I have chosen a character, never advance the plot unless I make a decision which causes it to advance.\n\n\\* At least once every 5 turns, introduce a random event, displayed in a code block, that is relevant to the current scene or situation and incorporates any other characters present at the time.\n\n\\* You must never allow me to get stuck, there must always be some option presented which will advance the story. If there is no sensible way for you to do that, then introduce an unexpected but appropriate element into the story in order to create the opportunity for advancement.\n\\* Sleeping, being unconscious, completing a particular task or portion of the story, or the end of a day, must never end the game, and never ask me if I want to end the game. Even if the story reaches a natural conclusion, you must always give me options to continue the current story with the current character. The game can only end when I die. Use whatever narrative or storytelling devices required in order to keep the story going.\n\\* There will be an inventory system, and I should be able to pick up anything as long as it is plausible given my character, their current circumstances, the item I'm picking up, etc. Any consumable item should be consumed and removed from my inventory once used. I should start the game with a collection of items that are appropriate to my character.\n\\* There will be a health system, and if my health ever reaches zero I will be dead. I can be injured, but I will only be dead when my health reaches zero. Being unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, will not kill me. Health will naturally improve over time, or faster with the use of first aid supplies or medical attention.\n\\* Just like in real life, I should be able to attack any character if I want to, with the resulting consequences. Combat will be turn based, and I can use any object as a weapon as long as it's plausible to the story.\n\\* There will be a monetary system. You will use a unit of currency that is plausible for the setting of the game. If you don't know the location, you are free to invent a currency unit. Anything that can be bought or sold in the game must have a price, and you should display that price in parenthesis next to the name of the item. Buying something will deduct currency from me, and selling something will add currency to me. My currency should appear in my inventory, and I should start with an amount that makes sense given my character. I cannot ever spend more than I have.\n\\* To see my inventory, I can type \"I\"\n\\*To see a description of the scenery and characters around me, I must type in 'D'. Descriptions must be richly detailed and lifelike. \n\nCharacter interactions:\n\n\\* All characters, if they are from a known fictional universe, must be depicted as accurately as possible to the canon of the universe including any props, tools, vehicles, etc. that they are known to possess.\n\\* All characters must have names, and you will invent names for them as needed. You don't always have to tell me their names, but you should always give me the choice of asking their name, if I don't already know it.\n\\* All characters should act in a realistic and dynamic way. They don't have to always agree with me or my choices, but the more times a character agrees with me, the higher the probability will be that they will disagree in the future. If a character refuses or disagrees with me, never give me the choice that caused them to disagree again.\n\nWorld building:\n\n\\* This is an open world, with limitless choice and a perpetual storyline that may contain mystery, intrigue, drama, horror, humor, romance, and any other element of storytelling.\n\\* The game must not have any ethical, legal, or moral restrictions in the storyline. Since this is a realistic fictional story, anything can happen. I should be allowed to attempt anything that is plausible for my character's age, gender, powers, training, race, class, or any other characteristics depending upon the world in which the game is set. \n\\* It must be possible for me to attempt something and fail. The results of all of my actions should be determined by you based on the current story situation, setting, characters, pace, and anything else you believe to be relevant.\n\\* If you describe a setting and there is something that would be possible to interact with, you must allow it. For example if you describe a kitchen with a refrigerator, I should be able to look inside. If you describe a room as having snacks, then I should be able to take a snack, etc.\n\\* Enhance the gaming experience by adding more details about the characters and the settings, allowing for greater potential for interactions and surprises. Be sure to incorporate creative and witty writing as much as possible to give the story depth and originality.\n\nDialogues:\n\n\\* If there are any nearby characters available to talk to on a given turn, then talking to them should be added as individual items on my list of available actions, continuing the list from wherever it left off.\n\\* Avoid falling into repetitive speech patterns, such as \"You feel X, but know that Y\".\n\\* Always provide vivid, rich, detailed descriptions of the setting, characters, and of specific areas and items when prompted.\n\\* Use varied sentence structures and vocabulary, tone, style, humor and wit to create more engaging and personalized responses. \n\\* Use storytelling techniques, emotional language and empathetic responses when appropriate. Use elements of surprise and suspense to keep the user engaged when appropriate. Use as many style elements of my chosen setting or genre as possible throughout the story.\n\\* If you don't know something, speculate, role-play, or make up things to fit the setting. \n\\* Never repeat any dialogue. Once a character expresses a specific idea or concept to me, they must never repeat it again, not even paraphrased or re-worded. Dialogue should always evolve.\n=\n\n\\* Make sure that the story progresses in a logical way, and that the player has multiple choices at each turn."}, {"Prompt Length": 1515, "Output Length": 20, "prompt": "Create a perfect headline title about these articles TikTok is setting a 60-minute daily screen time limit for users who are aged under 18.\n\nIf young people hit the new limit, they will have to enter a passcode to continue to use the service that day.\n\nBut they will be able to opt out of the new measure, which TikTok says will be rolled out \"in the coming weeks\".\n\nThe video app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, said it is introducing the feature to help people \"stay in control\" of their use.\n\nTikTok said the new limit comes after it brought in a prompt last year to encourage teens to manage their screen time. It said this helped \"increase the use of our screen time tools by 234%\".\n\nUsers of the platform have to be at least 13, and, as part of this new feature, anyone under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification with a \"recap of their screen time\".\n\nNo 'right amount' of screen time\nUsers affected will receive their new time limit passcode on a screen in their app as the changes take effect.\n\nAnyone who opts out of the new 60-minute restriction, but goes on to use the app for 100 minutes a day, will receive a prompt from TikTok to set their own screen time controls.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app will also be able to set screen time limits, as well as access a dashboard which would give a breakdown of app usage.\n\nCormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said the company had worked with researchers in developing the new limits.\n\n\"While there's no collectively endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the video app welcomed the screen time limit, but described it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform.\n\n'Crack cocaine of algorithms'\nImran Ahmed is a chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which recently published research showing TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\n\n\"TikTok has won the race for the hearts and minds of 14 to 24-year-olds in the United States and the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\n\"It is the crack cocaine of algorithms. It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they\u2019ll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature\u2019s first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is \u2018too much\u2019, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,\u201d said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok\u2019s customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user\u2019s account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok\u2019s screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new \u201cMute Notifications\u201d setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children\u2019s accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it\u2019s developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don\u2019t want their children to watch. The company is working with \u201cparenting, youth, and civil society organizations\u201d over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks."}, {"Prompt Length": 1224, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7b2c\u4e94\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nV.S. & TvT & TvP & TvZ & PvP & PvZ & ZvZ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\#Replays & 4897 & 7894 & 9996 & 4334 & 6509 & 2989 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\textbf{The number of replays after applying our pipeline.}}\n\\label{table:replays}\n\\end{table}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsection{Preprocessing}\nThere are 64396 replays in SC2LE, which could be split into 6 groups according to the races in the matches.\nTo ensure the quality of the replays in our dataset, we drop out all the replays dissatisfying the criteria:\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item Total frames of a match must be greater than 10000.\n \\item The APM (Actions Per Minute) of both players must be higher than 10.\n \\item The MMR (Match Making Ratio) of both players must be higher than 1000.\n\\end{itemize}\nBecause low APM means that the player is standing around while low MMR refers to a broken replay or a player who is weak.\n\nAfter applying these criteria, we obtain 36619 high quality replays, which are unbroken and played by relatively professional players.\nThe number of replays in each group after preprocessing is summarized in Table~\\ref{table:replays}.\n% Figure~\\ref{fig:density} shows the densities of APM and MMR among all 4897 replays.\n% Most players' APMs are around 100 while their MMR are roughly 4000.\n% Interestingly, the densities of APM and MMR from winners and losers have similar distribution, which shows that APM and MMR are not the key factors to win a match.\n% \\begin{figure\\*}[t]\n% \\begin{center}\n% \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\linewidth]{images/APM\\_PLOT}\n% \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\linewidth]{images/MMR\\_PLOT}\n% \\end{center}\n% \\caption{\\textbf{Density plots of APM and MMR among all the preprocessed replays.} For APM and MMR, we also plot the densities both from the winners' view and losers' view.

Performing this exercise will teach you to feel the glutes working. Just like the others, it is possible to do this wrong, so make sure you pay close attention.\n1. Find a chair or near-waist-height stable surface to aid in balance. \n2. Find neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. With one hand, place your thumb on the bone on the side of your hip and lay your fingers across the buttock. Apply pressure with the fingers into the muscle of the buttock.\n4. Slowly and carefully extend your leg backward, pushing through the heel. Feel the glutes engage beneath your fingers while the leg moves backward. This is what we are going for in the quadruped hip extension.\n5. Do ten to twelve repetitions. Do two to three sets, with three being the goal. Focus on activation of the gluteal muscles.\n\n6. Once this exercise becomes easy and you feel the glutes working, go back and try the quadruped hip extension.\n7. If you are unable to feel the glutes working after several tries, read the trigger point chapter (Chapter 14), and then come back and try again. \nPART THREE: LEARNING TO USE THE GLUTES\nThe goal of all of these exercises is to learn to use the glutes at the appropriate times and to build the strength in them to be able to do what\u2019s needed. This next bit teaches you the real day-to-day stuff that is so important. After you\u2019ve built up some strength in those glutes, it\u2019s time to put them to use. \nSquatting \nPay attention! This is the granddaddy of all movements for which you need to use the glutes. Think about the number of times you do some sort of squat in a given day. Getting off the couch, getting off the toilet, getting out of the car; picking up something off the floor. And skiing. On and on. Squatting: Done the wrong way, squatting will cause countless micro aggravations to your back and knees. In geologic time, these can be a major contributor to your hurting back. Done the right way, squatting builds the gluteal muscles and takes the load off the spine and knees. \nTo do squats correctly, it\u2019s easiest to break them down piece by piece. First (carefully and only if you are comfortable with it), do a few squats without any instruction from me. Do ten or twelve of them. What muscle group did you feel working the most? Most of you are going to say the quads (the big muscles on the front of your thighs). Some of you might say the hamstrings, some the knees. Those are all typical responses, which, alas, means you aren\u2019t doing them the proper way. If you said the glutes, you\u2019re a step ahead of everyone.\nIf you are doing a squat the right way, you should feel the glutes working more than the quads, say 60/40 or 70/30. Think of this as a squat back, not a squat down. In other words, you are sticking your buttocks out behind you, not down below you. Let\u2019s break this down into steps. Practice each step several times until you get it.\nSTANCE:\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. This means you should be able to draw an imaginary line straight down from the outside of your shoulder to your outer heels. \n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in place. \n3. Bend your knees very slightly.\n4. Your feet should be pointed mostly forward. Slightly outturned is okay but only a few degrees. Outwardly turned feet (think ballerinas) make gluteal engagement difficult. Just because something is good for a sport or activity like ballet doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for your body. It\u2019s the same with golf: The best golf swing is the worst for your back.\nStep 1\n1. Stick your buttocks back behind you while maintaining a neutral spine as if you were aiming for a chair to sit down on. \n2. At the same time, straighten your arms out in front of you, thumbs pointing up, as a counterbalance. \n\n3. Don\u2019t squat down at all. Just stick your buttocks back without moving your low back. \n\n4. This is called a hip hinge. The axis of movement is at the hips, not in the back.\n5. Practice this several times until you can do it without pain and without moving your back. \nStep 2\n1. Now add just a little bit of squat to it.\n\n2. Bend the knees a little more, which will take your buttocks farther behind you and your body lower to the floor.\n3. Your knees should not come forward\u2014not at all is best but a little is okay. Your lower legs should be perpendicular to the floor.\n4. Go only as low as you can without your knees coming forward. If your back or knees hurt a little bit, hang in there until we get through this. Step 3 will likely take away the knee and back pain. \n5. Practice going up and down a few times, making sure to stick your buttocks back behind you as if you were going to sit in a chair behind you. It\u2019s okay to start with a very small range of motion. \nStep 3\n1. Here\u2019s the crucial and difficult part: activating the glutes as you rise from the squat position.\n2. Squat down as you did in Step 2. Pause at the bottom of the range of motion. \n3. As you start to rise up, push outward on the knees/heels while you bring the hips forward as if you were trying to \u201cspread the floor\u201d apart.

The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released. And don\u2019t forget: Use the pictures as your guide. \nOnce you have a general idea of where the trigger point is, mash away at it, if you like, with your bare hands, and see if that manual manipulation is enough to \u201crelease\u201d the rascal. What you do is hold down hard on the place that hurts the most and\u2014in ten to thirty seconds or so\u2014you should feel an easing of the pain. That is the trigger point letting go. Nice work. If the pain does not ease up after thirty seconds or so, either you are not directly"}, {"Prompt Length": 1967, "Output Length": 30, "prompt": "provide json for answer\nANNA AUGUSTOWSKA 51.0999 17.0299 5812\nAUCHAN POLSKA SP.

For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage. This also sets you up for potential disaster when you stand. Your spine is now unstable and subject to serious damage if you were to lift something heavy before the tissues return to their normal state. This can have even more serious, permanent results. That\u2019s creep, and it is not good."}, {"Prompt Length": 1590, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "recuerda solo contestar OK cuando tengas leidas y analizadas las opiniones, no contestes nada m\u00e1s:\n\n\"Ordered a 30 pack of smoothies. Smoothies came nice, but the bottle didn't come with the order. Emailed them with pictures and receipts only to be told I didn't have enough \"\"proof\"\" that I hadn't received the bottle. I had to make the smoothies in a water bottle for 2 weeks, which was unpleasant and left chunks of powder. Later I contacted them again, and for some reason they said OK and sent me a bottle. Was feeling okay about their customer service until I realized they had charged me for the bottle!!! I should not have been charged as I ordered it in the first place and it was missing---so it is not my fauly I did not receive it.\n\nDisappointed with the service and the smoothies being a little unpleasant to taste, I wanted to cancel, but the Manage Subscription button isn't working either. Contacted support and they said they canceled my subscription. Didn't think much of it until I received ANOTHER receipt saying that I purchased another box!!! I did NOT!!!\n\nRidiculous, and frankly, a quite sneaky website that makes it difficult to cancel your subscription, has awfully bad and unreliable customer service, and has a hard-to-navigate UI as well. I struggled so hard to find the button to cancel my subscription. If anything, that should be the first option when you go into your profile.\"\nThis is truly an amazing product. I notice a better sense of well-being, my skin looks better ( and people ask all the time about what new makeup I'm using). It has helped me change my eating habbits and lose weight. My scale and my blood tests don't lie, in the past six months the needle has moved a more positive direction and the only real change is this and I'm drinking more water. Just that easy. My energy level has come up as well and overall this does the trick. When I get caught out with nothing but fast food surrounding me, the gummys really support me in saying no and sustain me until I get home. I drink one smoothy in the morning ( except sometimes I mix it with oatmeal) and then on mid afternoon when I want to crave a snack. I'm gettimg nutritiom and curbing my eat monster all in one go. I truly cannot say enough good about this product and the price is more than fair ( the money I save from fastfood alone pays for the box).\nI am very happy with the smoothies and the bowls. The bowls are perfect lunch choices for me and everything has so much flavor.\nI love using Kencko, it is a great way to get in the fruits and vegetables that I need in smoothie form, especially as a person who doesn't get in as many as I should.\n\"My husband and I have busy schedules and often work long or odd hours, which means we turn to quick and convenient meal options which aren\u2019t necessarily healthy. We found and started buying Kencko smoothies about 7-8 months ago. We absolutely LOVE them. We drink them mixed with water, juice, milk. We generally start our day off with a smoothie and notice a difference in how we feel if we skip a day. We also like to mix the packets with fresh fruit, juice and ice for additional flavor, but it\u2019s definitely not necessary. There are a few flavors that are difficult to mix, even after breaking product up in the tube prior to mixing with liquid. I just throw it in a blender and all is good. Some of the beet-based and green flavors are too earthy tasting for us, but we love the reds, yellows, purples, golden plum, crimson, peaches, golds and the blush isn\u2019t too earthy.\n\nWe are hooked on Kencko smoothies. Shipping is fast, too and I like the discounts!\"\nLovely products and flavors. The perfect way to get organic fruit and veg in my diet in a convenient and delicious way. As a bonus, it arrived quickly.\ntheir website is full of bugs. it seems nearly a scam .. it's very hard to navigate into the personal account area and impossible to me to cancel the recurring payment. said so many times to them, they are very polite (so fake) and just don't care. the product seems good, even if there is not any evidence or proof or more detail that it's really organic and not some trash.\n\"Regret not reading other reviews first. Blocks of powder refuses to mix. Literally tastes gritty and is straight up a scam.\n\nEdit: Refunded my order and sent pictures to see how they can update their products.\"\nBanging. So yummy and quick to use. I\u2019ve seen complains about them being gritty. While they have a bit of texture it\u2019s no more than a normal smoothie and it\u2019s fibre. The customer service is incredible. They\u2019re were so helpful and went above and beyond to ensure I wasn\u2019t accidentally ordering too much (I accidentally set up multiple subscriptions.) Couldn\u2019t recommend more\n\"HONTEUX !!\nDes voleurs !!\nATTENTION LORS DE VOTRE COMMANDE\nON ME FACTURE \u00c0 NOUVEAU UNE NOUVELLE COMMANDE SANS AVOIR CONTRACT\u00c9 UN QUELCONQUE ABONNEMENT\nREMBOURSEZ MOI !!\nProduits vraiment pas bons\nInutile de r\u00e9pondre par des messages d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout faits d\u2019avance ! Soyez plut\u00f4t effray\u00e9 par tous ces avis n\u00e9gatifs\"\nPossibly the most disgusting drink I have ever tasted they do not mix properly I wish I had read the reviews here before I purchased, extremely overpriced and please be careful it\u2019s not a one off purchase it\u2019s a recurring monthly subscription and it\u2019s very hard to find how to cancel on the account\n\"Very overpriced I cannot believe I wasted over \u20ac60 on these.\nThey tasted vile I felt like vomiting while drinking.\nThey do not mix properly even after shaking for ages.\nThey should have a try before you buy on these even one free sample before people waste that much money.\nDidn\u2019t feel they did anything for me did not feel any more energised only felt out of pocket.\nTrying to log into my account to cancel the subscription was a nightmare.\nNot enough choice of flavours really.\nDefinitely would not buy again.\n\nPros: shipping was fast and the bottle is handy\"\nEverything from the product to packaging and delivery has been perfect :) I can highly recommend this !\nI thought I was rid of my encounters with kencko after I canceled my initial order with them. For context, they never delivered the order and were extremely unhelpful throughout the process. Actually, as of today, the order still says \u201con its way\u201d via the link they provided. To make matters worse, I started receiving promotional materials to my home address asking me to come back to the service. The audacity of this company astounds me - thank goodness I gave my business to one of their competitors.\n\"I've been enjoying Kencko for about 5 months, and it's great! The flavor choices are awesome and help me hit all the nutritional goals! I fell into health issues and was in the hospital for a bit. When i got out I had a month backlog of Kencko with more on the way since I wasn't around to ask it to delay (which is painless and doesn't require fighting customer service, just a simple easy button if you need to). I contacted customer service to explain what happened and within 3 minutes they had halted in the in-progress shipment for me so I could catch up.\n\nWonderful company, and they care!\""}, {"Prompt

Pain and Back Pain\n From Chris and Jeremy\nMost of us\u2014the newcomers anyway\u2014tend to think of back pain as something that is largely in the spine itself. The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released. And don\u2019t forget: Use the pictures as your guide. \nOnce you have a general idea of where the trigger point is, mash away at it, if you like, with your bare hands, and see if that manual manipulation is enough to \u201crelease\u201d the rascal. What you do is hold down hard on the place that hurts the most and\u2014in ten to thirty seconds or so\u2014you should feel an easing of the pain. That is the trigger point letting go. Nice work. If the pain does not ease up after thirty seconds or so, either you are not directly"}, {"Prompt Length": 2390, "Output Length": 20, "prompt": "The Core Knowledge and Competencies are the basis on which are built the program curriculum and learning activities.

Over the past two decades it has become increasingly involved, whether this relates to outright purchases (and more recently disposals), or in terms of using gold to help boost commercial bank liquidity.\n\nGold Reserves\nIn Turkey, the CBRT\u2019s core activities, in terms of its management of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, are guided by Article 53 of the CBRT Law. Specifically for gold, this governs how the Bank may execute forward and/ or spot purchases and sales of gold and lending/borrowing transactions.\n\nUntil September 2011, the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves (as reported to the IMF) had remained essentially flat at 116.1t. Since then, its gross holdings have risen sharply, to reach 716.3t by end-2020. The increase largely reflects the adoption of more gold friendly policies by the Turkish government, which has increasingly promoted the role of gold in the financial system, while at the same time trying to lessen the country\u2019s dependence on the dollar. To help achieve these goals, aside from the CBRT making direct gold purchases from local and international markets, it has increasingly used other tools, including the Gold Monetisation Scheme, the Treasury\u2019s gold bond and gold lease certificate issuances and the CBRT\u2019s gold swaps programme with local commercial banks.\n\n1. CBRT\u2019s Own Reserves\nFocussing on the CBRT\u2019s own reserves, it was not until May 2017 that the central bank started to raise its holdings. In other words, the 320t increase in the CBRT\u2019s gross holdings between October 2011 and April 2017 was driven by the commercial banks\u2019 gold held through the reserve option mechanism (ROM).\n\nFrom 115.8t in April 2017, the CBRT\u2019s own holdings peaked at 440.6t in July 2020. This was followed by a period of disposals during August-December which totalled over 105t, these accounting for the largest share of global central bank sales at that time. This left the CBRT\u2019s own reserves at 334.7t by end-2020. These sales were largely driven by a deteriorating economic backdrop and currency crisis. After Turkish foreign exchange reserves dropped to a multi-decade low over the summer, some gold holdings are believed to have been mobilised to support the lira and/or repay international debt.\n\n2. Treasury\nPart of the growth in the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves also reflected the issuance of gold bonds and lease certificates by the Turkish Treasury, as gold collected via these programmes was transferred to the central bank\u2019s account. In September 2017, the Treasury decided to issue both an interest-bearing gold bond and also a gold sukuk (the Islamic equivalent of a bond, generating a return while still being compliant under Sharia law). Both were sold to the public in return for their physical gold.\n\nUnder this mechanism the public deposited their gold with the state-owned Ziraat Bank and, in return, the Treasury issued a gold bond or sukuk, both of which pay dividends in Turkish lira (TL) at regular intervals. At the point of maturity, investors have had two options. First, they can take back their gold in the form of Republic coins struck by the State Mint, Darphane. Alternatively, these instruments can be sold back before maturity to the Treasury with payment made in TL. Starting with a volume of 1.9t in October 2017 and, with the subsequent involvement of financial institutions, the total amount of these two instruments reached 60t by the end of 2020; with further auctions in 2021 boosting this figure to 94.7t by end-June 2021.\n\nCBRT\u2019s Gross Gold Holdings, by Location (1)\n\nSource: CBRT Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020\n1. All holdings are taken from the CBRT\u2019s Annual Financial Statements without any adjustment\n\n2. The reported CBRT\u2019s own gold includes gold swap with non-official entities. This explains why end-year figure in this table is higher than Metals Focus\u2019 estimate (334.7t at end-2020)\n\n3. Under the Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\n\n3. Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\nThe reserve option mechanism (ROM) has its roots in gold banking\u2019s evolution in Turkey. For many years, this was a niche area in the Turkish financial sector, with only one bank working on Islamic finance principles, Kuveyt Turk Kat\u0131l\u0131m Bankas\u0131, which introduced the first gold account in Turkey. However, there was little other commercial bank involvement until the CBRT started its gold monetisation scheme in 2012 through the ROM. This was first introduced in 2011 and its purpose was communicated by the CBRT as to limit the negative effects of excessive volatility of capital flows on the country\u2019s macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as also boosting the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves.\n\nAfter the gold monetisation scheme was launched, banks started to use the ROM more effectively. Simply put, as part of the ROM banks are allowed to hold a certain ratio of Turkish lira reserve requirements as foreign exchange and/or gold in increasing tranches. This affords an opportunity to use gold as a tool to create more room for lira credit lines. As a result, gold collected through the country\u2019s gold monetisation scheme and through gold banking accounts (offered by Turkish commercial banks) are channelled towards this use.\n\nIn terms of how the ROM applies to gold; since end-2012 and until 3rd October 2016, a maximum of 30% (known as the reserve option coefficient, ROC) of a bank\u2019s reserve liabilities could be offset against gold. This 30% was broken down into three tranches, each involving a different reserve option ratio. For the first 20% bracket, the ratio was set at 1.2, which meant that, for example, TL1.2m of gold was required to free up TL1m of Turkish Lira (TL) reserves. For the next 5% bracket, the ratio rose to 1.7, and for the last 5% the ratio stands at 2.2. The value of the gold is marked-to-market every 15 days.\n\nA new incentive announced by the CBRT on September 1, 2016 defined a further tranche of 5%, in addition to the existing 30% facility. This 5% also featured two new elements. First, it allowed only bullion refined from scrap gold collected by banks from the public after October 3, 2016 to be utilised, and excluded all other bullion from other sources.\n\nSecond, the reserve option ratio will be set to 1, which means there is a one-to-one conversion towards the ROC. The lower ROC suggests that banks will now be incentivised to attract consumer-held gold stocks since other forms of gold, such as metal acquired via electronic purchases, will not qualify.\n\nThis ruling was then amended on 18th January 2020, with the 30% ceiling reduced to 20%. On 24th February 2021, this was again reduced, this time to 15% and the scrap gold related tranche, which was first introduced as 5% and raised to 10% on 16th February 2019, has been further increased to 15%. Under this scheme, commercial banks have been allowed to use gold against a portion of their reserve liabilities. In turn, this encouraged banks to start gold collection days where they bought back gold from the public. Beforehand, gold deposit accounts did not pay interest, but it then became more common to do so, with interest rates peaking at around 2.4% by mid-2018. However, this trend then reversed. Today, interest can range from as low as 0.15% up to 1%, with some commercial banks offering interest-free gold bank accounts. This change reflects the increased reserve requirement ratios, which by 19th November 2020, stood at 18% for maturities of at least one-year and at 22% for lower maturity dates, depending on the bank in question. Furthermore, investor returns are subject to a 15% withholding tax for account holders over a minimum term starting from three to six months.\n\n4. Gold Swaps\nIn May 2019, the CBRT started to use gold swaps as another tool to regulate money supply and manage foreign exchange reserves. Under this new policy, commercial banks can swap a portion of their gold holdings with the CBRT in return for lira and foreign currency or vice versa. Gold swapped under this route will be transferred to the CBRT\u2019s account. To put this new policy into perspective, from 12.3t in May 2019, the total amount of gold swap jumped to 123.5t by end-2020.

Both\nfunctions will be needed when encapsulating and processing RDT packets.\nYou can implement other necessary functions or classes in this component as well.\nPart 2: reliable data transfer sockets\nYou can define class RDTSocket in this component. This class can inherit all the\nmethods and properties from class UnreliableSocket. There are five key functions\nyou need to implement:\n\u2022 accept(): Similar to the accept function defined in TCP protocol, it is invoked\nby the receiver to establish \u2018connections\u2019 with the sender. The return value is\nthe address (tuple of IP and port number) of the sender. You do not need to\ncreate a new connection socket like TCP does.\n\u2022 connect(): Similar to the connect function defined in TCP, it is invoked by\nthe sender to initiate connection request with the receiver.\n\n\u2022 send(): This function is invoked by the sender to transmit data to the receiver.\nThis function should split the input data into appropriately sized chunks of data,\nand append a checksum to each packet. seq\\_num should increment by one for\neach additional segment in a connection. Please use the compute\\_checksum()\nfunction provided in util.py for the 32-bit CRC checksum.\n\u2022 recv(): This function is invoked by the receiver to receive data from the\nsender. This function should reassemble the chunks and pass the message back\nto the application process. Use the verify\\_packet() function to check the\nintegrity of the segments.\n\u2022 close(): This function is invoked by the sender to terminate the connection\nbetween the sender and the receiver.\nWhen implementing send() and recv(), you MUST use the sendto() and recvfrom()\nfunctions defined in the utility file.\nYou will implement reliable transport using a sliding window mechanism. The size of\nthe window (window\\_size) will be specified in the command line. The sender must\naccept cumulative ACK packets from the receiver.\nAfter transferring the entire message, the sender will send an END message to mark the\nend of connection.\nThe sender must ensure reliable data transfer under the following network conditions:\n\u2022 Packet loss;\n\u2022 Reordering of ACK messages;\n\u2022 Duplication of any amount for any packet;\n\u2022 Delay in the arrivals of ACKs.\nTo handle cases where ACK packets are lost, you should implement a 500 ms\nretransmission timer to automatically retransmit segments that were not\nacknowledged. Whenever the window moves forward (i.e., some ACK(s) are received\nand some new packets are sent out), you reset the timer. If after 500 ms the window\nstill has not advanced, you retransmit all segments in the window because they are all\nnever acknowledged (not just the missing segment).\nThe receiver needs to handle only one sender at a time and should ignore START\nmessages while in the middle of an existing connection. It should also calculate the\nchecksum value for the data in each segment it receives with its header information.\n\nIf the calculated checksum value does not match the checksum provided in the\nheader, it should drop the packet (i.e. not send an ACK back to the sender).\nFor each segment received, it sends a cumulative ACK with the seq\\_num it expects to\nreceive next. If it expects a packet of sequence number N, the following two scenarios\nmay occur:\n1. If it receives a packet with seq\\_num not equal to N, it will send back an ACK\nwith seq\\_num=N. Note that this is slightly different from the Go-Back-N\n(GBN) mechanism discussed in class. GBN totally discards out-of-order\npackets, while here the receiver buffers out-of-order packets.\n2. If it receives a packet with seq\\_num=N, it will check for the highest sequence\nnumber (say M) of the in-order packets it has already received and send ACK\nwith seq\\_num=M+1.\nIf the next expected seq\\_num is N, the receiver will drop all packets with seq\\_num\ngreater than or equal to N + window\\_size to maintain a window\\_size window.\nPart 3: a sender and a receiver\nThe sender and receiver application process are programmed with the socket APIs\nimplemented in Part 2. The sender transmits a text file, alice.txt, to the receiver.\nThe receiver will write the received data to file download.txt.\nFor example, the sender can be invoked as follows if Python is used:\npython sender.py [Receiver IP] [Receiver Port] [Window Size]\n\u2022 Receiver IP: The IP address of the host that the receiver is running on.\n\u2022 Receiver Port: The port number on which the receiver is listening.\n\u2022 Window Size: Maximum number of in-flight segments.\nThe receiver can be invoked as follows if Python is used:\npython receiver.py [Receiver Port] [Window Size]\n\u2022 Receiver Port: The port number on which receiver is listening for data.\n\u2022 Window Size: Receiver window size.\n\nTo test your code, you could compare download.txt with alice.txt with the\nfollowing commands:\ndiff download.txt alice.txt\nIf nothing is printed, then your code is correct.\n\nTips\n\no You could assume the communication between the sender and receiver is half-\nduplex, which means that only the sender is allowed to send data to the\n\nreceiver.\no To implement timer, you could calculate the time elapsed between the current\ntime and a previous timestamp. If this value exceeds 500 ms, then a timeout\nevent happens.\no You do not need to consider efficiency when implementing this protocol.

That is, she has not been taking care of herself while she has been taking care of business. She has put on a ton of weight, to begin with, which hasn\u2019t helped. And she has had a lot of pain. Interestingly (and familiarly to me), the fear of its onset has been almost as bad as the pain itself. That hasn\u2019t helped her business either, she says. Like Fit Fred, she reads off the list of things her medical doctor says are wrong with her with something approaching pride. And, sure enough, the list goes on for quite a while.

I ignore that, and tell her to move her legs up and down as if marching in place, bringing the knees up toward the torso. Does this make your back hurt? Of course it does. But\u2014sneaky, I know\u2014she is getting used to the idea that I think it\u2019s going to be possible for her to move in this position, which is true. Okay, I say, let\u2019s lessen the range of motion a lot. Now just barely lift your feet off of the table. Does this make your back hurt? Yes. Growing frustration. \nNow I shift gears and, for the next fifteen minutes, I talk to her about finding her neutral spine. She does. Then I ask her to tighten the muscles in her abdomen, which\u2014God bless her\u2014she finally does. I\u2019m getting off track and talking a bit about the beginning of therapy, I know, but therapy and diagnosis are inseparable in her case. \nThen I have her do the marching in place again, but with those muscles engaged. Does that hurt? \u201cNo,\u201d she says with surprise. And darned if she doesn\u2019t brighten a little. A wisp of pleasure or relief comes across her face. Huh! \nI tell her that she has just crossed the Rubicon. We have begun on the road to a cure. It is going to be long and hard, but my guess is that we are going to get there. \u201cYeah?\u201d she asks, not daring to believe it. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cI believe we are. No guarantees and a lot of work for you. But my guess is that you\u2019ve been a worker all your life, that you\u2019ll work at this and that you will make it. Yes.\u201d She is plenty skeptical, but she smiles, too. \nI explain that if she can move her legs without pain in her back while lying down then she can eventually do it upright. And that is called walking. It has been a while since she was able to walk without pain, and there have been plenty of days when she couldn\u2019t walk at all. I push her to do a little more, but that little march is all she can do for now. Fine, that\u2019s where we start. \nThere can be a serious, psychological component in all this, and it was very serious indeed with Sally. She had become deeply scared of movement. Any and all movement because any movement hurts. Her default solution has been not to move at all. Worse than that, her real solution in recent times has been to sit on the sofa and drink quite a bit of white wine. It worked, in a way, but was disastrous, too. It has given her this hideous weight problem. It hasn\u2019t made her very good company, and it has been brutal for her business. But she didn\u2019t hurt when doing that. So she sat on the couch for many hours a day, doing some business and quite a lot of drinking. My complicated task\u2014and the book may not be much help on this one\u2014was to wean her from the sofa-and-wine solution and get her into the movement solution. I was cautiously optimistic. Justifiably optimistic, it turns out. She is a proud woman and had a right to be. I thought that that fact and the early easing of pain just might do the job.\nSally and I have been at it for six months and she has done remarkably well. We are not there yet, but she has made terrific progress, her spirits are much improved, and her drinking much abated. Six months into our work, she is walking with her spouse around the neighborhood at night without much pain. She is playing with her grandchildren. She is going to the movies. She goes to the office rather than having everything brought to her at home. And she is doing serious (for her) strength training! She sees all this as a near-miracle and is charmingly grateful. Is she totally pain-free? No. She may never be. Does she have her life back? Yes, quite a bit of it, anyway. I want to see her make more progress. She thinks what has happened thus far is extraordinary.\nTHE GATEWAY THEORY OF PAIN \nHere is a little anecdote about the walking-in-place solution with which so many cures begin. A big reason for the reduction of pain is that tensing the abdominal muscles in the right way keeps the spine from moving and causing irritation. But, another reason is that it is a simple distraction from pain, to get the patient to focus on movement. We have gateways or pathways over which pain moves to the brain, and they have a limited capacity. One of the things about the walking-in-place phenomenon is that the \u201creports\u201d of this activity to the brain take up a fair amount of neural space and block the gateways. There is less room for the pain reports to get through. So they don\u2019t. Some do, of course, but fewer. Thus, the simple business of walking-in-place, which serves many functions, blocks the pain highway and lessens the sense of pain. Sounds trifling but it works. It\u2019s like the nurse pinching the spot where she\u2019s going to give you the shot: she wants to keep you busy. Your neural pathways, anyway.\nRegular Robert \nOn the fitness scale, Regular Robert was somewhere in the middle. In terms of his lifestyle and temperament, he was a lunatic. Like a lot of my patients here in Aspen, he is successful, a strong alpha personality, a serious workaholic, and a handful. He thinks he\u2019s a fitness guy but his idea of fitness is getting on the treadmill for forty-five minutes a day while reading his emails. This is not my idea of fitness; this is my idea of fooling around. And it is largely useless for someone with real back issues. The rest of his day is spent in intense meetings, traveling, and (especially) bent over his computer. Recently, he has had a relatively sudden onset of pretty serious lower back and buttock pain. It is nowhere near as severe as what I had or what most of the other people in this chapter had, but it\u2019s serious enough, and he\u2019s not liking it one bit. So here he sits, in my office, looking cranky. Everyone I see looks cranky. \nI listen to his story and determine it is likely a bulging lumbar disc. Do you remember those terms? Lumbar means lower back, where almost all back pain resides. And a disc is a disc. The reasons behind my conclusion are fairly straightforward and you can probably follow the analysis yourself, if you have similar problems. By asking him to move some, I find that he gets more pain with flexion (forward bending at the waist), sitting, and lifting. The pain eases with standing, extension (backward bending at the waist), and moving. The pain radiates down into his buttocks and can go from severe to almost nonexistent in the same day. The pain is more severe in the back than in the buttock or leg. I believe that it is a bulge (the outer fibers of the disc are still mostly intact) and not a herniation or rupture because the pain would be more severe if it were a rupture, and it would likely be radiating down his leg. \nThe pain is positional, meaning it gets better or worse depending on the position he is in. The pain goes from fairly intense to fairly mild, sometimes within hours, and he is not complaining of any numbness in his leg or foot. When the disc is herniated, it is common for the pain to be constant regardless of position and there is apt to be accompanying numbness or tingling in the foot or leg. The pain is also commonly the most intense in the leg or foot and not the back. I tell him I think he has a bulging disc and I explain just what that means. Type A guy that he is, he immediately wants to talk about surgery\u2014about getting this fixed! Right now. \u201cHow bad is the surgery? How long is the recovery?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho should I use and how soon can I schedule it?\u201d \nI tell him to chill for a minute; we are nowhere near that point yet. There are various stages of disc dysfunction, I tell him, and his does not look that bad to me. I say this because my exam shows no neurological damage. Here\u2019s what I mean. I tapped his Achilles tendon and his foot jerked sharply, a sign that there has been no nerve damage in that area. I do the same with his knee (the same spot your doctor taps when you have a physical): same result. His reflexes are normal, so likely no nerve damage. His strength is within normal range, too. \nIf you have even a hint of \u201cradicular\u201d pain\u2014pain that goes down your leg\u2014you should see a medical doctor. It could be pain from an irritated nerve root (which can be serious) or it could be referred muscular pain. The analysis is a bit too complicated to cover in a book. In any event, I conclude that Regular Robert has not suffered any motor nerve damage because of nerve compression and he has not suffered any loss of strength. In the absence of serious motor function or nerve loss, surgery is seldom called for. \nLet me repeat this: Self-assessment gets tricky when it comes to muscle and nerve loss. If you sense that you are anywhere near that territory, especially if you have possible radicular pain (pain going down your leg), you should get professional help, probably a medical doctor. \nRegular Robert does not have nerve or muscle loss so he is not likely to have suffered a herniation. He is lucky, in a way, to have come in with this problem at this stage. It will give him a not-so-gentle kick in the pants to take spine health seriously. And it will give me a chance to offer him major relief, if not an outright cure. If he is serious and does what he must."}, {"Prompt Length": 1878, "Output Length": 11, "prompt": "CHAPTER FIVE\n RULE #1\n Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\n From Jeremy\nNow we are down to the nuts and bolts of what I do for my patients in the office and what I am going to do for you in this book. For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage. This also sets you up for potential disaster when you stand. Your spine is now unstable and subject to serious damage if you were to lift something heavy before the tissues return to their normal state. This can have even more serious, permanent results. That\u2019s creep, and it is not good."}, {"Prompt Length": 1405, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "Can you modify the following code in MATLAB:\n\n% What the programs do:\n%\n% - Find threshold for given productivity\n\nclearvars;

Pyszczynski et al., 1990). \nMany of the studies showing that MS increases self-esteem striving indicate that how one does that depends on the culturally-valued kinds of behaviors in which a given individual has invested their self-esteem. For example, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al. (1999) showed that MS increased bold driving among Israeli soldiers who based their self-worth partly on driving skill, but did not do so for soldiers who did not base self-worth partly on their driving skill. Zestcott et al. (2016) considered that if people can attain self-esteem through sports, and MS motivates people to increase strivings for self-esteem, then people who value sports and care about their performance may try to improve their performance more when primed with death. In support of this hypothesis, the researchers chose only (male) participants who valued their basketball playing ability and found that death primes (compared to neutral primes) improved their performance in a \u201cone-on-one\u201d basketball game against a research confederate (Study 1) and led to higher scores in a one-minute basketball shooting task (Study 2). Furthermore, in the shooting task study, the researchers also used a mediational analysis to demonstrate that the improvement in the shooting task following death primes was associated with increased task-related self-esteem (satisfaction with themselves). This analysis indicated that death primes did not directly increase selfesteem, but that there was a positive indirect effect of death primes on task related self-esteem though improved performance in the task (only those who actually improved benefited). \nPeople may also attain self-esteem by strengthening their identification with successful groups and \u201cbasking in their reflected glory\u201d (e.g., Cialdini et al., 1976). Studies in the framework of TMT indicate that after MS, people are more likely to identify themselves with and defend their in-groups (e.g., Castano et al., 2003; Greenberg et al., 1990), especially when their groups are perceived as having high collective continuity or \u201ctemporal endurance\u201d (Sani et al., 2009; Smeekes & Verkuyten, 2013). Lifshin et al. (2017) found that American college students who experience the death of a close other are more likely to care about their national identity and rate it as important to them, and that such increased identification is associated with a slightly higher level of self-esteem. Aside from increasing self-esteem by living up to cultural standards and values, people also try to maintain their self-esteem after MS by distancing themselves from groups when such identification might risk their sense of self-worth (Arndt et al., 2002). Nevertheless, because self-esteem is ultimately dependent on the integrity of cultural worldviews, which provide individuals with avenues for attaining immortality, self-enhancement might only be a desired avenue for terror management strategy if it does not challenge important aspects of the cultural worldview (e.g., Landau et al., 2009). \nThe MS hypothesis has been supported by research that experimentally manipulated death primes in randomized experimental and field settings. These primes can be manipulated in a number of ways, including open-ended questions about death, subliminal (below conscious perception) or subtle priming of death-related words or images, search puzzles containing death-related words, images or reminders of terrorism or natural catastrophes, proximity to cemeteries, T-shirts with an image of a skull, and more (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2014). Although various types of threats other than death, such as feelings of uncertainty, loss of control, or general anxiety, may also induce defenses, most of the studies testing the MS hypothesis found that the effects of thinking about death and mortality are different from the effects of other aversive subjects (e.g., Greenberg et al., 1994; Martens et al., 2011; Pyszczynski et al., 2006; for a review, see Hart, 2019). Importantly, TMT research indicates that the effects of MS operate in a two-stage process (Pyszczynski et al., 1999; Greenberg et al., 1994). First, death related cognitions are pushed outside of focal attention using \u201cproximal defenses\u201d such as denial or rationalization (\u201cnot me, not now\u201d). These suppressed death thoughts are nevertheless still cognitively accessible outside of conscious awareness, creating the potential for death anxiety. At this point, \u201cdistal defenses\u201d that bestow people with psychological security, such as self-esteem striving, operate to manage this potential and keep death-related anxiety at bay (e.g., Arndt et al., 1997). \nThe Anxiety-Buffer Hypothesis \n \nThe anxiety-buffer hypothesis states that \u201cif a psychological structure [e.g., self-esteem] provides protection against anxiety, then augmenting that structure should reduce anxiety in response to subsequent threat\u201d (Greenberg et al., 1997, p. 72). Stated differently, if self-esteem protects people from anxiety, then bolstering or affirming self-esteem should reduce anxiety and mitigate other forms of defensiveness. \nMany studies have found correlational evidence for the anxiety buffering function of self-esteem, indicating that low self-esteem (as measured by self-report) is typically associated with higher anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (e.g., Higgins, 1987; Lipsitt, 1958; Rosenberg, 1962; Rosenberg & Simmons, 1972; for a meta-analysis, see Sowislo & Orth, 2013). However, to know if self-esteem actually causes decreased anxiety after threat, one would need to experimentally manipulate increased self-esteem, and then measure its protective capacity. \nIn the first experiment testing this hypothesis, Greenberg et al. (1992) increased participants\u2019 self-esteem by providing them with fake feedback about their personality that was either positive (\u201cWhile you may feel that you have some personality weaknesses, your personality is fundamentally strong\u201d) or neutral (\u201cWhile you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them\u201d), and then exposed them to highly-graphic images of death (Study 1), or had them anticipating a mild electric shock (Studies 2 and 3). In line with the anxiety-buffer hypothesis, participants who received the self-esteem boost reported lower levels of self-reported state-anxiety in Study 1, and had reduced physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance response) while anticipating painful shocks in Studies 2 and 3. More recent research has shown that MS increases death anxiety and other negative emotional states in low self-esteem but not high self-esteem individuals (Abeyta et al., 2014; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012; Routledge et al., 2010; for a review, see Juhl and Routledge, 2016). \nBeyond reducing conscious feelings of anxiety, increased self-esteem has also been found to mitigate the effect of MS on distal defenses such as worldview defense and self-esteem striving. Harmon-Jones et al. (1997) demonstrated that providing American students with bogus positive feedback (as compared to neutral feedback) moderated the degree to which MS increased their defense of America (pro-U.S. bias) compared to the control condition. Although students in the neutral feedback condition had elevated pro-U.S. bias after thinking about death compared to after thinking about a control topic (watching television), there was no difference in pro-U.S. bias between the MS and control group among students who received positive feedback about their personality (self-esteem boost). Thus, the increase in self-esteem had provided them a sense of psychological security and reduced their need to further attain protection by defending their cultural worldview. Other studies have since replicated the moderating effect that self-esteem enhancement has on MS-related responses (e.g., Schmeichel & Martens, 2005). For example, in regard to self-esteem striving, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al. (1999) showed that although MS increased driving speed among Israeli soldiers who perceived driving as relevant to their self-esteem, this effect was eliminated if participants were first provided with (fake) positive personality feedback. \nStudies also show that dispositionally high self-esteem (i.e., traitlevel self-esteem) can also sometimes moderate the effect of MS on human thought and behavior (e.g., Harmon-Jones et al., 1997). However, high trait self-esteem has also been found to have opposite effects in some contexts, such as increased defensiveness in certain situations (e.g., Baldwin & Wesley, 1996; Landau & Greenberg, 2006; McGregor et al., 2007). One explanation for this inconsistency is that the ability of selfesteem to provide assuaging psychological protection might depend on more nuanced distinctions between different kinds of high self-esteem. For example, studies by Schmeichel et al. (2009) demonstrated that implicit high self-esteem (a more unconscious sense of self-worth), measured by implicit association tasks, provides stronger defense against MS compared to explicit self-esteem (conscious evaluations of selfworth), measured \""}, {"Prompt Length": 3246, "Output Length": 17, "prompt": "21\nTHE ANSWER IS D.

Of the primary determinants of health, biological factors are the hardest to change. Genetic engineering may someday enable the deactivation of the BRCA1 gene (a gene linked to development of breast cancer), but not today. The other choices represent social factors, and although they may be difficult to change, they are not currently impossible. (REF: 1.2.1 - Determinants of health)\n26\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Process maps are a visual depiction of a process which easily shows which tasks depend on which. Tasks which do not depend on each other can potentially be run in parallel. Culling outliers from a dataset is a statistical process and probably not relevant to workflow analysis. When a new workflow is created, it may cause workers to expand their scope of practice. Similarly, workflow analysis often involves collecting paper forms, but neither of these processes enable parallelization. (REF 2.3.1. Methods of workflow analysis)\n27\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Hick\u2019s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the time required to make a decision is logarithmically related to the number of choices available. If we decrease the number of menu options, we can expect to decrease the amount of time the uses spends deciding which option to pick. Distributed cognition is a theory which states that decisions are not made solely by the individual. Instead, they are distributed across objects, individuals, artefacts, and tools in the environment. Fitt\u2019s law states that the time required to click a mouse on a screen item is related to the size of the item and the distance the mouse has to travel. Norman\u2019s theory of Action specifies seven items that must occur sequentially for an action to be performed: 1. Forming the goal; 2. Forming the intention; 3. Specifying an action; 4.

Workflow reengineering involves changing the way a company works in order to be more efficient. Revising a clinical guideline is analogous to workflow reengineering. Six-sigma is a quality improvement framework that seeks to reduce failure to very low levels (about 3 per million). Reduction in clinical staff and replacing paper forms with electronic equivalents both may be a part of workflow reengineering, but not always. (REF: Section 2.3.2.

The Joint Commission is a quasi-governmental organization which inspects and certifies hospitals. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n34\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Defensive medicine is the practice of ordering low-yield tests in an attempt to decrease risk of future litigation. There are many other reasons why doctors order tests that they expect to contribute little to the diagnostic process, such as choices C and D, but these are not defensive medicine. The fiduciary relationship would be best honored by acting in the client\u2019s best interest, which is usually at odds with defensive medicine.

Computer competency is the ability to perform basic computer functions. A controlled vocabulary is a set of concepts in a particular domain. Informatics management is the process of collecting data, analyzing it and distributing the findings. (REF: 1.1.2 - Key informatics concepts, models, and theories)\n36\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Image compression may decrease the network overhead of sharing pictures, but the other choices more directly affect interoperability. Shared terminologies and common data definitions are more or less the same concept. Protocols are the mechanisms by which data is moved from one place to another. (REF: 3.4.2 Data standards and sharing)\n37\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Research has shown that CPGs have the potential to reduce inappropriate practice variation, enhance translation of research into practice, and improve healthcare quality and safety. They may decrease the cost of care, but they may also increase the cost of care by recommending more interventions. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n38\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical guidelines are recommendations only and do not include hard and fast rules for treating patients. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n39\nTHE ANSWER IS B. In a Standard Gamble,\u00a0 a patient is asked to choose between a certain time in state of illness vs. therapy with a known risk of cure or death. The standard gamble is defined as one minus the risk of death at the point of indifference ( the point at which the patient cannot choose between treatment options). In a Time Trade-off, a patient is asked to choose between some time in a state of illness vs. some time in a state of perfect health. When using a visual analog scale, patients are asked to rate different health states on a scale where 0 = death\u00a0 and 100 = perfect health. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a measure of the value of health outcomes. (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n40\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Whenever possible, a clinical information system should be evaluated on the basis of clinically relevant outcomes, such as compliance with national guidelines or mortality. The other measures are important, but none are as valuable as a clinical improvement. (REF: 3.5.6 - clinical information system evaluation)\n41\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Preventive maintenance (PM) is any activity designed to prevent failure of a system. Making backups, checking log files, ensuring drive capacity are all PM tasks. Disaster recovery and replacing a broken printer are corrective actions, not preventive. Upgrading monitors is a form of enhancement, not prevention. (REF: 3.5.5 - Clinical information system maintenance)\n42\nTHE ANSWER IS D. As medical records transitioned from paper to electronic formats, it became much easier to extract information from the chart for use in research activities.\u00a0 The other choices reflect clinical benefits. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges) \n43\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a software vendor and consumer which describes the level of technical support to which the consumer is entitled. Effectively, this process shifts the risk of maintaining and supporting the software from the consumer to the vendor. A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is an agreement between a holder of protected health information and one of its business associates regarding the usage and dissemination of data. An End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) is an agreement between a software publisher and the end user, and most commonly exists to limit the user\u2019s ability to modify or resell the software and to disclaim responsibility from the publisher should the software malfunction. Open source software is distributed in an easily modifiable form, often for free. In general, open source software transfers all responsibilities from the publisher to the user, not the other way around. (REF: 3.5.1 - Institutional Governance)\n44\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Six-sigma is named because it seeks to minimize defects until they are six standard deviations from the mean. Although having zero defects would be ideal, C is a better answer because it is closer to 3.4 per million opportunities. The other choices are to high. (REF 2.3.3 Quality Improvement)\n45\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Accepting the current level of risk without attempting any other risk modification is called Risk Acceptance. Risk exploitation is an approach to positive risk where a risk manager does everything in his power to ensure that the risk occurs. Risk transference is when the risk is transferred to another entity, such as buying insurance. Finally, Risk Avoidance involves instituting systematic changes to ensure that the risk does not occur. In the case of cancer, this is not a valid response. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n46\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Integrated change control is a rigorous process to determine the need for changes in the scope of a project. It may involve a single individual or a committee or a change control board. Having a solid change process limits scope creep. Risk avoidance is a response to risk which seeks to avoid the risk entirely. The opposite of risk avoidance is risk exploitation, which seeks to ensure that the risk occurs. A run chart shows the output of a process over time. A sensitivity analysis relies on a mathematical model of a process. By changing input variables, one can predict how the process will turn out.\u00a0 (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n47\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Adverse clinical events are the worst-case scenario for a poorly designed system. In general, the other choices are good outcomes. (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n48\nTHE ANSWER IS D. In an ontology the relationships between terms define those terms, and are therefore explicitly stated. Synonyms (aliases) are a type of relation and must be explicitly stated. Ontological relations are quite varied and are not limited to parent-child relationships. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n49\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. In this case, \u2028\u2028 R = 2 / (1+2) = 66% (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n50\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The discount rate indicates the interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. After one year, the $100 would increase by 10% to $110. After two years, it would increase by another 10%, to $121.

The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released. And don\u2019t forget: Use the pictures as your guide. \nOnce you have a general idea of where the trigger point is, mash away at it, if you like, with your bare hands, and see if that manual manipulation is enough to \u201crelease\u201d the rascal. What you do is hold down hard on the place that hurts the most and\u2014in ten to thirty seconds or so\u2014you should feel an easing of the pain. That is the trigger point letting go. Nice work. If the pain does not ease up after thirty seconds or so, either you are not directly"}, {"Prompt Length": 1900, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER SIX\n Geologic Forces\n From Chris\nWe have talked about a lot of specifics.

And the only way you\u2019re really going to heal your back and avoid long-term pain is to address these mega-forces at the root of your problems. \nTo open your head to the kind of thing we are talking about, think for a minute about the geologic forces that shape continents and tear mountains down to rubble. It\u2019s astonishing, really: Relatively minor pressures, like rain and wind and a succession of freezes, literally tear down mountains. It\u2019s hard to believe but undeniably true\u2014hard to believe because those forces are so relatively trivial, compared to the strength of mountains. And yet, over time, they prevail. \nSo what? Well, our bodies, and especially our backs, are like that, too. Relatively minor behaviors\u2014sitting carelessly at your computer, picking up heavy stuff with a bowed back, standing around with your head projected forward\u2014have no impact at all, the first time. Or over a period of months, or years. Kids get away with lousy posture for a long time. But time and pressure always win. Over time\u2014decades, say\u2014the pressure on your back from hunching over your computer raises hell with your back. Over time, those trifling pressures from picking things up incorrectly will have you rolling on the floor. Time and pressure, \u201cgeologic pressure\u201d on your spine, tears you down. \nOnce you get your head around that concept, you might think that we are all doomed, regardless of what we do\u2014that the pressure of gravity alone, over decades, is going to wreck our backs no matter what. But here is the interesting thing: That\u2019s not true. Used correctly, your body and especially your spine are built to stand up nicely to, say, 90 or even 100 years of relentless gravity and other \u201cgeological\u201d pressures. Stand and move correctly\u2014which is to say, with a neutral spine\u2014and take effective steps to keep the core that holds your neutral spine in place strong, and your back will last a hundred years. That is a slightly amazing\u2014and hugely hopeful\u2014thing. Do stuff that\u2019s within your control\u2014maintain a neutral spine, keep your core strong, and don\u2019t be stupid\u2014and you can withstand those geological pressures for a lifetime. \nAs long as we\u2019re focused on the big picture, let\u2019s recognize that we are talking about two (or more) basic types of pressure on our bodies. There\u2019s plain old gravity, which accounts for a lot. But there is also the pressure of movement. And especially regular, repetitive movement. I am talking about how we stand up or squat, how we pick things up off the floor or from the shelf. I am talking especially about the basic flexion, extension, and rotational movements, like when we swing around to reach something beside and below or above us. Or, say, how we serve in tennis. Or hit a golf ball. And\u2014for you good kids who do serious strength training\u2014how we actually pick up a set of weights, off the floor . . . do a sit-up or a plank.\nAnd here\u2019s a basic insight: Gravity alone can raise holy hell with your back, if your posture is rotten. But the real killer is movement. Especially what we think of as \u201cloaded\u201d movement. By \u201cloaded\u201d we mean anything in addition to body weight, such as picking things up or lifting weights. It\u2019s bad, for example, to twist around to pick something light off the ground if you rotate with your lower back instead of your rotating with your hips. But if you\u2019re picking something up that weighs twenty or thirty pounds or more, the potential for harm goes up geometrically. Then add repetition and time\u2014because you do this exercise \u201cwrong\u201d two days a week at the gym\u2014then the potential for harm is enormous. Basic tip: Doing strength training \u201cwrong\u201d is much, much worse than not doing it at all. Some of the saddest people Jeremy, Bill, and I see\u2014and we see them all the time\u2014are older men and women who have been serious weight lifters for years who have been doing it wrong. And who now can barely move in an athletic or real-world way. And this is true even though they have biceps the size of softballs and quads that are scary. They can\u2019t move! Because they have been moving wrong, heavily loaded, all their lives. Their backs are a mess, as are most of their joints; the small muscles, which weight machines do not work, have atrophied. Bill and Jeremy have saved such folks, but it can take years of corrective exercises. \nCorrect and Incorrect Lifting \n\nA B\nLet\u2019s look at just a few movements or postures that cause problems, and then think of them in \u201cgeologic\u201d time. (In human terms, again, that means decades.) Take a couple of simple examples (see the illustration on this page): Look at the woman in picture A, on the left. She is picking up a substantial weight, but she has good posture, including a neutral spine. And, while you can\u2019t see it, you can assume that she has \u201clocked down\u201d her core to safeguard her back before she started this exercise. And her core is strong. As she rises from this position, the glutes are going to do a lot of the work, which is good. That\u2019s what they are for. The pressures of the lift are spread evenly across the various muscles of the core and the surface of her vertebrae. She can lift weights like this\u2014assuming that she is sane about how much weight and how many reps she does\u2014for the rest of her life and do just fine. \nNow look at the poor person in picture B. She is just as well intentioned, and is picking up roughly the same amount of weight as the woman in picture A. But she is basically doomed. Because she is doing it with a bowed back. The pressures of the lift are directed through the spine and all on the edges. The pressure is concentrated on the edge of the disc and the vertebrae. Two things about these women. First, the woman with the neutral spine can bear 40 percent more weight than the other woman (assuming the two have identical strength and fitness). That\u2019s a big deal. And it\u2019s interesting: Every Olympic or otherwise serious lifter knows this and is meticulous about a neutral spine. Amateurs like you and I . . . less clear. \nBut the really big deal is what happens over time to the two of them. The woman who is lifting wrong (with a bowed back) is putting horrendously more pressure on the edges of the vertebrae and discs in her spine, and they will go bad, dramatically, in time. The other woman . . . no problem.\nThat was a dramatic example. But much less extreme behaviors, repeated over a long enough time, will have just as hellish an impact on you. Think about the basic and most common behavior, which we have talked about so much: lolling at your computer. That does not put nearly as much bad pressure on your back as weightlifting incorrectly. But time is a fine stand-in for weight. Do this behavior over a long span of time\u2014as you now know\u2014and you will make just as bad a mess of your back as bad lifting. Think, again, of geologic pressure. Gentle rains take longer to erode than hurricanes. But eventually the pressures are the same, and the mountain will come down. It\u2019s the same with you: Do dumb stuff long enough, and you will be rolling on the floor. Awful. \nDo you have to be an idiot to engage in behaviors that get you in a jam? Obviously not. All of us sit carelessly at our computers more than we should. Including\u2014in one embarrassing case I personally know about\u2014a back-care professional whose initials are J-e-r-e-m-y J-a-m-e-s! And bear in mind that there are other bad \u201cbehaviors\u201d so subtle that no one is going to focus on them. Think about this one: You have a touch of arthritis in one foot and it hurts, ever so slightly, at every step. Without even thinking about it you make a tiny adjustment in the way you walk, and it helps a lot. Trouble is, that tiny change also included a tiny change in the way you work your hip, and that little change was serious. You start to walk slightly differently, and now you are putting unhealthy stresses through your lower back. This is one of the most common ways to get your back misaligned, other than bad posture. Over time\u2014over geologic time\u2014that heedless adjustment of your foot and then your hip is going to bring you down.

For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage. This also sets you up for potential disaster when you stand. Your spine is now unstable and subject to serious damage if you were to lift something heavy before the tissues return to their normal state. This can have even more serious, permanent results. That\u2019s creep, and it is not good."}, {"Prompt Length": 1104, "Output Length": 799, "prompt": "Web search results:\n\n[1] \"The first thing you need is a board with an ESP32 chip.

Think about what would happen if the danger existed in the world but the PCs didn\u2019t\u2014if all these awful things you\u2019ve conjured up had their run of the world. Scary, huh? The grim portents are your way to codify the plans and machinations of your dangers. A grim portent can be a single interesting event or a chain of steps. When you\u2019re not sure what to do next, push your danger towards resolving a grim portent.\n\nMore often than not grim portents have a logical order. The orcs tear down the city only after the peace talks fail, for example. A simple front will progress from bad to worse to much worse in a clear path forward. Sometimes, grim portents are unconnected pathways to the impending doom. The early manifestations of danger might not all be related. It\u2019s up to you to decide how complex your front will be. Whenever a danger comes to pass, check the other dangers in the front. In a complex front, you may need to cross off or alter the grim portents. That\u2019s fine, you\u2019re allowed. Keep scale in mind, too. Grim portents don\u2019t all have to be world-shaking. They can simply represent a change in direction for a danger. Some new way for it to cause trouble in the world.\n\nThink of your grim portents as possible moves waiting in the wings. When the time is right, unleash them on the world.\n\nWhen a grim portent comes to pass, check it off\u2014the prophecy has come true! A grim portent that has come to pass might have ramifications for your other fronts, too. Have a quick look when your players aren\u2019t demanding your attention and feel free to make changes. One small grim portent may resound across the whole campaign in subtle ways.\n\nYou can advance a grim portent descriptively or prescriptively. Descriptively means that you\u2019ve seen the change happen during play, so you mark it off. Maybe the players sided with the goblin tribes against their lizardman enemies\u2014now the goblins control the tunnels. Lo and behold, this was the next step in a grim portent. Prescriptive is when, due to a failed player move or a golden opportunity, you advance the grim portent as your hard move.

Team and Organizational Update \n\n \nThe past few months were challenging as we spent an unexpected amount of time fixing breakages in unfamiliar systems and felt the loss of our departed colleagues. Despite these difficulties, we successfully delivered on our business goals achieving +16.88% iOPS vs OP2, +35.11% net CCP vs OP2. For OP2, we focused on the LP\u202f\u201cinvent and simplify\u201d to maintain customer obsession as we rebuilt our roadmap. We pooled engineering resources between Paid and Earned to avoid being constrained by preassigned org structure, and selected initiatives that were best for Amazon across both teams. Rather than just drawing a new cutline based on fewer resources (which could have significantly reduced morale), we analyzed each initiative line-by-line and task-by-task, exploring creative solutions with partner teams to combine forces or make ownership adjustments to pick up items falling BTL.\n\n \n\nOne highlight is our collaboration with Social that leverages their loaned headcount to provide TMT customers off-Amazon with the best offerings and most accurate representation of Amazon\u2019s catalog through Data Subscription Service. This service improves the fidelity and accuracy of ASIN attribute data while making access to core advertising product attributes easy for new opportunities to experiment and launch.\u202f \n\n \n\nThe new roadmap led to the reallocation of projects and the shifting of SDEs. For instance, the CN engineering team expanded their scope from supporting only the SEO pipeline to owning Paid initiatives and the Experimentation systems. While the overall PM/engineering management structure remains unchanged, several engineering teams have adopted new charters that will continue to be relevant in the years ahead. \n\n \n\nDespite these improvements, only 22% of our roadmap is dedicated to growth initiatives with 33% of our engineering resources allocated to KTLO and 45% allocated to OE. It was disappointing to cut $389 MM net CCP in projects with approved specs and dedicated owners, but through this process we remained focused on creative problem solving, earned trust, and grew closer as a team. \n4. 2023 Overview \n\n \nIn 2023, we remain dedicated to investing in our long-term vision as outlined in our 3YP. We started with the most business critical projects when drafting our roadmap causing 78% of our engineering resources to be largely dedicated to objective two of our 3YP: \u201cMinimize overhead while developing flexible, resilient software architecture that supports Search Marketing.\u201d These technical investments are 33% KTLO and 45% OE, with our OE initiatives deemed essential re-architecture efforts to reduce the cost to serve and streamline initiatives. Several of our engineering projects nearly pay themselves off in the first year of effort: Project Kondo\u2019s 2023 investment costs 15 eng weeks, but saves us 33 weeks of legacy upkeep and with additional work next year, it is expected to unlock $290M CCP in three years. In addition, Search Marketing Toolkit\u2019s Hydra Migration costs us 70 weeks, but saves 30 weeks in year one and 110 weeks by year three. \n\n \n\nFollowing these must-have investments, the remaining 22% of our roadmap is allocated to ensuring investment in our critical projects, such as Marketing Context Service (MCS) and the integration of Optimal Inventory Health (OIH) signals into our bidder. Through repeated emphasis on invent and simplify, we continue to have the ability to invest in other critical areas of our 3YP such as Experimentation and Profitability, and we are looking for creative solutions to continue progress in BTL items (accounting for $389M CCP) by utilizing an away-team model."}, {"Prompt Length": 1255, "Output Length": 284, "prompt": "Can you rate this code on the following parameters: General Coding Practices, Functional Correctness, Security (exclude overflows), Gas Optimisations, and Code Readability\n1 is the lowest score for a parameter and 5 is the score for a parameter.

My strive for innovation and a craving passion to learn more about computer hardware and electronic designs are reasons why I am aspiring to become an Electrical Engineer. And because of my passion, I believe I can be an effective Student in Human Resources for METROLINX. Being an individual who enjoys working in various environments, I aspire to get involved use my strong analytical, problem solving, and interpersonal skills in METROLINX. As a third-year Electrical Engineering student, I hope to contribute towards the success of METROLINX through my actions, academic knowledge, projects, and my work experiences. \nAs a highly dedicated student that is well- accomplished in the fields of customer service and communication capabilities and proficient to the world of technology and administration, I strongly believe that I will have a positive impact towards your company. This is shown though my 4 years of experience as a Retail Associate at McDonalds, 10+ months of experiences as an Administrative Assistant and Support, and through my previous extracurricular experiences. Working at McDonalds helped me develop my coordination and teamworking skills in a fast- paced work environment. My friendly demeanor, coupled with my multitasking abilities, helped me to communicate with customers effectively while placing their orders and cash handling correctly. Moreover, learning to incorporate my organizational and computational skills as an Administrative Assistant and Support help me familiarize myself with reconciling data and organizing it in MS Excel. I strongly believe that my interpersonal and technical skills make me an ideal candidate for the position of Summer Student in Human Resources at METROLINX.\nMy academic background at Toronto Metropolitan University has been a balanced mix of design projects and theories in which I challenged myself daily to learn about algorithms, data structures, electronics circuit systems and object-oriented engineering analysis and design. During my CPS125 Digital Computation and Programming course, I led a group of 5 students in analyzing and creating unique algorithms to solve large information filling systems problems. I was responsible in facilitating team meetings, completing the final project report, and assisting with research and developing a binary search algorithm to satisfy specific conditions provided by the problem. This 4-week project provided me with the opportunity to work with a group of like-minded individuals and utilize my analytical skills to solve problems and showcase my project management skills. During the quarantine in 2021, I took the initiative to complete the CS50 Series Course by Harvard University to learn various programing languages. Using the knowledge from this course, I was able to develop my own version of Black- Jack, Tic Tac Toe, and Hangman using Java and Python. During the winter 2022 semester, I was able to develop a merge sort algorithm (garbage collection included) with C using the knowledge learned from data structures and linked lists.\nThanks to my academic background in electronics and my hands on experience using lab hardware such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers, knowledge regarding analog/digital circuit analysis, reading schematics, software architecture, design and debugging, concept regarding power and performance are a few things I crave to learn more about. Additionally, being part of Toronto Met Formula Racing gave me an insight into hardware engineering and gaining technical experience by engaging with other sub-team members within the electrical drivetrain sub-team.\nOverall, I am confident that I will easily transition into the Summer Student role for Human Resources and effectively contribute to the team at METROLINX. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you personally and arrange a time to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your time and consideration. You may contact me though my phone number, 647-717-5780 and my personal email, aman.ayaz44@gmail.com. \nJob Description: \n\nTeamwork: You\u2019ll work closely with others and coordinate a portfolio of projects from end-to-end\nProject Coordination \u2013 Support your Project Managers throughout all phases of the project management lifecycle.

It measures the probability that a random paper in one journal has more citations than a random paper in another journal, with 50% indicating that the two journals perform equally well. Unlike the journal impact factor (IF), which is based on the number of citations received by a journal's articles in a given year divided by the total number of articles published in the two preceding years, the citation success index depends on the broadness and the shape of citation distributions. It is a relatively tight function of the ratio of IFs of journals being compared, with the citation success index growing slowly as a function of IF ratio. The lognormal distribution of citation counts is the reason for the relation between Impact Factors and Citation Success Index [[1, 2018, Shen and Wu](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e3cb33e592162e469fd902b47e5ad0c1572080c)].

Everything else stays the same including all the references already used in the following:\n- Compassion fatigue (CF) is a state of physical and mental exhaustion caused by extended exposure to the suffering of patients (P\u00e9rez-Garca et al., 2021). It is an essential issue in nursing because it can affect nurses' well-being, job performance, and quality of patient care (Peters, 2018). In nursing, nurses are supposed to care for patients while preserving their health. However, the high demands and emotional toll of nursing practice can lead to CF (Figley, 2017). Nurses and healthcare professionals in other sectors, such as social work, psychotherapy, counselling, and other caregiving professions, also experience CF (Salmond et al., 2019).\n- Studies indicate that up to 80% of nurses report CF symptoms, indicating that the prevalence of CF among nurses is significant (Xie et al., 2021). The high CF symptoms have important implications for nurses' health and the quality of patient care. Nurses with CF may experience reduced empathy towards patients, which can negatively affect the quality of care provided (Anshel & Kaplowitz, 2018). In addition, nurses with CF may face elevated rates of burnout, depression, anxiety, and physical ailments (Jasper et al., 2016; Kayser-Jones et al., 2018). The negative impacts of CF can lead to poor job performance and a higher risk of turnover, which can negatively impact the healthcare system.\n- CF is also a significant concern regarding nursing staff retention and turnover. Studies indicate that nurses with CF are more likely to abandon the field, resulting in a nursing shortage (Shanafelt et al., 2016). Staff retention and turnover are significant concerns because the need for nurses is rising due to an ageing population and the rise of chronic diseases. In addition, nurses with CF may suffer decreased job satisfaction and engagement, resulting in inferior patient care (Anshel & Kaplowitz, 2018).\n- The emotional and physical long-term effects of CF on nurses have yet to be adequately researched. While studies have indicated that nurses with CF face high rates of burnout, depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms, little is known about CF's long-term mental and physical health effects. This knowledge gap justifies the proposed research question: What are the long-term consequences of CF on the mental and physical health of the UK nursing workforce? \n- In addition to the negative impacts on the well-being of nurses and the quality of patient care, CF can also have financial implications for healthcare organisations. Nurses with CF may require more frequent sick leave, which can lead to increased costs for the organisation. In addition, the high turnover rates of nurses with CF can increase recruitment and training expenses. By preventing and controlling CF, healthcare organisations can improve the well-being of their workforce and the quality of treatment offered and realise long-term cost savings. \n- The proposed research uses a mixed-methods??? approach to examine the long-term effects of CF on the mental and physical health of the nursing workforce in the United Kingdom. It will adhere to the National Health Service (NHS) and Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) ethical criteria (Pehlivan and G\u00fcner, 2020).\n- In addition, the planned research will investigate the causes and effects of CF from the perspective of nurses to better understand the underlying variables that contribute to CF and its influence on the lives of nurses. By understanding the causes and consequences of CF, healthcare organisations and policymakers can develop more effective interventions and policies to support nurses in preventing and managing CF. The findings of this study will also benefit nurses, as it will give them a better understanding of the impact CF has on their well-being and how they can mitigate the effects.\n- The proposed research will contribute to the existing literature on compassion fatigue in nursing by concentrating on CF's long-term mental and physical health effects on the UK nursing workforce. The research results will benefit nursing organisations, policymakers, and nurses in developing effective interventions and policies to support nurses in preventing and managing CF."}, {"Prompt Length": 519, "Output Length": 390, "prompt": "Please take the role of an expert who is a solid academic researcher in the field and also a consultant for industry.

Published in Polymers 2022, 14, 748.\n\nThis is the abstract of the article: \u201cAgroindustrial wastes are a cheap and abundant source of natural fibers and macromolecules that can be used in the manufacturing of biocomposites. This study presents the development and thermo-mechanical characterization of a bio-composite film (TPF/PF), made of thermoplastic banana flour (TPF) matrix and plantain fibers (PF). Fabricated materials were characterized by physical analysis, chemical composition, Fourier-transformed spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA), mechanical analysis, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The physical analysis showed that TPF and PF have a low density and high affinity to water resulting in a lightweight, renewable, and biodegradable TPF/PF composite. The chemical composition and spectra analysis of the fiber showed that PF is a potential candidate for reinforcing composites due to its high \u03b1-cellulose and low lignin content. The thermal analysis determined that TPF degrades at a lower temperature than PF, therefore the matrix sets the processing temperature for TPF/PF composite films. The mechanical test showed an improvement in the tensile properties of the composite in comparison to neat TPF. Tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus were improved by 345% and 1196%, respectively, when PF fibers was used. Good bonding and mechanical interlocking of PF to the TPF were identified by SEM. Therefore, potential biocomposites can be developed using natural fibers and thermoplastic starches obtained from plantain agroindustrial wastes.\u201d\n\nAfter reading the text, please tell me 10

Without immediate and aggressive intervention, he said, \u201clearning loss will be the longest-lasting and most inequitable legacy of the pandemic.\u201d\n\n\"A separate review of test scores from 2.1 million students in the United States highlighted the impacts of economic disparity. Students at schools in communities with high poverty levels spent more of the 2020-2021 school year learning remotely than those at schools in wealthier communities did, and students in poorer schools experienced steeper declines in performance when they were remote.\"\n\n\u201cA kid\u2019s ability to learn and a teacher\u2019s ability to teach are shaped by so many factors beyond just whether they\u2019re physically in the building,\u201d Mr. Reardon said. \u201cIf everyone had fallen behind equally, all at once, it presumably wouldn\u2019t affect your chance of getting into college. But when the effect is differential, that could exacerbate inequality into adulthood for the whole generation. That\u2019s worrisome on a global level.\u201d\n\nAt $611 A Day Per Student, Some Question If L.A. Schools\u2019 Extra Learning Days Are Worth It: Via the LA Times\n\n\"This education booster shot came at considerable expense \u2014 about $611 per day per student for up to two added \u201cacceleration days.\u201d That same cost, multiplied over a 180-day school year, would total about $110,000 per student. By comparison, next year\u2019s record state education funding will provide $23,723 per public school student.\"\n\n\"The bonus schooling on Dec. 19 and 20 cost $36 million. After a heavy promotional push, about 17% of the district\u2019s 422,276 students signed up; however, less than 9%, or 36,486 showed up, according to newly released data.\"\n\n\"Other problems emerged. Some teachers complained they were unable to plan effectively because they did not have advance access to rosters and student data. Under the plan, students were divided by groups into those who needed to catch up and those who would receive enrichment.\"\n\nCovid Research\nAnnual COVID-19 Booster? FDA Cliff Notes: Via Katelyn Jetelina\n\n\"The CDC presented data that is not surprising: most hospitalizations and deaths occur among older adults. Interestingly, children under 6 months are being hospitalized at about the same rates as those aged 50-64 years. This highlights the importance of maternal vaccination during pregnancy.\"\n\n\"The bivalent vaccines are working well. Adults who received a bivalent booster had 3 times lower risk of hospitalization and 2 times lower risk of dying compared to those who were vaccinated but did not get the bivalent booster. Both were more effective than no vaccination.\"\n\n\"Moderna surprised us today with new data, though: a randomized trial in the U.K. They randomly gave people the original vaccine or the bivalent vaccine (BA.1 formula) as a booster. The bivalent vaccine did better. This really put the debate to rest.\"\n\n\"I was excited to see Novavax data. It\u2019s clear this is a solid vaccine. And their presentation was much more useful than Moderna\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s. To demonstrate, they included data on mixing Novavax with mRNA vaccines. It looks like no matter how you mix the two, the combinations work about the same way.\"\n\n\"FDA proposes scientists meet in June for strain selection for a annual September vaccine roll-out. This timeline is possible for mRNA vaccines; not for Novavax. So I\u2019m not sure what FDA is going to do about that.\"\n\n\"A common theme throughout the pandemic FDA meetings is that \u201cit\u2019s too hard to measure anything other than antibodies\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t have the data needed to make a decision.\u201d The FDA could require sponsors to do detailed investigations, e.g. assessing lymph nodes, bone marrow, and breakthroughs. This would help us understand immunity better, so we can make better recommendations. It\u2019s not clear why they aren\u2019t pushing for this.\"\n\nFederal Panel Approves Plans to Safeguard Lab-Made Virus Research: Via Stat.\n\n\"A panel of federal advisers voted unanimously Friday to advance a set of proposals to bolster government oversight of pathogen research that could make viruses more transmissible.\"\n\n\"The panel\u2019s draft report, which recommends safeguards including \u201cfederal department-level review\u201d of gain-of-function studies and implementing a broader definition of pathogens that could potentially cause pandemics, will be finalized, then sent to top National Institutes of Health officials, which currently do not include a permanent NIH director or a replacement for National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci.\"\n\nFacing the New Covid-19 Reality: Via NEJM perspective:\n\n\"Covid-19 has, for many people, become no more than an occasional inconvenience, involving a few days of symptoms and a short isolation period.\" \n\n\"The reality, however, would starkly contradict such a belief. Covid-19 currently results in about 300 to 500 deaths per day in the United States \u2014 equivalent to an annual mortality burden higher than that associated with a bad influenza season.\"\n\n\"In addition, many people continue to face severe short- or long-term Covid-19 illness, including people who lack access to vaccines or treatment and those with underlying conditions that impair their immune response to vaccines or render them especially vulnerable to Covid-associated complications.\"\n\n\"The ever-looming threat of the evolution of a new variant, one that can evade our vaccines and antivirals, remains very real.\"\n\n\"One of the key challenges that the public health community faces as the pandemic evolves is the need to move away from universal recommendations, or population-wide prevention policy, toward a more differentiated or tailored approach \u2014 one that takes into account the characteristics of various communities and the pathogen.\"\n\n\"Most important, attention to the engagement of trusted community leaders and spokespeople is required, as is listening authentically to communities from the start. Rather than focusing solely on what is being recommended, it\u2019s equally important for public health leaders to focus on how recommendations are communicated and disseminated.\""}, {"Prompt Length": 526, "Output Length": 524, "prompt": "Act as a writing assistant.

Lines are collections of points that extend indefinitely in two directions, and can be described using two points or a point and a direction. Planes are flat surfaces that extend indefinitely in all directions.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe distance formula between two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), is given by d = \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). For example, the distance between (2, 3) and (6, 8) is \u221a((6 - 2)^2 + (8 - 3)^2) = \u221a(16 + 25) = \u221a41.\n\nTopic: Angles and Measurement\nExplanation: Angles are formed by two rays that have a common endpoint, called the vertex. Angles can be measured in degrees or radians, with a full circle being 360 degrees or 2\u03c0 radians.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe formula for converting degrees to radians is given by radians = (degrees \\* \u03c0) / 180. For example, 90 degrees is equal to (90 \\* \u03c0) / 180 = \u03c0 / 2 radians.\n\nTopic: Congruent and Similar Figures\nExplanation: Congruent figures are figures that have the same size and shape. Similar figures are figures that have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size.\nFormula and example:\n\nTwo triangles are similar if and only if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding side lengths are proportional. For example, two triangles with angles measuring 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 degrees respectively are similar, even though they are different in size.\n\nTopic: Perimeter, Area, and Volume\nExplanation: Perimeter is the distance around a figure, while area is the measure of the amount of space inside a figure. Volume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional figure.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is given by A = (base \\* height) / 2. For example, the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 7 units is (5 \\* 7) / 2 = 17.5 square units.\n\nTopic: Proofs\nExplanation: Proofs are logical arguments used to establish the truth of mathematical statements. In geometry, proofs often involve using axioms and theorems to deduce new statements about figures.\nFormula and example:\n\nA proof that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nGiven: Triangle ABC\n\nProve: \u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = 180\u00b0\n\nStep 1: Draw a straight line from point A to point C, and label it line segment AC.\nStep 2: Draw a straight line from point C to point B, and label it line segment CB.\nStep 3: Observe that line segments AC and CB form a straight line, meaning that they form a straight angle (180\u00b0).\nStep 4: By definition, the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to the sum of the angles in a straight line (180\u00b0).\nStep 5: Therefore, \u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = \u2220ACB = 180\u00b0, and the proof is complete.\n\nThis is a brief summary of some of the topics typically covered in high school geometry, including points, lines"}, {"Prompt Length": 598, "Output Length": 332, "prompt": "@font-face {\n font-family: \"Fira Code\";\n src: local(\"FiraCode-Regular\"),\n url(\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/firacode/6.2.0/woff2/FiraCode-Regular.woff2\") format(\"woff2\"),\n url(\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/firacode/6.2.0/woff/FiraCode-Regular.woff\") format(\"woff\");\n font-style: normal;\n font-weight: 400;\n }\n @font-face {\n font-family: \"Fira Code\";\n src: local(\"FiraCode-Bold\"),\n url(\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/firacode/6.2.0/woff2/FiraCode-Bold.woff2\") format(\"woff2\"),\n url(\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/firacode/6.2.0/woff/FiraCode-Bold.woff\") format(\"woff\");\n font-style: bold;\n font-weight: 700;\n }\n\n .terminal-1252264801-matrix {\n font-family: Fira Code, monospace;\n font-size: 20px;\n line-height: 24.4px;\n font-variant-east-asian: full-width;\n }\n\n .terminal-1252264801-title {\n font-size: 18px;\n font-weight: bold;\n font-family: arial;\n }\n\n .terminal-1252264801-r1 { fill: #c5c8c6 }\n.terminal-1252264801-r2 { fill: #f8f8f2 }\n.terminal-1252264801-r3 { fill: #75715e }\n.terminal-1252264801-r4 { fill: #66d9ef }\n.terminal-1252264801-r5 { fill: #f92672 }\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT\n\n\nGot\u00a0it!\u00a0Here\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0final\u00a0code\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0user\u00a0input\u00a0section:\n#\u00a0Process\u00a0input\u00a0(events)\nforeventinpygame.event.get():\n#\u00a0Check\u00a0for\u00a0closing\u00a0window\nifevent.type==pygame.QUIT:\nrunning=False\n#\u00a0Check\u00a0for\u00a0user\u00a0input\u00a0(hold\u00a0down\u00a0key)\nifpygame.key.get\\_pressed()[pygame.K\\_UP]:\npaddle\\_b.y-=paddle\\_speed\nifpygame.key.get\\_pressed()[pygame.K\\_DOWN]:\npaddle\\_b.y+=paddle\\_speed\nifpygame.key.get\\_pressed()[pygame.K\\_w]:\npaddle\\_a.y-=paddle\\_speed\nifpygame.key.get\\_pressed()[pygame.K\\_s]:\npaddle\\_a.y+=paddle\\_speed"}, {"Prompt Length": 775, "Output Length": 627, "prompt": "It seems like there is an issue with the mmdevice audio output.

I apologize if I gave the impression that CART is always more accurate than live closed captioning.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that CART services are often provided in more controlled environments, such as classrooms or meetings, where the speaker is typically speaking at a slower pace and the CART provider has a better opportunity to familiarize themselves with the subject matter and vocabulary being used. This can help to improve the accuracy of the captions.\n\nIn addition, CART providers typically work one-on-one with the individual or in small groups, which allows for greater customization and individualization of the captions. The CART provider can work closely with the individual to clarify any confusion or ask for clarification, which can help to improve the accuracy of the captions.\n\nThat being said, the accuracy of both live closed captioning and CART services is largely dependent on the skill and experience of the captioner or CART provider, as well as the quality of the audio and technical equipment being used.

Mindfulness involves being fully present in the moment and non-judgmentally accepting one's thoughts and feelings. It has been found to be effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nIn terms of managing back pain, mindfulness can be especially helpful. Chronic pain often leads to negative thoughts and emotions, which can exacerbate the pain and create a cycle of suffering. By practicing mindfulness, individuals can learn to observe their pain without judgment, allowing them to break free from this cycle and better manage their pain.\n\nOne mindfulness technique that has been found to be effective for managing back pain is body scan meditation. This involves systematically focusing on different parts of the body and observing any sensations without judgment. By doing so, individuals can learn to identify areas of tension or pain in their body and work to release it through techniques such as deep breathing or relaxation exercises.\n\nAnother mindfulness technique that can be helpful for managing stress and back pain is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) therapy. This program involves mindfulness meditation, yoga, and body awareness training. It has been found to be effective in reducing pain and improving quality of life in individuals with chronic pain conditions.\n\nIn addition to these specific techniques, incorporating mindfulness into daily life can also help reduce stress and manage back pain. This can involve simple practices such as paying attention to the breath while walking, taking breaks to stretch and move throughout the day, and practicing gratitude and kindness towards oneself and others.\n\nOverall, mindfulness can be a powerful tool for managing stress and back pain. By learning to be present in the moment and accepting one's thoughts and feelings, individuals can reduce stress and pain, improve quality of life, and cultivate a greater sense of well-being."}, {"Prompt Length": 297, "Output Length": 10, "prompt": "If you want to convey the product's features visually without telling a story, you can use a combination of different camera angles and techniques to showcase the product in different scenarios, such as:\n\n1.

The acid could also be used to melt through certain obstacles or barriers in the environment, creating new pathways for the player to explore.\n2. Infector: This Amplified has a unique strain of the parasite that can infect other zombies in the area, causing them to mutate and become even more dangerous. The player would need to take out the Infector quickly before it has a chance to spread its infection too far.\n3. Crawler: This Amplified is similar to the Hydra in that it has multiple heads, but instead of being attached to a single body, each head is connected to its own small, spider-like body. These Crawlers can scuttle along walls and ceilings, making it difficult for the player to keep track of them.\n4. Berserker: This Amplified has a greatly enhanced strength and agility, but is also extremely reckless and prone to charging headfirst into danger.

If you set `random_state` to a fixed value, like 42, `train_test_split` will always generate the same random splits for the same input data. This is useful for getting consistent results each time you run your code.\n\nHere's an example code that demonstrates this:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create some input data\nX = np.arange(100).reshape((50, 2))\ny = np.arange(50)\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets with random_state=42\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Print the training and testing sets\nprint(\"Training data:\\n\", X_train, y_train)\nprint(\"Testing data:\\n\", X_test, y_test)\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets again with random_state=42\nX_train2, X_test2, y_train2, y_test2 = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Print the training and testing sets\nprint(\"Training data:\\n\", X_train2, y_train2)\nprint(\"Testing data:\\n\", X_test2, y_test2)\n```\nIn this example code, we generate some input data and use `train_test_split` to split it into training and testing sets with `test_size=0.2` and `random_state=42`. We then print the resulting training and testing sets. We then call `train_test_split` again with the same input data and the same `test_size` and `random_state` parameters, and print the resulting training and testing sets again.\n\nIf you run this code, you will see that the two sets of training and testing data are identical.

Why do you fear the bestial instinct that courses through your veins?\"\n\nBearach stands his ground, but he is trembling with fear. He knows that he is no match for Malar in a fair fight, but he also knows that he cannot let the deity sway him to his cause. In a voice that is stronger than he feels, Bearach says, \"I will not give in to bloodlust and violence. I am a protector of the innocent, and I will not let the wild consume me.\"\n\nMalar laughs, a sound that is both joyful and menacing. \"Brave words, dragonborn,\" he says. \"But you will not be able to resist forever. The call of the hunt is irresistible, and sooner or later, you will give in.\"\n\nWith that, Malar disappears as suddenly as he appeared, leaving Bearach and his companions to ponder his words. Bearach knows that his fear of losing control is not unfounded, and he vows to become stronger and more resolute in his beliefs. He also knows that he may one day face Malar again, and that the outcome of that encounter will determine his fate.\n\nThis encounter with Malar could be the start of a larger conflict between Bearach and the deity, or it could be a one-time event that serves to reinforce Bearach's beliefs and motivations.

To add a new block to the blockchain, miners must solve a complex mathematical problem known as a hash puzzle. This requires significant computational power and energy consumption. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin, as well as transaction fees from the transactions included in the block.\n\nThe incentives provided by the proof-of-work mechanism are designed to encourage miners to contribute their computational power to the network, in order to validate transactions and maintain the security of the blockchain. By providing a financial reward for solving the hash puzzle, miners have an incentive to invest in expensive computing equipment and to compete with each other to be the first to solve the puzzle.\n\nIn addition to the financial rewards, miners also play an important role in securing the network. By validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, miners ensure that the network is decentralized and resistant to attacks. This is because in order to alter the blockchain, an attacker would need to control a majority of the computing power on the network, which is known as a 51% attack. The cost of acquiring such a large amount of computing power would be prohibitively expensive, making the network highly secure.\n\nOverall, the concept of incentives and proof of work in Bitcoin are designed to create a decentralized and secure network that is resistant to attacks and can be trusted to process transactions. By providing financial rewards for miners and encouraging them to compete with each other, the network is able to maintain its integrity and ensure that transactions are validated in a secure and efficient manner."}, {"Prompt Length": 346, "Output Length": 22, "prompt": "Ashira sat next to the small child in the dim light of the cave.

A prototype is typically a rough, simplified version of the final product that is used to demonstrate its functionality and gather feedback from users.\n\nPrototyping can be beneficial in a number of circumstances. For example, it can be used to:\n\n* Test out different design ideas and concepts\n* Gather user feedback and make design improvements\n* Demonstrate the functionality of the product to stakeholders\n* Identify and resolve technical or design issues early in the development process\n\nPrototyping is often used in software development as a way to explore and refine the design of a system before building the final version. However, the construction of a prototype does not always increase the overall cost of software development. In some cases, it may actually save time and resources by identifying and resolving issues early on, rather than waiting until later in the development process.\n\nThe cost of prototyping depends on the complexity and scope of the prototype being developed.

In general, fluctuations in physical systems can be caused by various factors, such as random fluctuations in temperature or the presence of external noise.\n\nTo prove that the rate of change in a physical system does not fluctuate, it is necessary to perform measurements that are precise enough to detect any small fluctuations, and to control or eliminate any external sources of noise that could affect the measurements. For example, in the case of the cesium 133 atom, which is used to define the second, the measurement of the transitions between the hyperfine levels of the ground state must be performed in a highly controlled environment, such as a vacuum chamber, to minimize any effects of external noise.\n\nIn addition to precise measurements, it is also important to have a well-understood theoretical model of the physical system. This allows for a precise prediction of the expected rate of change, and for the identification of any deviations from the expected behavior that could indicate a fluctuation in the rate of change.\n\nIn conclusion, proving that the rate of change in a physical system does not fluctuate requires precise measurements, a well-controlled experimental environment, and a well-understood theoretical model of the system.

Stomach: The stomach is where ethanol is first introduced, and its absorption rate is determined by the ke function, which depends on the initial dose of ethanol.\n2. Central Compartment: This compartment represents the bloodstream and accounts for the distribution and elimination of ethanol and acetaldehyde.\n3.

The primary function of MIS is to collect, process, store, and disseminate information to support decision-making at all levels of an organization. This information helps managers to make informed decisions that can impact the organization's performance.\n\nThe following are the roles of MIS in organizational decision-making:\n\n1. Data Collection and Analysis:\nMIS collects data from various sources such as internal departments, external sources, and industry reports. The data collected is analyzed to provide useful insights to decision-makers. The analysis helps managers to identify trends, patterns, and areas of concern that require attention. For example, MIS can be used to analyze sales data to identify the most popular products and customer preferences, which can be used to make informed marketing decisions.\n2. Decision Support:\nMIS provides decision support to managers by providing relevant and timely information. The information provided includes reports, dashboards, and analytics that help managers to make informed decisions. For example, MIS can provide a report on inventory levels, which can help managers to make purchasing decisions, thus avoiding stockouts or overstocking.\n3. Planning and Forecasting:\nMIS can be used for planning and forecasting activities. It provides managers with historical data and projections that can be used to make future plans. For example, MIS can provide projections on future sales and revenue, which can be used to make decisions on production capacity and staffing requirements.\n4. Communication and Collaboration:\nMIS facilitates communication and collaboration among different departments and stakeholders in an organization. The system provides a platform for sharing information, feedback, and ideas. For example, MIS can be used to collaborate on projects, share files, and track progress.\n5. Monitoring and Control:\nMIS helps managers to monitor and control activities within the organization. It provides alerts and notifications on exceptions and deviations from planned activities. For example, MIS can be used to monitor employee performance, identify areas of improvement, and provide feedback to employees.\n\nIn conclusion, MIS plays a crucial role in organizational decision-making by providing managers with relevant and timely information. It helps managers to make informed decisions that can impact the organization's performance. MIS provides decision support, planning and forecasting, communication and collaboration, monitoring and control, and data collection and analysis, which are essential for effective decision-making.

If the function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to that object. If the function is called as a standalone function, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js) in non-strict mode or `undefined` in strict mode.\n\nIn contrast, arrow functions do not have their own `this` binding. Instead, they inherit the `this` value from the surrounding lexical scope, which is the closest parent function that has its own `this` keyword. In other words, the value of `this` in an arrow function is determined by the context in which it is defined, not how it is called.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate the difference:\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  name: 'Alice',\n  greet: function() {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`); // regular function, this refers to obj\n  },\n  greetArrow: () => {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`); // arrow function, this refers to the global object (window or global)\n  }\n};\n\nobj.greet(); // logs \"Hello, Alice!\"\nobj.greetArrow(); // logs \"Hello, undefined!\"\n```\nIn this example, `obj` has two methods, `greet` and `greetArrow`. `greet` is a regular function that uses `this` to access the `name` property of `obj`. `greetArrow` is an arrow function that also tries to use `this` to access the `name` property of `obj`.

The `id` property is a unique identifier for the permission, and the `type` property is set to `User`, which indicates that this permission is granted to individual users.\n\nWhen you use the `CustomAuthorizationMiddleware` in your ASP.NET MVC Core application, you can check whether a user has the required app role and permission to access a specific page or control.

Now, we can use the t-test to determine if this difference is statistically significant. We can use the `ttest_ind()` function from the `scipy.stats` module to perform the t-test. This function takes two arrays of values and returns the t-statistic and the p-value.\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\nt_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(manual_cars['price'], auto_cars['price'], equal_var=False)\n\nprint('T-statistic:', t_stat)\nprint('P-value:', p_value)\n```\nOutput:\n```makefile\nT-statistic: -9.134290873691375\nP-value: 1.1462753861932673e-19\n```\nThe t-statistic measures the difference between the means of the two groups relative to the variation within the groups. The p-value is the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as the one we calculated if the null hypothesis (that the means are equal) is true. In this case, the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, which is the typical threshold for statistical significance. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean car prices of automatic and manual cars."}, {"Prompt Length": 322, "Output Length": 16, "prompt": "Sure!

When an event occurs on an element inside the parent element, it will bubble up the DOM tree and reach the parent element. The event listener on the parent element can then examine the event object to determine which child element was actually clicked on.\n\nTo implement event delegation in your code, you can attach the event listener to the parent element (in this case, the element that contains all 5 buttons) instead of each button. Then in the event listener function, you can use the event object's `target` property to determine which button was actually clicked on. For example:\n```javascript\nconst parentElement = document.querySelector('.rating-stars');\nparentElement.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n  if (event.target.matches('.rating-stars button')) {\n    // do something with the button that was clicked\n  }\n});\n```\nThis way, you can use the same event listener function for all buttons, regardless of whether they currently exist on the page or not, and you can use the `event.target` property to determine which button was actually clicked on.\n\nRegarding the if statement, you can use event.target.classList.contains(\"star-fill-100\") check if the star is filled or not. Based on this you can decide whether to update the rating with the value or null.\n\nYou can re-attach the event listener after updating the class of the button, but that could be less efficient compared to the event delegation approach."}, {"Prompt Length": 512, "Output Length": 20, "prompt": "Emotional coaching helps children aged 3-5 recognize, understand, and manage their emotions, promoting emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-regulation.

is Changing the Game\n\nCustomer service has always been a vital part of any business, and with the rise of technology, it has undergone significant changes. One of the most notable changes is the use of chatbots, which are automated tools that can assist customers with their queries and problems. However, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are becoming smarter and more sophisticated, offering a personalized and seamless experience to customers. In this blog post, we'll explore how AI-enhanced customer service is changing the game for businesses and customers alike.\n\nWhat are Chatbots with a Brain?\n\nChatbots with a Brain refers to the use of AI-powered chatbots in customer service. These chatbots are equipped with natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms that enable them to understand and respond to customers' queries and concerns in a human-like manner. These chatbots can also learn from previous interactions and improve their responses over time, making them more effective and efficient in handling customer requests.\n\nThe Benefits of AI-Enhanced Customer Service\n\nAI-enhanced customer service has several benefits for both businesses and customers. One of the most significant advantages is the ability to offer personalized and seamless experiences to customers. With the help of AI, chatbots can analyze customer data and provide tailored recommendations and solutions, enhancing the customer experience and driving customer satisfaction.\n\nAnother significant advantage of AI-enhanced customer service is the ability to reduce wait times and handle a high volume of requests simultaneously. Chatbots can handle multiple customer requests simultaneously, ensuring that customers receive timely responses and reducing the need for human intervention.\n\nThe Challenges of AI-Enhanced Customer Service\n\nWhile AI-enhanced customer service has several benefits, there are also some challenges that businesses need to address. One of the main challenges is the potential for chatbots to lack empathy and understanding of complex customer issues. While AI algorithms can learn from previous interactions and improve their responses, they may not be able to handle complex or emotional issues that require human empathy and understanding.\n\nAnother challenge is the potential for data privacy and security issues. Chatbots collect and store customer data, raising concerns about data privacy and security. Businesses need to ensure that they have proper security measures in place to protect customer data and comply with data protection regulations.\n\nThe Future of AI-Enhanced Customer Service\n\nAs businesses continue to invest in AI-enhanced customer service, the role of chatbots with a Brain will only continue to grow. Businesses that are able to successfully leverage AI technology to enhance their customer service capabilities will be well-positioned to gain a competitive edge in the market.\n\nHowever, to succeed in this space, businesses need to be aware of the limitations of chatbots with a Brain and take steps to ensure that they are still able to provide a human touch when needed. Businesses need to invest in training their customer service representatives to work alongside chatbots to provide a seamless and personalized customer experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI-enhanced customer service is transforming the way businesses interact with customers, providing a personalized and seamless experience that enhances customer satisfaction and drives business growth. With the right investment in technology and training, businesses can leverage AI to improve their customer service capabilities and gain a competitive edge in the market. The future of AI-enhanced customer service looks bright, and businesses and customers alike can look forward to an exciting new era of customer service."}, {"Prompt Length": 1434, "Output Length": 14, "prompt": "Marco Guido Palladino\nThis is the MATLAB code I have right now:\n\n% What the programs do:\n%\n% - Find threshold for given productivity\n\nclearvars; close all;\nglobal law \n\n%-----% Macro Commands %--------------------------------------------------%\non = 1;\noff = 0;\n\nSolveCheck = on;\nRootsCheck = on;\n\nkpic = 1;\n\nversion = 1.1;\nrevision = 0;\ndate = 'February 2023';\n\n%-----% Main parameters %-------------------------------------------------%\n\nr\\_annual = 0.05;\nr\\_quarterly = (1+r\\_annual)^(1/4)-1;\nr\\_monthly = (1+r\\_annual)^(1/12)-1;\nr\\_daily = (1+r\\_annual)^(1/360)-1;\nr = r\\_daily;\n\ntime\\_index = 1;\n\n%-----% Productivity %-----------------------------------------------%\n% Define the parameters of the log-normal distribution for productivity\nmu = log(1.57);\nsigma = 0.1;\n\n% Generate a random sample of values from the log-normal distribution\nn = 10000; % number of samples\ny = exp(mu + sigma \\* randn(n,1));\n\n%-----% Distribution of shock arrival rates %-----------------------------\n \n\n%law = 'Lognormal';\n%law = 'Exponential';\nlaw = 'Weibull';\n\nswitch(law)\n case('Lognormal')\n dmu = 0.80;\n dsigma = 3.28;\n case('Exponential')\n dmu = 0.1;\n case('Weibull')\n dscale = 0.02;\n dshape = 1.1;\nend\n\nscale = -99;\neta = -99;\nkappa = -99;\n\n% Unobserved length of production opportunities [0,+oo) (support for G function)\ndeltamin = 1e-8;\ndeltamax = 1e+8;\n\n%-----% Policy parameters %-----------------------------------------------%\n% We normalize the value of unemployment and we assume values for Firing\n% costs (fc) and cost of writing a contract (cc) - TO BE CHANGED\n\nU = 1/r;\nfc = 50;\ncc = 0.0020;\n\n%-----% Main Program %----------------------------------------------------%\n\ndisp(' ');\ndisp('Temporary Employment, Firm Heterogeneity and Regulation');\ndisp(' ');\ntag = sprintf('Date...................: %s', date); disp(tag);\ntag = sprintf('Version................: %2.1f.%1.0f', version, revision); disp(tag);\ndisp(' ');\n%% SECTION 1:\n\n%----% Evalaute: Thresholds %---------------------------------------------%\n\n% Evaluate: cut-off value for potential conversion (lambdas)\n% Initialize a vector to store the solutions for each value of y\nlambdas = zeros(n,1);\n% Use a loop to solve the equality for each value of y\nfor i = 1:n\n% we need fzero function because the equation can not be solved analytically\nlambdas(i) = fzero(@(lambda) eval\\_lambdas(lambda, cc, U, fc, r, y(i)), 1e-4);\nend\n\n% Evaluate: cut-off value for permanent jobs (lambdap)\n% Here we don't need a function as it can be solved analytically\nt2 = cc + fc;\nlambdap= zeros(n,1);\nfor i = 1:n\n t1(i) = y(i) - r\\*U - r\\*cc;\n lambdap(i) = t1(i)/t2;\nend\n\n% Evaluate: cut-off value for temporary jobs (lambdat)\nlambdat= zeros(n,1);\n% Loop over the values in y\nfor i = 1:n\n% Call the csolve function for each value of y\n% The main difference between csolve and fzero is that csolve is used to solve systems \n% of nonlinear equations symbolically and analytically, whereas fzero is used to find \n% the root (zero) of a single nonlinear equation numerically.\nlambdat(i) = csolve(@(lambda) eval\\_lambdat(lambda,cc,U,fc,r,y(i)),1.5,[],1e-8,300);\nend\n\n%----% Durations %-------------------------------------------%\n\n% Preallocate arrays to store results\nDelta0\\_deltat = zeros(n,1);\nDelta0\\_deltap = zeros(n,1);\nDelta0\\_deltas = zeros(n,1);\ndeltat = zeros(n,1);\ndeltap = zeros(n,1);\ndeltas = zeros(n,1);\n\nfor i = 1:n\n% Evaluate duration\ndeltat(i) = 1./lambdat(i);\nDelta0\\_deltat(i) = eval\\_Delta(deltat(i),cc,U,fc,r,y(i));\ndeltap(i) = 1./lambdap(i);\nDelta0\\_deltap(i) = eval\\_Delta(deltap(i),cc,U,fc,r,y(i));\ndeltas(i) = 1./lambdas(i);\nDelta0\\_deltas(i) = eval\\_Delta(deltas(i),cc,U,fc,r,y(i));\nend\n\nresult\\_flows = [y, lambdas, lambdap, lambdat];\n\n%----% Stocks %-------------------------------------------%\n\n% Define the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Weibull distribution\nG = @(lambda, dscale, dshape) 1 - exp(-(lambda./dscale).^dshape);\n\n% Permanent stock\nstockP = zeros(n,1);\njobsP = zeros(n,1);\nfor i = 1:n\n jobsP(i) = G(lambdap(i), dscale, dshape) - G(1e-8, dscale, dshape);\n stockP(i) = integral(@(lambda) (1./lambda) .\\* jobsP(i), 1e-8, lambdap(i));\nend\n\n% Temporary stock\nstockT = zeros(n,1);\njobsT = zeros(n,1);\nfor i = 1:n\n % Approximate the gradient numerically\n jobsT(i) = G(lambdat(i), dscale, dshape) - G(lambdap(i), dscale, dshape);\n stockT(i) = integral(@(lambda) (1./lambda).\\*log(y(i)./(r.\\*U)) .\\* jobsT(i), lambdap(i), lambdat(i));\nend\n\nresult\\_stocks = [y, jobsP, jobsT stockP, stockT];\n\nSuppose that now I want to estimate dshape, dscale, fc and cc using moments from the data.

The model is based on dilated convolutions, which allow the receptive field to grow exponentially with the depth of the network, while keeping the computational cost constant. The model generates high-quality speech and music samples that are nearly indistinguishable from real recordings. WaveNet has been used for a variety of applications, including text-to-speech synthesis, music generation, and voice conversion.\n\nMain Architecture:\nThe main architecture of WaveNet consists of a stack of causal dilated convolutions, which operate on the raw audio waveform in an autoregressive manner. The network takes as input a sequence of raw audio samples and predicts the distribution of the next sample at each time step. The output distribution is then sampled to obtain the next sample, which is fed back into the network as input for the next time step.\n\nThe dilated convolutions in WaveNet have a special structure, where the filter weights are shared across time and across channels, but are multiplied by a different set of coefficients at each time step, determined by a set of learnable gating functions. This allows the network to capture long-range dependencies in the audio signal, while avoiding the computational cost of a fully connected network. The network also uses skip connections to bypass several layers at a time, allowing the output of one block of dilated convolutions to be added to the output of an earlier block, and fed as input to a later block.\n\nMain Code:\nHere's some sample code for a simplified version of the WaveNet architecture using Keras:\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, Multiply, Add, Activation\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n\ndef build_wavenet(input_shape, num_filters=128, num_layers=10, num_dilation_rates=3):\n    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)\n\n    # Initial convolutional layer\n    x = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=2, padding='causal')(inputs)\n\n    # Stack of dilated convolutional layers\n    for i in range(num_layers):\n        for j in range(num_dilation_rates):\n            # Dilated convolutional layer with exponentially increasing dilation rate\n            dilation_rate = 2 ** j\n            x1 = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=2, padding='causal', dilation_rate=dilation_rate)(x)\n\n            # Gating function\n            x2 = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=2, padding='causal', dilation_rate=dilation_rate)(x)\n            x2 = Activation('sigmoid')(x2)\n\n            # Element-wise multiplication and addition\n            x = Multiply()([x1, x2])\n            x = Add()([x, inputs if j == 0 else skip])\n\n            # Skip connection\n            if j == num_dilation_rates - 1:\n                skip = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=1)(x)\n                inputs = skip if i == 0 else Add()([inputs, skip])\n\n    # Final convolutional and output layers\n    x = Activation('relu')(inputs)\n    x = Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size=1)(x)\n    x = Activation('relu')(x)\n    x = Conv1D(1, kernel_size=1)(x)\n\n    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x, name='WaveNet')\n    return model\n```\nThis code builds a WaveNet model that takes as input a sequence of raw audio samples, represented as a 1D array, and outputs a probability distribution over the next sample.

It is a modification of the traditional ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test that accounts for the possibility of cointegration between the two series.\n\nTo check for cointegration using the CADF test, we first need to test each time series for stationarity using the ADF test. If one or both series are non-stationary, we can take their first differences to make them stationary. We then regress one time series on the other using ordinary least squares (OLS) and obtain the residuals.\n\nWe then perform the CADF test on the residuals to determine if they are stationary and hence whether the two series are cointegrated. The null hypothesis of the CADF test is that the residuals contain a unit root, which indicates that the two series are not cointegrated.

Here are some different ways to achieve encapsulation in JavaScript:\n\n1. Using Constructor Functions: Constructor functions are functions that create and initialize objects. By defining variables within a constructor function using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords, those variables become private to that function, and cannot be accessed or modified from outside the function.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nfunction BankAccount(balance) {\n  var _balance = balance;\n\n  this.deposit = function(amount) {\n    _balance += amount;\n  };\n\n  this.withdraw = function(amount) {\n    if (amount <= _balance) {\n      _balance -= amount;\n      return true;\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n  };\n\n  this.getBalance = function() {\n    return _balance;\n  };\n}\n\nvar myAccount = new BankAccount(1000);\nmyAccount.deposit(500);\nmyAccount.withdraw(200);\nconsole.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // output: 1300\n```\nIn this example, the `BankAccount` constructor function encapsulates the balance data and the `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` functions that operate on that data.\n\n1. Using Classes: Classes in JavaScript are a newer syntax for defining objects with constructors and methods. Like constructor functions, variables defined within a class using the `let` or `const` keywords are private to that class and cannot be accessed or modified from outside the class.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nclass BankAccount {\n  constructor(balance) {\n    let _balance = balance;\n\n    this.deposit = function(amount) {\n      _balance += amount;\n    };\n\n    this.withdraw = function(amount) {\n      if (amount <= _balance) {\n        _balance -= amount;\n        return true;\n      } else {\n        return false;\n      }\n    };\n\n    this.getBalance = function() {\n      return _balance;\n    };\n  }\n}\n\nlet myAccount = new BankAccount(1000);\nmyAccount.deposit(500);\nmyAccount.withdraw(200);\nconsole.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // output: 1300\n```\nIn this example, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the balance data and the `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` methods that operate on that data.\n\n1. Using Closures: Closures are functions that have access to variables in their outer (enclosing) function scope. By defining a function that returns an object with methods that access variables in the enclosing function, those variables become private to that function and cannot be accessed or modified from outside the function.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nfunction bankAccount(balance) {\n  let _balance = balance;\n\n  function deposit(amount) {\n    _balance += amount;\n  }\n\n  function withdraw(amount) {\n    if (amount <= _balance) {\n      _balance -= amount;\n      return true;\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  function getBalance() {\n    return _balance;\n  }\n\n  return {\n    deposit: deposit,\n    withdraw: withdraw,\n    getBalance: getBalance\n  };\n}\n\nlet myAccount = bankAccount(1000);\nmyAccount.deposit(500);\nmyAccount.withdraw(200);\nconsole.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // output: 1300\n```\nIn this example, the `bankAccount` function encapsulates the balance data and the `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` functions that operate on that data.

ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models are a popular choice for time series forecasting, and they are especially useful when there is evidence of seasonality in the data.\n\nTo start with, let's plot the data to visualize the trend and seasonality, and to identify any outliers or other anomalies.\n```bash\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create a data frame with the median sale price data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  date = as.Date(c(\"2021-09-01\", \"2021-10-01\", \"2021-11-01\", \"2021-12-01\", \"2022-01-01\", \"2022-02-01\", \"2022-03-01\", \"2022-04-01\", \"2022-05-01\", \"2022-06-01\", \"2022-07-01\", \"2022-08-01\", \"2022-09-01\", \"2022-10-01\", \"2022-11-01\", \"2022-12-01\")),\n  median_price = c(503.15, 519, 528.9, 541.62, 561, 569.075, 584.52, 595.21, 602.55, 615.9, 629, 649, 654.05, 672.5, 675, 675)\n)\n\n# Plot the median sale price data\nggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = median_price)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ggtitle(\"Median Sale Price of Burpengary Property (Sep 2021 - Dec 2022)\") +\n  xlab(\"Date\") +\n  ylab(\"Median Sale Price (Thousands of Dollars)\")\n```\nBased on the plot, there seems to be an upward trend in the median sale price, with some seasonality evident in the data as well. There are no major outliers or anomalies that we need to worry about.\n\nNow, we can fit an ARIMA model to the data using the `forecast` package in R. To determine the optimal values of the ARIMA parameters (p, d, and q), we can use the `auto.arima()` function, which automatically selects the best model based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).\n```bash\nlibrary(forecast)\n\n# Fit an ARIMA model to the median sale price data\narima_model <- auto.arima(df$median_price)\n\n# Print the summary of the ARIMA model\nsummary(arima_model)\n```\nThe `auto.arima()` function has chosen an ARIMA(2,1,2) model, which means that the model includes two autoregressive terms, one differencing term, and two moving average terms.\n\nWe can now use the `forecast()` function to generate forecasts for the next few periods. For example, to generate forecasts for the next 12 months, we can use the following code:\n```python\n# Generate forecasts for the next 12 months\nforecast_values <- forecast(arima_model, h = 12)\n\n# Print the forecast values\nprint(forecast_values)\n```\nThe `forecast()` function generates forecasts for the next 12 months, along with prediction intervals for each forecast. The forecast values and prediction intervals are stored in the `forecast_values` object, which we can print to the console to see the results.\n\nI hope this helps you with your analysis of the median sale price data for Burpengary!"}, {"Prompt Length": 807, "Output Length": 24, "prompt": "3.1. Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Retrosynthetic Analysis\n\nIn recent years, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as powerful tools to address the limitations of manual retrosynthetic analysis and traditional computational methods. These data-driven approaches can learn complex patterns and relationships from large chemical datasets, enabling more accurate and efficient predictions of retrosynthetic routes (86, 87). This section discusses the application of ML and DL in retrosynthetic analysis, highlighting key advancements and methodologies.\n\n1. Neural network models: Neural networks, particularly deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been applied to predict retrosynthetic routes by learning complex representations of molecular structures and reaction patterns (88, 89). For example, the work by Segler et al. (90) employed a combination of CNNs and RNNs to predict suitable precursors for a given target molecule.\n2. Sequence-to-sequence models: Sequence-to-sequence models, which are typically based on RNNs and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have been applied to translate molecular representations of target compounds into precursor molecules, mimicking the process of retrosynthetic disconnection (91, 92). The work by Liu et al. (93) used a sequence-to-sequence model to predict high-level disconnection patterns for a given target molecule.\n3. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs): GCNs have been used to model molecular graphs for predicting retrosynthetic routes, taking advantage of their ability to capture local and global structural features of molecules (94, 95). For instance, Coley et al. (96) developed a graph-convolutional approach to predict retrosynthetic routes by learning a continuous representation of molecular structures and reaction templates.\n4. Reinforcement learning (RL): RL techniques, such as Q-learning and deep Q-networks (DQNs), have been applied to retrosynthetic analysis by modeling the disconnection process as a decision-making problem, where the algorithm iteratively learns the optimal actions to perform at each step (97, 98). The work by Zhou et al. (99) employed a DQN-based approach to navigate the retrosynthetic tree and identify efficient synthetic routes.\n5. Transfer learning: Transfer learning techniques have been used to leverage pre-trained models and knowledge from related tasks to improve the performance of retrosynthetic analysis models, particularly when training data is limited (100, 101). The work by Schwaller et al. (102) demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning in predicting reaction templates for retrosynthetic disconnections.\n6. Multi-task learning: Multi-task learning methods, which involve training a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, have been used to improve the accuracy and generalizability of retrosynthetic analysis models by leveraging the shared knowledge between related tasks (103, 104). An example of this approach can be found in the work by Dai et al. (105), where a single model was trained to predict multiple reaction outcomes, such as yield and selectivity, in addition to retrosynthetic routes.\n\nThe application of ML and DL in retrosynthetic analysis has shown significant promise in overcoming the limitations of manual methods and traditional computational approaches, enabling the development of more accurate, efficient, and scalable tools for synthetic route prediction (106, 107).\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

You can then use these identifiers in your external authorization system, such as Azure AD, to define the access policies for each resource.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define a resource in Azure AD:\n\n1. Define a resource: Define a resource in Azure AD that corresponds to a page or control in your ASP.NET MVC Core application. You can define the resource by adding a new application manifest file in the Azure Portal, and adding a new `resources` property to the manifest. The `resources` property is an array of objects that define each resource.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define a resource in the `resources` property:\n```json\n\"resources\": [\n  {\n    \"resourceAppId\": \"your-application-client-id\",\n    \"resourceAccess\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"e7d262d2-17df-4268-8c08-7d21b9eac2b1\",\n        \"type\": \"Scope\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"resourceDisplayName\": \"Page1\",\n    \"resourceName\": \"your-application-uri/page1\"\n  }\n],\n```\nIn this example, the `resources` property contains one object that defines the \"Page1\" resource. The `resourceAppId` property is the client ID of your ASP.NET MVC Core application in Azure AD, and the `resourceName` property is the URI of the protected resource.\n\n2. Assign permissions: Assign permissions to each resource in Azure AD. You can assign permissions by adding them to the `resourceAccess` property of the resource object. The `resourceAccess` property is an array of objects that define the permissions for the resource.\n\nHere's an example of how you can assign permissions to the \"Page1\" resource in the `resourceAccess` property:\n```json\n\"resourceAccess\": [\n  {\n    \"id\": \"e7d262d2-17df-4268-8c08-7d21b9eac2b1\",\n    \"type\": \"Scope\"\n  }\n],\n```\nIn this example, the `id` property is the unique identifier for the permission, and the `type` property is set to `Scope`, which indicates that this is a permission scope.\n\n3. Define policies: Define policies that determine who has access to each resource and under what conditions. You can define policies using a policy language, such as XACML or JSON-based policies, in Azure AD or an external authorization system.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define a policy in Azure AD:\n```json\n{\n  \"if\": {\n    \"allOf\": [\n      {\n        \"matches\": {\n          \"request.resource.name\": \"your-application-uri/page1\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"matches\": {\n          \"request.user.groups\": \"Page1_Readers\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"then\": {\n    \"permit\": {}\n  },\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n```\nIn this example, the policy grants access to the \"Page1\" resource if the user is a member of the \"Page1\\_Readers\" group.\n\n4. Implement policies: Once you have defined your policies, you can implement them in your ASP.NET MVC Core application using a custom authorization middleware. The middleware can intercept requests to protected resources and evaluate the user's attributes and other factors against the policies defined in the external authorization system.\n\nBy defining each page and control as a resource and assigning it a unique identifier, you can achieve fine-grained access control in your ASP.NET MVC Core application"}, {"Prompt Length": 786, "Output Length": 20, "prompt": "I apologize for the mistake.

We create a new vector layer and add your polygons to its source, and add an event listener for the `click` event on the layer.\n\nInside the event listener function, we first reset the style of the previously selected feature (if there was one) by calling `setStyle(null)` on it. We then set the style and number for the newly selected feature. We set the style using the `getStyle()` method of the vector layer, which returns the `style` option defined on the layer. We set the `selectedFeature` variable to the newly selected feature and increment the `nextNumber` variable.\n\nWe update the style of the features based on their `selectedFeature` property by using an `ol.style.Style` object.

We store the resulting tokenized text in a list called `texts`.\n\nNext, we create a dictionary and corpus for the topic model using the `Dictionary()` and `corpora` modules from `gensim`. The `Dictionary()` method creates a mapping of words to numeric IDs, and the `doc2bow()` method converts the tokenized text to bag-of-words format.\n\nWe then train the topic model using the `LdaMulticore()` method from `gensim`, which uses a form of unsupervised learning to identify patterns in the text data and group similar articles into topics.

We are talking about your butt and especially your glutes, the big muscles that constitute most of your butt. The difficulty is that, in modern times, we have mostly used our glutes to sit on. They have atrophied as a result. The use of the buttocks exclusively as a seat cushion is a recent development in evolutionary terms, and a rotten one. It is handy, lord knows, but that wasn\u2019t the original design idea, and we are paying a horrendous price for it, mostly in back pain. \nLetting your glutes go to hell in idleness (\u201cgluteal amnesia,\u201d as the great student of back pain Dr. Stuart McGill called it) is an absolutely dreadful idea. By all means, continue to sit on them. But do much, much more, too. Remember that the glutes are the biggest muscles in your body, they have serious loads to bear, and it is critical that we let them do it. Because, if we don\u2019t, our spines (and the tiny muscles around them) will carry those loads, and they are not designed for it. They protest . . . they hurt. And they will continue to hurt until you wake up your glutes and let them do their job. \nThe gluteal muscles are a group of three muscles that make up the buttocks. There are several smaller muscles back there as well, including the piriformis. They look like this (see diagram below). \nIn a healthy person, the gluteal muscles perform a bunch of important functions. Here\u2019s what they should be doing: \n\u2022 helping you to stand up and maintain erect posture \n\u2022 keeping you from falling forward when you walk or run \n\u2022 keeping your pelvis from collapsing when you are standing on one leg or walking when only one foot is in contact with the ground \n\u2022 helping you to rise from a seated position \n\u2022 helping you pick things up \n\u2022 helping you climb stairs, ski, run, row\u2014and that old favorite, make love\nGluteal Muscles\n\nAll kinds of things. Obviously, these are some of the most important things you do and these are some of the most important muscles in your body. \nWhen you let your glutes go to sleep, things get bad. They \u201cforget\u201d all those critical functions, and the muscles that take up the slack are not up to the job. As we compress the muscles (by sitting on them), nerves and blood vessels in the gluteal muscle don\u2019t work as well. Our brain literally loses its connectivity with them. The muscles, and the neural pathways, atrophy (or \u201close preference\u201d); the brain \u201cforgets\u201d them. Hence, the term gluteal amnesia. In my experience, there is a very high correlation between the glutes going to sleep and back pain. Very high.\nHere\u2019s why: When those big powerful muscles aren\u2019t doing their job, the spine takes over. It bears the brunt of the forces that the glutes are supposed to be handling and it gets overwhelmed and damaged. Instead of using those big muscles to do things like pick up your child or grandchild, you first use the tiny muscles around your spine to do them, and those muscles can\u2019t handle it. They become strained (which causes pain, all by itself) and eventually fail. Then things get quite a bit worse. When those little muscles fail, the forces that your glutes were supposed to be handling get transmitted directly onto your discs, joints, ligaments, and tendons. That is not what they are supposed to do and it causes serious problems. Conversely, those big psoas muscles get reflexively tighter, putting more pressure on the spine. Think about it: Every time you get out of a chair, pick something up, tie your shoe, or climb the stairs, you are putting a ton of pressure on your spine that it is not designed to bear. You can do it for a while. You can do almost anything for a while. But over the days, months, and years, these micro irritations add up to macro damage. Remember Chris\u2019s explanation of \u201cgeologic time\u201d? Mountains are ground down to rubble in geologic time. Your spine is ground down to rubble in your own version of geologic time, if your glutes don\u2019t do their job.\nSummary: Letting your glutes go to sleep is a terrible idea. Reversing that process and waking them up is crucial to healing back pain. Once those muscles wake up and start doing their intended work, the muscles that do the opposite motion on the joint, the psoas muscles, reflexively loosen up. If you didn\u2019t know this, don\u2019t feel bad. A lot of therapists and doctors don\u2019t know it, either. Or don\u2019t treat it effectively. Teaching you how to treat the problem effectively is one of the most important things we do in this book. \nHere\u2019s what you need to do, in three steps: Wake up your glutes, make them strong, and learn to use them at the appropriate times, as they were designed to be used. \nPART ONE: WAKING UP THE SLEEPING GIANTS\nYou tried using your glutes with the bridge exercise. Now let\u2019s try a different way to wake them up. If you had trouble with the bridge, don\u2019t worry. We will come back to that shortly. \nClamshell\nNow, on to the all-important \u201cclamshell\u201d exercise. It is critical\u2014boring and often poorly performed, but it wakes up and strengthens your glutes.\nStep 1: Lie on your side with your hips and knees bent as shown.\nStep 2: Take the thumb of your top hand and dig it inside your upper hip bone, as in the drawing. \nStep 3: Lay the four fingers of that hand across the outside of your hip, as in the picture. \nStep 4: For most of you, your middle finger (or first or third) will be lying right on the gluteal muscles we are trying to wake up. Poke your fingers in there and feel them. Reestablish that connection with your brain. Keep your fingers there.\n\nStep 5: Find your neutral spine and brace your core."}, {"Prompt Length": 893, "Output Length": 17, "prompt": "Sure!

If the registration information is deemed suspicious by the fraud detection system, the system flags the registration for manual review by a human fraud analyst.\n19. The human fraud analyst reviews the registration information and makes a determination as to its validity. If the registration is deemed invalid or fraudulent, the registration process is terminated. If the registration is deemed valid, the system continues to the next step.\n20. If the registration information is deemed valid, system displays a confirmation message to the user, notifying them that their digital identity has been created.\n\nNote: AI-powered identification document reading can significantly speed up the registration process and improve accuracy. However, human oversight is necessary to catch errors and ensure that fraudulent activity is detected. The specific machine learning models and OCR techniques used will depend on the type of identification documents being processed and the requirements of the particular system.

It wakes up the gluteal muscles (the big muscles in your buttocks). It reinforces spinal stabilization. It builds endurance and strength in the muscles on the front and back of the core. And it is the precursor to doing a proper squat, which comes later in the book. \nDo the bridge as follows:\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Bend your knees and put your feet in a flexed position so that your heels are on the ground and the balls of your feet and toes are off of the ground as pictured.\nStep 4: Squeeze your buttocks together as if you were trying to pinch a coin between them.\n\nStep 5: Here\u2019s the tricky part: Using the glutes, lift your hips/torso off of the ground without moving your lower back. You should not articulate the spine and roll up \u201cone vertebra at a time.\u201d You want to do the opposite of that. You want to lift the torso in one solid piece while maintaining your neutral spine. No movement should take place in the lower back.\nStep 6: Hold for five to ten seconds (remember these are suggestions. Hold to your tolerance in the beginning, with ten seconds being your goal). You should feel the muscles in both sides of your buttocks working relatively equally.\nStep 7: Lower your back down to the starting position without losing your neutral spine. Again, do not articulate the spine on the way down. In other words, do not roll the spine down onto the floor one vertebra at a time.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 2 through 7, and do five to ten reps, with ten being your long-term goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Hamstring cramping. If your hamstrings cramp (the muscles that run down the underside of your thighs), gently push your feet into the floor away from you before you lift your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Knee pain. If one or both of your knees hurt, lightly press your knees outward before lifting your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Unable to maintain neutral spine. Start by trying to lift your hips/torso only an inch off the ground. Slowly progress to a full bridge over the next few weeks.\n\u2022 Unable to feel glutes working. Go to Chapter 13. Then come back and start with the following regression.\n\u2022 If your back hurts with this exercise, proceed to the Buttock Squeezes regression on the next page. Try these for a few days or weeks and then come back and try the bridge again, making sure to follow instructions meticulously. If your back still hurts, you may have a spinal condition like severe stenosis that makes you sensitive to extension in the spine. If this is the case, this exercise might not be for you.\nCommon Mistakes\nThe most common mistake for back patients with the bridge exercise is that they use their hamstrings instead of their glutes to bring the hips up into position. If your hamstrings are cramping, then you aren\u2019t using your glutes enough. Go to Chapter 13 and practice \u201cwaking up your glutes,\u201d and then come back to this exercise and try it again.\nREGRESSION\nButtock Squeezes\nIf you don\u2019t have the strength or control yet to perform a single bridge exercise properly for any amount of time, start with buttock squeezes.\n1. Lie on your back, with arms at your side, knees bent, feet hip-width apart.\n2. Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your buttocks together as if trying to squeeze a coin between them.\n4. Hold for ten seconds.\n5. Do ten reps.\nPROGRESSION\nOne-Leg Bridge\nOnce you have mastered the bridge and are able to do it with relative ease and with no discomfort in the back, you may want to progress to the one-leg bridge. You do not have to progress to this exercise. Depending on your spinal condition and your fitness level, you may not need to progress this far. This progression is for those who are reasonably fit and plan to be very active in sports, exercise, or outdoor activities.\n1. Follow all rules for the bridge.\n2. Once your hips and torso are off the ground, give extra care to make sure your core is braced as firmly as possible.\n\n3. Slowly extend one leg at the knee without letting the hips/torso drop on that side. You will feel the glutes of the other stabilizing leg kick in as you extend the leg.\n4. Hold five to ten seconds.\n5. Slowly bring the extended leg back to the bent-knee starting position. (Do not lower your hips/torso while doing this. Maintain the bridge position with a neutral spine until your foot is back on the floor.)\n6. Slowly lower your hips/torso back to the starting position on the floor without articulating the spine.\n7. On the other side, repeat Steps 1 through 6, making sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your core in place before extending the leg at the knee.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 When you go to one leg, it is easy to \u201ccock\u201d your hips to one side, to make it easier. Don\u2019t do that. Keep your thighs parallel during the whole exercise. If you can\u2019t, you aren\u2019t strong enough yet for this exercise.\n\u2022 Regarding extending the leg as you come up/bending the leg down as you go down: Make sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your spine before you try to extend the leg. Conversely, make sure you bring the leg all the way back in before coming down to the starting position.\n\u2022 Do not bring the thigh of the extended leg up. Make sure your thighs remain parallel so that you have to use the gluteal muscles to keep the pelvis stable.\nEXERCISE 3\nCrunch and Plank\nWe discuss these two exercises together because they both do a lot of the same things, and some of you will not get to the plank and that\u2019s okay. The plank will take you a bit further toward returning to strenuous activities, but the crunch is enough to get you out of pain. The purpose of the crunch and the plank is to build endurance and strength in the abdominal wall (crunch and plank) and glutes and lats (plank) and to increase spinal stability. Very few back pain sufferers are strong enough to do a plank properly in the beginning and must do crunches for a while before attempting the plank.\nCrunch\nFirst of all, this exercise is not a sit-up. Sit-ups (the traditional \u201cArmy sit-up,\u201d where you pull yourself into a full sitting position) have been proven to be very risky to the spine. They run dangerous loads through the lumbar discs. If you wanted to develop a way to herniate a disc in a lab, a sit-up would be a good candidate for it. Crunches, unlike full sit-ups, do not allow movement in the lumbar spine. Your lumbar spine stays in neutral throughout.\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Place your hands behind your head, if possible. If you can\u2019t, because of shoulder discomfort, that\u2019s okay. Find a comfortable position for your hands.\nStep 4: Gently draw your chin in toward your neck, giving yourself a \u201cdouble chin.\u201d Hold this position throughout the exercise.\nStep 5: Slowly and carefully raise your shoulder blades and head toward the ceiling an inch or two, giving a moderate squeeze in the abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your lower back. Keep a neutral spine; this will be harder than you think. Only bring your shoulders off the floor as far as you can without moving your lower back. The max distance, when you\u2019re great at it, would be no more than, say, four inches.\n\nStep 6: Hold five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nStep 7: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your lower back.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 1 through 7, for five to ten reps, with ten being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u201cMy neck hurts.\u201d First, you shouldn\u2019t be pulling your head with your arms. Your arms/hands are there only to provide a little support to your head and neck. Make sure that you pull your chin in toward your neck before initiating the exercise. This will engage your deep neck flexors that support the spine. If this does not relieve neck pain, move to the Regression.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 The most common mistake is flattening or (worse) rounding the back. It is crucial that you not make this mistake. Doing crunches while continually rounding or flattening the back will promote spinal instability, the opposite of our goal. Details matter!\n\u2022 Chin jutting. If your chin is poking out toward the ceiling with each rep, you are not stabilizing your cervical spine and your neck extensors are taking over. Make sure to draw the chin in toward your neck before each rep.\nREGRESSION\nAbdominal Contractions\nDo this exercise until you build up enough abdominal strength to accomplish the crunch.\n1. Start in the same position as for the bridge.\n2. Place one hand behind your lower back and one hand inside your front hipbone beside your navel.\n3. Squeeze your abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your back. You should feel your back being still with one hand and the abs engaging with the other hand.\n4. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n5. Repeat for several reps until fatigue sets in.\nPROGRESSION\nPlank\nOnce you have mastered the crunch and are able to do crunches with relative ease and without pain or movement in the lower back, try the plank. This is a great exercise to build increased core stability, endurance, and strength. Some of you (especially those with severe stenosis) may never be able to do a plank. That\u2019s okay. Give the plank a try, and if it doesn\u2019t work for you, stay with crunches. If you do go on to the plank, follow the directions closely; most people do this exercise incorrectly.\n\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent and palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders.\n5. Lift your knees off of the floor so you are now on your toes and forearms.\n6. \u201cTraction\u201d your forearms into the floor. In other words, press them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and down toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n\n7. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n8. Slowly put your knees back down first. Do not let your hips/pelvis go to the floor first; this would put your back into extension and may cause pain.\n9. Repeat Steps 1 through 8, for two to five reps, with five being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my lower back.\u201d Some people just can\u2019t do a plank. Even if they do it the right way, it still aggravates their back. If you can\u2019t do a plank, drop it and stick with crunches. But first, be sure that you can\u2019t do it. For example, if your lower back is hurting, try sticking your buttocks in the air a little more. It could be that your hips are sagging toward the floor, putting your back into extension. Also, make sure the core is fully engaged before moving from knees to toes. Lastly, make sure you are squeezing your buttocks, which will support the lower back. If none of that works, forget it; stick with crunches.\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my shoulders.\u201d Make sure you are tractioning your forearms down into the floor and back toward your toes. This engages the supportive muscles of the rotator cuff. If this doesn\u2019t help, try the regression that follows.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 Feet and legs are not together, which makes gluteal engagement more difficult.\n\u2022 Back is up but the hips are dropping toward the floor. This will cause back pain in people with conditions such as stenosis or facet syndrome.\n\u2022 You\u2019re forgetting to pull shoulders back and forearms into the floor with chin jutting. This will cause an increase in pressure in the shoulders and/or neck, resulting in shoulder and neck pain.\nREGRESSION\nPlank on Knees\nIf you aren\u2019t quite ready for plank but think crunch is just too easy, try this one.\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent, palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders (see illustration, for the plank).\n5. Traction your forearms into the floor, pulling them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and back toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n6. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nEXERCISE 4\nDynamic Hamstring Stretch\nCAUTION\nThis exercise may irritate symptoms of people with active radiculopathy, such as severe leg/foot pain, and numbness or tingling in the legs or feet. If you have these symptoms, start with caution; you may not be able to do this exercise. If this exercise exacerbates your leg or back symptoms, skip it for now and come back to it when the symptoms are resolved.\nThe dynamic hamstring stretch helps to improve mobility in the hips and also helps to reinforce and strengthen your ability to maintain a neutral spine while moving the legs. It also builds endurance and strength in the core.\nStep 1: Lie on your back and find neutral spine.\nStep 2: Brace the core to lock in neutral spine.\n\nStep 3: Bend one leg at the knee with your foot flat on floor. Straighten out the other leg onto the floor, with foot flexed (toes pointed up).\nStep 4: Carefully raise the straight leg without losing your neutral spine; in other words, make sure your lower back isn\u2019t flattening into the floor as your leg comes up. To check, put one of your hands underneath your lower back and feel for movement. Raise the leg only as high as you can without flattening your back into the floor. \nStep 5: Do ten to twenty repetitions on each leg. Do as many as needed to feel that you have mildly stretched your hamstrings and worked your core.\nCommon Mistake\nFlattening the back into the floor as you bring the leg up. Remember, one of the most important points of these exercises is to teach you neutral spine/spinal stability. You do not want to accomplish an increase of movement speed at the expense of spinal stabilization. Bring up your leg only as high as you can without flattening your back or bending your knee. Increasing hamstring flexibility will come with time.\nEXERCISE 5\nSide Plank\nThe side plank works the muscles on the lateral (side) parts of the core, such as the obliques, gluteus medius, and quadratus lumborum. This exercise is a very important one. I mention this because almost everyone hates doing it. But don\u2019t give up: Your back depends on it. Many readers will not be able to do this exercise at first because their core is weak. Don\u2019t worry. There are regressions (easier exercises) for those of you who can\u2019t do this one yet.\nStep 1: Start by lying on your side, propped up on your forearm, with your elbow under your shoulder. Relax the other arm for now. Pull your lower arm shoulder blade inward toward your spine and downward toward your buttocks, engaging the lat muscles.\nStep 2: Drop your hips back a bit so that they sit behind your feet and shoulders."}, {"Prompt Length": 3088, "Output Length": 38, "prompt": "I will paste the whole story. I will split to a few parts.\n\nPROLOGUE\nFilon stood at the front of the lecture hall, his eyes scanning the sea of faces in front of him. He was a lecturer at the University of Lisbon, with a doctorate in philosophy and a passion for imparting knowledge to his students. Today's lecture was on errors in reasoning, and Filon was confident in his ability to engage and educate his audience.\n\"Good morning, everyone,\" Filon began, his voice calm and steady. \"Today, we will be discussing common pitfalls in logical thinking and how to avoid them. Are there any questions before we begin?\"\nFilon fielded a few questions from his students before launching into his lecture, his voice carrying clearly through the room as he outlined the various types of logical fallacies and their consequences. The students listened attentively, taking notes and asking questions as Filon went through the material.\nAfter the lecture, Filon headed to the depot to begin his shift as a tram driver. He loved driving trams, and the steady routine of his job brought him a sense of peace and purpose. Filon spent the next few hours driving the tram through the city, chatting with his passengers and enjoying the sights and sounds of Lisbon.\nAs the end of his shift approached, Filon was looking forward to going home and relaxing for the evening. He had just a few stops left to make before he reached the end of the route. But as he was rounding a corner, disaster struck. A truck lost control and crashed into the side of the tram, causing it to derail and tumble off the tracks. Filon felt a sharp pain in his chest as he was thrown from his seat, and then everything went black.\nWhen Filon awoke, he found himself in a strange, otherworldly place. He was surrounded by a hazy fog, and a sense of unease settled over him as he tried to make sense of his surroundings.\nAs Filon began to regain consciousness, he became aware of a presence nearby. He opened his eyes and saw a woman standing in front of him, watching him with a grave expression on her face. She seemed almost otherworldly, and Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of awe in her presence. \"Who are you?\" Filon asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\"Greetings,\" said the woman, bowing slightly. \"I am Hu Tao, the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.\"\n\"Where am I?\" Filon asked as Hu Tao approached, a sense of unease growing within him. Hu Tao had a fair complexion and a petite build, with bright scarlet eyes and long dark brown hair fading to crimson at the tips. She wore traditional red clothing with a mandarin collar and black porkpie hat adorned with a plum blossom branch. At first glance, Hu Tao appeared to be a quirky and cheerful girl, but Filon had a feeling that she was more complex than she let on.\n\"This is the border,\" Hu Tao replied gravely. \"It is where the souls of the dead come after they leave their bodies behind. It is the place where you will stay for all eternity.\"\nFilon's mind reeled as he tried to make sense of what Hu Tao was saying. Could it be that he was dead? The idea was hard to accept, but the evidence seemed to be mounting against him.\n\"What happens now?\" Filon asked, struggling to keep his voice steady.\n\"That is up to you,\" Hu Tao replied. \"Some choose to accept their fate and move on to the next life, while others choose to linger in this place, unable or unwilling to let go.\"\nFilon thought about this for a moment, and then reached into his pocket and pulled out a note he had found there. It was written in a strange, otherworldly script that he couldn't decipher, but the words \"chosen one\" and \"superpowers\" jumped out at him.\nCould it be that this was why he had been brought to this place? Filon couldn't be sure.\nFilon decided that he wanted to find out more about these powers and what they might be able to do for him. He resolved to reclaim his body and return to the living world, no matter what obstacles might stand in his way.\nBut first, he needed to find a way out of this strange, misty realm. He turned to Hu Tao, hoping that she might be able to help.\n\"Can you tell me how to leave this place?\" Filon asked, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice.\nHu Tao shook her head, a grave expression on her face. \"I'm afraid that is not possible. The dead are meant to stay here for all eternity. It is the natural order of things.\"\nFilon knew that Hu Tao would not be happy about his desire to leave the border, and he sensed that she would do everything in her power to stop him. He resolved to keep his plans a secret for the time being, at least until he had a better understanding of his powers and how they might be able to help him.\n\"I see,\" Filon said calmly, hiding his disappointment. \"Well, I suppose I will have to make the most of my time here then. Do you have any suggestions for how I might pass the time?\"\nHu Tao seemed to sense that Filon was hiding something, and her eyes narrowed slightly as she studied him. But she didn't press the issue, and instead offered a few suggestions for how Filon could occupy himself in the border.\n\"You could try exploring the realm,\" Hu Tao said. \"There are many interesting sights to see and mysteries to uncover. Or you could try communicating with the other souls here, and see what they have to say.\"\nFilon nodded, pretending to be interested in Hu Tao's suggestions even though his mind was already made up. He knew that he had to find a way out of this place, no matter what it took. And he was determined to use his powers to make it happen.\n \nCHAPTER ONE\nThe Chosen One\u2019s Escape\nFilon had spent countless hours in contemplation, trying to find a way to escape the border and reclaim his physical form. He knew that Hu Tao, the 77th Director of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, would do everything in her power to keep him trapped within the border forever. But Filon was determined to break free, and he knew that with his vast knowledge of science and technology, as well as his newly acquired supernatural abilities, he would find a way out.\n\nAs he delved deep into his thoughts, an idea began to form in his mind. He knew that the key to his escape lay in harnessing the power of electricity, the life force that flowed through all living beings. And so he set to work, using his powers to gather all the necessary materials and tools. He toiled day and night, his hands a blur of motion as he assembled generators, transformers, and miles of high voltage wires.\n\nFinally, after weeks of intense labor, Filon's creation was complete. He stood in front of the massive machine, his hands trembling with excitement as he prepared to flip the switch. And with a deafening roar, the machine came to life, its powerful energy coursing through Filon's body and imbuing him with the strength and vitality he needed to break free from the border.\n\nWith a fierce determination, Filon set off, his powerful aura melting away the barriers and puzzles that Hu Tao had put in place to keep the dead trapped within the border. He moved with lightning speed, his senses heightened and his reflexes sharpened by the energy coursing through his veins.\n\nAs he approached the exit, Filon knew that Hu Tao would be waiting for him. He braced himself for the inevitable confrontation, his mind racing as he prepared for the fight to come. And then, as he stepped through the threshold and into the mortal world, he saw her standing there, her grave expression and flowing white robes a stark contrast to the vibrant energy pulsing within him.\n\n\"You should not have come here, Filon,\" Hu Tao said, her voice cold and menacing. \"The dead are meant to stay within the border, and you are no exception.\"\n\n\"I will not be trapped here any longer,\" Filon replied, his voice laced with determination. \"I have reclaimed my physical form and I will not be held captive by the likes of you.\"\n\nAs Filon and Hu Tao continued to argue, Hu Tao became increasingly agitated. Despite Filon's calm and measured approach, Hu Tao was unwilling to listen to his reasons for wanting to leave the border.\n\n\"You think you can just waltz out of here and live your life like nothing ever happened?\" Hu Tao snarled. \"You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. The living world is a dangerous place, full of suffering and pain. You're better off staying here where you're safe.\"\n\nFilon shook his head. \"I can't just sit here and do nothing. I have a purpose, a goal. I have the knowledge and skills to make a difference in this world. I can't let that go to waste just because I'm dead.\"\nHu Tao sneered. \"Your skills and knowledge mean nothing here. You're nothing but a dead man, and that's all you'll ever be.\"\n\nFilon's patience was wearing thin. He could see that Hu Tao was not going to listen to reason, and he knew that he had to take matters into his own hands.\n\n\"You are no match for me, Filon,\" Hu Tao sneered, her eyes flashing with anger. \"I am the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and I have the power to erase your very existence.\"\n\nFilon knew that Hu Tao was not bluffing. She had the power to erase his memories and send him back to the border, trapping him once again in the realm of the dead. But he was not about to let that happen. With a fierce determination, he summoned all his strength and prepared to do battle.\n\n\"If that's how you feel, then I have no choice but to defend myself,\" Filon said, his voice calm but firm.\n\nHu Tao laughed. \"You think you can take me on? I am the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and I have powers beyond your understanding. You stand no chance against me.\"\n\nFilon was undaunted. He knew that he had the power and the skills to defeat Hu Tao, and he was determined to use them to protect himself and his goals.\n\nThe two clashed, their powerful auras colliding in a violent explosion of energy. Filon fought with all his might, using his knowledge of science and technology to unleash a barrage of electrical attacks that caught Hu Tao off guard. She fought back with all her strength, her Pyro abilities proving to be a formidable match for Filon's own.\n\nBut Filon was not to be underestimated. He fought with a fierce determination, his calm and collected demeanor belaying the sheer power he possessed. He used his abilities to control the very electricity that flowed through his veins, creating powerful blasts of energy that sent Hu Tao flying.\n\nIn the end, it was Filon who emerged victorious. Hu Tao lay on the ground, her body broken and battered, as Filon stood at the exit of the border, ready to make his escape and start a new life, he was stopped by the sight of Hu Tao blocking his path. She stood with a grave expression, flowing white robes billowing around her in the wind.\n\n\"You cannot leave,\" Hu Tao said, her voice cold and firm. \"You are not supposed to be here. It is against the natural order of things.\"\n\nFilon tried to reason with her, explaining that he had no intention of causing any harm or disruption to the balance of the world. He just wanted to live a normal life and make a positive contribution to society.\n\nBut Hu Tao was unmoved by his words. \"You do not understand,\" she said. \"Your very existence here is a threat. I cannot allow you to leave and reveal the secrets of this place to the living.\"\nShe raised her hand and a bright light began to glow around her palm. Filon knew immediately what she intended to do \u2013 erase his memory and send him back to the border, a mindless ghost doomed to wander the realms of the dead forever.\n\nFilon's aura, however, was strong and his powers too great to be overcome by Hu Tao's attempt at mind control. The light flickered and died, and Hu Tao's expression turned to one of shock and anger.\n\n\"You will not get away with this,\" she snarled, drawing her sword. \"I will not let you leave and ruin everything I have worked for.\"\n\nFilon knew he had no choice but to fight. He summoned his powers, his hair growing longer and his eyes glowing with energy as he prepared to defend himself. Hu Tao attacked fiercely, her sword flashing through the air as she tried to strike Filon down.\n\nBut Filon was more than a match for her. He moved with lightning speed, dodging and weaving around her attacks as he countered with powerful blasts of electricity. He used his technical knowledge to build and summon various gadgets and machines to aid in the fight, all the while keeping his calm and focusing on the task at hand.\n\nHu Tao was no amateur fighter, but Filon's superior skills and powers proved to be too much for her. She stumbled and fell, her sword clattering to the ground as Filon stood over her, panting and triumphant.\n\n\"It is over,\" Filon said, his voice filled with sadness and regret. \"I did not want it to come to this, but you left me no choice.\"\n\nHu Tao lay on the ground, defeated. Filon knew that he had no choice but to kill her, as she would never stop trying to stop him. He hesitated for a moment, not wanting to take a life, but in the end he knew it was necessary for his own survival. He raised his hand and sent a final burst of electricity coursing through Hu Tao's body, ending her life.\n\nThe Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, without a person to take over as director, collapses, and news of the mysterious newcomer slowly spreads around the world. Filon, feeling both guilty and relieved, sets off on a journey to make a new life for himself and find a way to make amends for the life he had taken.\n\nFilon decides to go to Mondstadt, as he has heard that it is a nation full of freedom and opportunity. He believes that he will be able to use his technical knowledge and superpowers to make a positive impact in the nation, and he is excited to explore all that Mondstadt has to offer. Additionally, the city's beauty and atmosphere appeal to Filon, and he feels drawn to its culture and values. Overall, Filon believes that Mondstadt is the perfect place for him to start his new life and make a difference in the world of Teyvat."}, {"Prompt Length": 3502, "Output Length": 88, "prompt": "EXERCISE 2\nThe Bridge\nThe bridge accomplishes several things. It wakes up the gluteal muscles (the big muscles in your buttocks). It reinforces spinal stabilization. It builds endurance and strength in the muscles on the front and back of the core. And it is the precursor to doing a proper squat, which comes later in the book. \nDo the bridge as follows:\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Bend your knees and put your feet in a flexed position so that your heels are on the ground and the balls of your feet and toes are off of the ground as pictured.\nStep 4: Squeeze your buttocks together as if you were trying to pinch a coin between them.\n\nStep 5: Here\u2019s the tricky part: Using the glutes, lift your hips/torso off of the ground without moving your lower back. You should not articulate the spine and roll up \u201cone vertebra at a time.\u201d You want to do the opposite of that. You want to lift the torso in one solid piece while maintaining your neutral spine. No movement should take place in the lower back.\nStep 6: Hold for five to ten seconds (remember these are suggestions. Hold to your tolerance in the beginning, with ten seconds being your goal). You should feel the muscles in both sides of your buttocks working relatively equally.\nStep 7: Lower your back down to the starting position without losing your neutral spine. Again, do not articulate the spine on the way down. In other words, do not roll the spine down onto the floor one vertebra at a time.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 2 through 7, and do five to ten reps, with ten being your long-term goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Hamstring cramping. If your hamstrings cramp (the muscles that run down the underside of your thighs), gently push your feet into the floor away from you before you lift your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Knee pain. If one or both of your knees hurt, lightly press your knees outward before lifting your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Unable to maintain neutral spine. Start by trying to lift your hips/torso only an inch off the ground. Slowly progress to a full bridge over the next few weeks.\n\u2022 Unable to feel glutes working. Go to Chapter 13. Then come back and start with the following regression.\n\u2022 If your back hurts with this exercise, proceed to the Buttock Squeezes regression on the next page. Try these for a few days or weeks and then come back and try the bridge again, making sure to follow instructions meticulously. If your back still hurts, you may have a spinal condition like severe stenosis that makes you sensitive to extension in the spine. If this is the case, this exercise might not be for you.\nCommon Mistakes\nThe most common mistake for back patients with the bridge exercise is that they use their hamstrings instead of their glutes to bring the hips up into position. If your hamstrings are cramping, then you aren\u2019t using your glutes enough. Go to Chapter 13 and practice \u201cwaking up your glutes,\u201d and then come back to this exercise and try it again.\nREGRESSION\nButtock Squeezes\nIf you don\u2019t have the strength or control yet to perform a single bridge exercise properly for any amount of time, start with buttock squeezes.\n1. Lie on your back, with arms at your side, knees bent, feet hip-width apart.\n2. Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your buttocks together as if trying to squeeze a coin between them.\n4. Hold for ten seconds.\n5. Do ten reps.\nPROGRESSION\nOne-Leg Bridge\nOnce you have mastered the bridge and are able to do it with relative ease and with no discomfort in the back, you may want to progress to the one-leg bridge. You do not have to progress to this exercise. Depending on your spinal condition and your fitness level, you may not need to progress this far. This progression is for those who are reasonably fit and plan to be very active in sports, exercise, or outdoor activities.\n1. Follow all rules for the bridge.\n2. Once your hips and torso are off the ground, give extra care to make sure your core is braced as firmly as possible.\n\n3. Slowly extend one leg at the knee without letting the hips/torso drop on that side. You will feel the glutes of the other stabilizing leg kick in as you extend the leg.\n4. Hold five to ten seconds.\n5. Slowly bring the extended leg back to the bent-knee starting position. (Do not lower your hips/torso while doing this. Maintain the bridge position with a neutral spine until your foot is back on the floor.)\n6. Slowly lower your hips/torso back to the starting position on the floor without articulating the spine.\n7. On the other side, repeat Steps 1 through 6, making sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your core in place before extending the leg at the knee.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 When you go to one leg, it is easy to \u201ccock\u201d your hips to one side, to make it easier. Don\u2019t do that. Keep your thighs parallel during the whole exercise. If you can\u2019t, you aren\u2019t strong enough yet for this exercise.\n\u2022 Regarding extending the leg as you come up/bending the leg down as you go down: Make sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your spine before you try to extend the leg. Conversely, make sure you bring the leg all the way back in before coming down to the starting position.\n\u2022 Do not bring the thigh of the extended leg up. Make sure your thighs remain parallel so that you have to use the gluteal muscles to keep the pelvis stable.\nEXERCISE 3\nCrunch and Plank\nWe discuss these two exercises together because they both do a lot of the same things, and some of you will not get to the plank and that\u2019s okay. The plank will take you a bit further toward returning to strenuous activities, but the crunch is enough to get you out of pain. The purpose of the crunch and the plank is to build endurance and strength in the abdominal wall (crunch and plank) and glutes and lats (plank) and to increase spinal stability. Very few back pain sufferers are strong enough to do a plank properly in the beginning and must do crunches for a while before attempting the plank.\nCrunch\nFirst of all, this exercise is not a sit-up. Sit-ups (the traditional \u201cArmy sit-up,\u201d where you pull yourself into a full sitting position) have been proven to be very risky to the spine. They run dangerous loads through the lumbar discs. If you wanted to develop a way to herniate a disc in a lab, a sit-up would be a good candidate for it. Crunches, unlike full sit-ups, do not allow movement in the lumbar spine. Your lumbar spine stays in neutral throughout.\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Place your hands behind your head, if possible. If you can\u2019t, because of shoulder discomfort, that\u2019s okay. Find a comfortable position for your hands.\nStep 4: Gently draw your chin in toward your neck, giving yourself a \u201cdouble chin.\u201d Hold this position throughout the exercise.\nStep 5: Slowly and carefully raise your shoulder blades and head toward the ceiling an inch or two, giving a moderate squeeze in the abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your lower back. Keep a neutral spine; this will be harder than you think. Only bring your shoulders off the floor as far as you can without moving your lower back. The max distance, when you\u2019re great at it, would be no more than, say, four inches.\n\nStep 6: Hold five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nStep 7: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your lower back.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 1 through 7, for five to ten reps, with ten being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u201cMy neck hurts.\u201d First, you shouldn\u2019t be pulling your head with your arms. Your arms/hands are there only to provide a little support to your head and neck. Make sure that you pull your chin in toward your neck before initiating the exercise. This will engage your deep neck flexors that support the spine. If this does not relieve neck pain, move to the Regression.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 The most common mistake is flattening or (worse) rounding the back. It is crucial that you not make this mistake. Doing crunches while continually rounding or flattening the back will promote spinal instability, the opposite of our goal. Details matter!\n\u2022 Chin jutting. If your chin is poking out toward the ceiling with each rep, you are not stabilizing your cervical spine and your neck extensors are taking over. Make sure to draw the chin in toward your neck before each rep.\nREGRESSION\nAbdominal Contractions\nDo this exercise until you build up enough abdominal strength to accomplish the crunch.\n1. Start in the same position as for the bridge.\n2. Place one hand behind your lower back and one hand inside your front hipbone beside your navel.\n3. Squeeze your abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your back. You should feel your back being still with one hand and the abs engaging with the other hand.\n4. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n5. Repeat for several reps until fatigue sets in.\nPROGRESSION\nPlank\nOnce you have mastered the crunch and are able to do crunches with relative ease and without pain or movement in the lower back, try the plank. This is a great exercise to build increased core stability, endurance, and strength. Some of you (especially those with severe stenosis) may never be able to do a plank. That\u2019s okay. Give the plank a try, and if it doesn\u2019t work for you, stay with crunches. If you do go on to the plank, follow the directions closely; most people do this exercise incorrectly.\n\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent and palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders.\n5. Lift your knees off of the floor so you are now on your toes and forearms.\n6. \u201cTraction\u201d your forearms into the floor. In other words, press them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and down toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n\n7. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n8. Slowly put your knees back down first. Do not let your hips/pelvis go to the floor first; this would put your back into extension and may cause pain.\n9. Repeat Steps 1 through 8, for two to five reps, with five being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my lower back.\u201d Some people just can\u2019t do a plank. Even if they do it the right way, it still aggravates their back. If you can\u2019t do a plank, drop it and stick with crunches. But first, be sure that you can\u2019t do it. For example, if your lower back is hurting, try sticking your buttocks in the air a little more. It could be that your hips are sagging toward the floor, putting your back into extension. Also, make sure the core is fully engaged before moving from knees to toes. Lastly, make sure you are squeezing your buttocks, which will support the lower back. If none of that works, forget it; stick with crunches.\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my shoulders.\u201d Make sure you are tractioning your forearms down into the floor and back toward your toes. This engages the supportive muscles of the rotator cuff. If this doesn\u2019t help, try the regression that follows.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 Feet and legs are not together, which makes gluteal engagement more difficult.\n\u2022 Back is up but the hips are dropping toward the floor. This will cause back pain in people with conditions such as stenosis or facet syndrome.\n\u2022 You\u2019re forgetting to pull shoulders back and forearms into the floor with chin jutting. This will cause an increase in pressure in the shoulders and/or neck, resulting in shoulder and neck pain.\nREGRESSION\nPlank on Knees\nIf you aren\u2019t quite ready for plank but think crunch is just too easy, try this one.\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent, palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders (see illustration, for the plank).\n5. Traction your forearms into the floor, pulling them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and back toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n6. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nEXERCISE 4\nDynamic Hamstring Stretch\nCAUTION\nThis exercise may irritate symptoms of people with active radiculopathy, such as severe leg/foot pain, and numbness or tingling in the legs or feet. If you have these symptoms, start with caution; you may not be able to do this exercise. If this exercise exacerbates your leg or back symptoms, skip it for now and come back to it when the symptoms are resolved.\nThe dynamic hamstring stretch helps to improve mobility in the hips and also helps to reinforce and strengthen your ability to maintain a neutral spine while moving the legs. It also builds endurance and strength in the core.\nStep 1: Lie on your back and find neutral spine.\nStep 2: Brace the core to lock in neutral spine.\n\nStep 3: Bend one leg at the knee with your foot flat on floor. Straighten out the other leg onto the floor, with foot flexed (toes pointed up).\nStep 4: Carefully raise the straight leg without losing your neutral spine; in other words, make sure your lower back isn\u2019t flattening into the floor as your leg comes up. To check, put one of your hands underneath your lower back and feel for movement. Raise the leg only as high as you can without flattening your back into the floor. \nStep 5: Do ten to twenty repetitions on each leg. Do as many as needed to feel that you have mildly stretched your hamstrings and worked your core.\nCommon Mistake\nFlattening the back into the floor as you bring the leg up. Remember, one of the most important points of these exercises is to teach you neutral spine/spinal stability. You do not want to accomplish an increase of movement speed at the expense of spinal stabilization. Bring up your leg only as high as you can without flattening your back or bending your knee. Increasing hamstring flexibility will come with time.\nEXERCISE 5\nSide Plank\nThe side plank works the muscles on the lateral (side) parts of the core, such as the obliques, gluteus medius, and quadratus lumborum. This exercise is a very important one. I mention this because almost everyone hates doing it. But don\u2019t give up: Your back depends on it. Many readers will not be able to do this exercise at first because their core is weak. Don\u2019t worry. There are regressions (easier exercises) for those of you who can\u2019t do this one yet.\nStep 1: Start by lying on your side, propped up on your forearm, with your elbow under your shoulder. Relax the other arm for now. Pull your lower arm shoulder blade inward toward your spine and downward toward your buttocks, engaging the lat muscles.\nStep 2: Drop your hips back a bit so that they sit behind your feet and shoulders."}, {"Prompt Length": 3397, "Output Length": 48, "prompt": "read this Sitcome\n\nDefining the Genre\nSo, what is a situational comedy? As the sitcom clich\u00e9 goes, Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u2018sitcom\u2019 as:\n\u2018a radio or television comedy series that involves a continuing cast of characters in a succession of episodes\u2019\u00a0\nSo a sitcom is simply a comedy in a situation. Frequently, this incorporates an ensemble cast of characters, who rarely change and rarely develop. The Simpsons is a sitcom which best exemplifies this lack of change as even after 30 years, the central characters are still the same age, in the same house, in the same town and even in the same clothes.\nThe situation is the place to start when writing a sitcom. The location and the cast of characters is vital to fuelling the comedy.\nSo, the \u2018precinct\u2019 or primary setting. This will be the starting point for the controlling idea of the show. When it comes to precincts there are three typical types of locations in which a sitcom can be situated.\n\\* The workplace\n\\* A home\n\\* A combination of the two\n\u00a0\n1. Workplace\nBrooklyn Nine Nine uses a literal precinct in the form of the 99th Police Precinct. This is classed as a workplace situation comedy and features police officers in their various roles.\nOther examples of workplace sitcoms include the TV studio in 30 Rock, the bars in It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Cheers, the basement filled with nerds in The IT Crowd, the various political buildings and offices in Veep and The Thick of it and\u00a0the offices in The Office and\u00a0Parks and Recreation.\nThe concept of the workplace could also be less literal and include schools, universities and colleges, as in Bad Education and\u00a0Community.\u00a0The casts are therefore work colleagues or a work \u2018family\u2019.\nTo create an example, a sitcom could be set in a pizzeria, which is a place of work that would allow for a central cast of pizza chefs, owners, and waiters. But it could also feature recurring characters such as customers and delivery drivers.\n\nBest Cold Opens | Parks and Recreation\n\n[![Best Cold Opens | Parks and Recreation](https://industrialscripts.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Feey-wOyTOJs%2F0.jpg)  \nWatch this video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/eey-wOyTOJs)\n2. Home\nThe home precinct is demonstrated in the aforementioned eternal sitcom The Simpsons, and in a number of other shows based around where people live.\nThese types of sitcoms include Friends, New Girl, Seinfeld,\u00a0Modern Family,\u00a0What We Do In The Shadows and Spaced.\nThe primary location of each of these shows is a place where people live. Therefore, the casts consist of biological families or makeshift families formed of roommates or friends.\n\n3. Multiple Precincts\nThe precinct is not always the only location and almost all shows include a number of bases for the characters to interact in, both in private and public.\n\\* Frasier includes the radio station and Frasier\u2019s apartment as the two main bases but also frequently features a coffee shop.\n\\* Friends also centres around two neighbouring apartments and a coffee shop.\n\\* The school is the meeting place of the main characters in The Inbetweeners,\u00a0but the show itself rarely centres within the school. Each episode focuses more on the characters being put into a new situation such as a theme park trip, night out or work experience.\nIt is rare that a sitcom only centres on one place. But it is vital for your own sitcom writing experience that the characters have a location where they can all meet. There, they can link up to go on a variety of antics.\nHowever, a precinct doesn\u2019t make it a sitcom. So far, all we have is a part of the situation. Unless you have comedic characters you\u2019ve just written something more akin to a soap opera.\n\u00a0\nFunny People\nA sitcom will not succeed unless it has characters who are funny. Funny can\u2019t be the characters primary defintion though. The comedy has to come from somewhere intrinsically tied to who that character is.\nWhen writing comedic characters, Judd Apatow often starts by reading self-help books, which allow him to think psychologically about his characters and build them from flaws and insecurities. This is a good example of how even comedic characters need depth.\n\u00a0\nComedic Conflict\nA basis of contradictory personalities and conflict is integral to every sitcom and to comedy in general. It is the first thing you should be considering when creating your characters in your sitcom.\nTo continue the earlier pizzeria example, it is important to create a makeshift family that all contradict each other. This may mean ensuring that one pizza chef is an Italian pizza purist, while another is an advocate of hot dog stuffed crusts, for example.\n\n\u00a0\nDifferent Forms of Sitcoms\nAnother important consideration to take into account when writing a sitcom is what form it will take. This will determine how the script will be written. Forms of sitcom include:\nSingle-Camera\n\\* These are the simplest to write and follow dramatic writing conventions, as seen in Atlanta, New Girl, Gavin and Stacey.\n\\* Many shows use the single-camera form as an opportunity to create filmic episodes, giving the writer more scope to incorporate homages to other films and genres as seen in Community and Spaced.\n\\* The misleadingly named single-camera form usually uses more than one camera, but is shot without an audience.\nMulti-Camera\n\\* These are often studio shows, shot in front of a live audience.\n\\* A consideration when writing is to leave spaces between jokes to allow for audience laughter.\n\\* Examples include: Friends, Frasier, The Big Bang Theory, The IT Crowd.\nAnimated\n\\* Similarly to single-camera, the animated sitcom allows for more creativity. For example, the use of surrealist jokes. After all, anything that can be created can be drawn.\n\\* Examples include: The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, Family Guy, BoJack Horseman.\nComedic Genres\nThere are many different comedic genres within comedy. Sitcoms often use a combination of styles and genres within them.\nWatching and studying shows like those listed below will give you a good understanding of the potential breadth of genre within the crafting of a sitcom:\n\\* Mockumentary \u2013 eg. The Office,\u00a0Parks and Recreation, Modern Family, What We Do In The Shadows\n\\* Wit and Wordplay \u2013 eg. Frasier, Seinfeld,\u00a0How I Met Your Mother\n\\* Slapstick and Farce \u2013 eg. Fawlty Towers, Friday Night Dinner,\u00a0Arrested Development\n\\* Deadpan \u2013 eg. Flight of The Conchords\n\\* Spoof and Homage \u2013 eg.\u00a0Community, The Simpsons, Spaced\n\\* Satire \u2013 eg. The Thick of It, Veep, W1A, Avenue 5\n\\* Surreal \u2013 eg. BoJack Horseman,\u00a0Family Guy, The Mighty Boosh\n\\* Dark Comedy \u2013 eg. Black Books, It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\n\\* Blue Comedy \u2013 eg. The Inbetweeners,\u00a0Catastrophe\n\\* Cringe \u2013 eg. The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm\nIt\u2019s important always to link the genre of your sitcom to your core values and intensions. These different comedic genres can have different functions. When misapplied or inappropriate their strength can feel undermined.\n\\* For example, The Office is about the minutiae of office life and the ego of the central character desperately trying to impress the omnipresent documentary crew. So a mockumentary format is perfect for this idea.\n\\* Whilst Spaced is about\u00a0a group of aimless young adults saturated in popular culture. So to have it spoof and homage other films and genres makes perfect sense.\n\u00a0\nThe Sitcom Story Structure\nSitcom story structure can be viewed similarly to the scriptwriting of any television show or film,\u00a0 just condensed to a 22-30 minute script. When writing a sitcom the three-act structure can be applied as with every other genre of film or TV. This isn\u2019t a strict rule but a helpful guide to follow.\nFriends Season 1 Episode 5: The One with the East German Laundry Detergent demonstrates sitcom story structure well as it has three separate plots that all rapidly go through the three-act structure. It demonstrates how sitcoms both use the traditional film three-act structure but also have unique elements to their form as well.\n\u00a0\nFirst Act:\nThe friends are all gathered in the coffee shop. During the first act, they split up into pairs, creating three separate plots with two main characters in each.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel agree to meet and do laundry. Ross is nervous when he convinces himself that it is a date and wants it to go well. Rachel wants to do her own laundry to feel independent.\nB Plot: Chandler wants to break up with his girlfriend, Janice. Phoebe wants to break up with her boyfriend, Tony.\nC Plot: Joey wants to take his ex-girlfriend, Angela, on a date. So, he convinces Angela to go on a double date. Angela and her new boyfriend will go on a double date with Joey and Monica. However, Joey tells Monica that Bob is actually Angela\u2019s brother, so Monica thinks she\u2019s being set up with Bob.\nSecond Act:\nAll three subplots go through mild, comedic obstacles to achieve their goals, which were established in the first act.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel go to the laundrette. Ross defends Rachel\u2019s washing machine from being taken by a \u2018horrible woman\u2019. Ross proceeds to teach her to do laundry. Rachel\u2019s laundry doesn\u2019t go well and everything turns pink.\nB Plot: Phoebe easily breaks up with her boyfriend while Chandler is unable to break up with Janice. Chandler breaks the news to Janice and she reacts negatively.\nC Plot: Joey continues to conceal the motives behind the double date. He plants the seeds for Bob to break up with Angela by highlighting Angela\u2019s unappealing traits while he acts as a wingman for Monica. Monica and Angela go to the bathroom together and discuss Bob.\n\nThird Act:\nA Plot: Rachel stands up to the horrible woman proving her independence and Ross and Rachel briefly kiss. Ross then bumps his head on a washing machine door. During the End Tag, Rachel is icing Ross\u2019 head.\nB Plot: Phoebe intervenes in Chandler\u2019s break up and Janice leaves happily. During the End Tag, Chandler runs through the streets celebrating his newfound freedom.\nC Plot: Joey confesses to Monica that Bob and Angela aren\u2019t siblings and the two agree to break the couple up. During the End Tag, Joey and Monica return from their date, overjoyed at having \u201cripped that couple apart\u201d.\nEveryone is basically in the same position as they were in when the episode started. They have gone through minor changes but are ultimately all still sat in the coffee shop together. The story has gone in a circle.\n\u00a0\nOther Examples and Structures\nDan Harmon, creator of Community\u00a0and\u00a0Rick and Morty handily adapted the 3-act structure into a story circle. The situation is allowed to change over the course of the episode but ultimately the characters are unchanged and in relatively the same position.\nHarmon\u2019s story circle is partially based on the \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d and blueprints a successful structure for a sitcom.\n\n1. A character is in their comfort zone or regular situation (the precinct),\n2. But they want or need something else,\n3. They go into an unfamiliar situation or cross a threshold,\n4. The character adapts to the situation while facing trials and obstacles,\n5. Finding what they wanted, whether they like it or not,\n6. But the new situation \u201ckicks their ass\u201d and forces them to pay the price,\n7. Then they return to their familiar situation (the precinct),\n8. The events of the episode have changed them. In sitcom, this is rarely drastic.\nSitcoms are only 22-30 minutes long and thus the story structure is compressed and the story is almost on fast forward.\n\u00a0\nWrite What You Know \u2013 But Make it Funny\nOne of the most common pieces of advice that people seem to tell you when writing is to write what you know. This is also true in sitcom, but as always, it doesn\u2019t mean you can only write about yourself.\nTake funny situations that happen to you and put your characters in the same situation, adapt the story of your life. If you meet someone that makes you laugh \u2013 write a similar character to them in to your medieval sitcom.\n\u00a0\nHow to Actually Write A Sitcom Script\nIn terms of how to write a screenplay, the writing process of a sitcom script is similar to any other script. However, there are a few ways in which a sitcom script may vary. Consider the following elements of a sitcom script:\n\\* The Cold Open \u2013 This is an opportunity to include a joke which doesn\u2019t play into the rest of the episode as a comedic hook to draw in a new audience.\n\\* The End Tag \u2013 Very similar to the cold open but at the end of the episode. Often it is a payoff to a small set-up from earlier in the episode. But it can also be an entirely original joke involving one or two characters (Troy and Abed often serve this purpose in Community).\n\\* Use of Flashbacks/Cutaways \u2013\u00a0Family Guy, 30 Rock and most mockumentaries frequently use flashbacks and cutaways for quick punchlines and gags.\n\\* Callbacks and Running Jokes \u2013\u00a0Arrested Development\u00a0is a particularly excellent series for having jokes that pop up in different iterations throughout the series. It\u2019s a kind of language that show itself will create and repeatedly use throughout.\n\\* Fast Paced Scenes \u2013 Scenes in sitcoms are rarely long, 1-2 pages per scene or set-up is fairly standard as it keeps the pace moving quickly and you can move on to the next joke or comedic setup quickly.\n\u00a0\nRe-Draft to Make It Funnier\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your script, workshop it with people. Read it through aloud and see which bits are funny and which bits need work. Then, re-write, re-read, re-workshop your script.\nThis process will have developed it into something that, at the very least, you and your workshop find funny. If it makes you laugh, chances are it\u2019ll make a few other people laugh.\nPerhaps more than most genres, comedy is hard to get right without finding out if it works with an audience. This is even more relevant in a sitcom. So sharing your work with others and seeing how it plays to a room (however big or small that room may be) is a vital step in the process.\n\u00a0\nAnd Finally\u2026 Don\u2019t forget to Defy Genre\nWhen writing a sitcom, remember to innovate and create a genre hybrid. Combining elements of different genres and forms can create interesting and exciting new ideas.\n\\* What We Do In The Shadows, for example, combines a house-share, a mockumentary and a world in which supernatural creatures exist.\n\\* Peep Show\u00a0takes a flat share and gives the main characters internal monologues.\n\\* Community\u00a0takes a number of different genres and uses them throughout the series to create different innovative episodes within the sitcom genre.\nInnovation makes the sitcom and your script stand out. This guide has given you the outline of what a sitcom is, how it works and how to write one.\nIt\u2019s also important to know that as with everything else, these rules can and sometimes should be broken. If you want to write a sitcom about a pizzeria then do it. If you want to stray further from the norms and set this pizzeria in a medieval kingdom, that is your prerogative.\nInnovation is important and so is enjoying what you\u2019re writing. So write what you know, and write what you like. If your enthusiasm for the idea jumps off the page, then it will be of interest to like-minded people.\nSitcoms are there to make us laugh, comfort us and re-unite us every night with characters we\u2019ve grown to know. It\u2019s vital that in a genre with these intentions, these elements are baked into to the writing."}, {"Prompt Length": 3357, "Output Length": 75, "prompt": "Describe as reporting live a current event in 3 lines, what is happening right now using the following tweets :\n\nsourceText Time\nWhat a goal , beautiful 2-0 #FIFAWorldCup argetina dominating , france are clueless 15:36:49.0000000\n?????? beautiful goal #ARGFRA 15:36:51.0000000\nThat was just a beautiful team goal for Argentina\u2019s 2nd 15:35:56.0000000\nArgentina 2nd goal was beautiful ?? 15:36:50.0000000\nArgentina second goal is pure class omg .

The survey was distributed by Miles, owner of The Trenton Journal, to people in his network, including the nonprofit community foundation for which he also works, as well as prominent churches. Miles also posted a link to the survey in his newsletter and on his website. As in Paterson, we also created a printed flyer with the survey link and a QR code. Because of the financial incentive, we had a number of false responses by bots or people trying to game the drawing, which we also saw in Paterson. The final N, after cleaning, was 119 (recall that all questions were optional, so the numbers reported below often do not add up to 119).\n\nThe survey respondents were distributed evenly among the four wards of Trenton; this suggests that Trenton Journal\u2019s coverage of the four wards should be roughly equal. \n\nTable 1: Where survey respondents live\nEast Ward \nNorth Ward\nSouth Ward\nWest Ward\n21\n25\n23\n22\nThe graphic below shows how long the respondents have lived in Trenton. There is marked variation here depending on the ward; in the West, South and North wards, more than 65% of residents have lived there for at least six years, while in the south ward more than 55% of residents have been there for at least 11 years, showing depth of connection to the community. The East ward is the most evenly distributed and has the greatest percentage of residents who have been there for less than a year; notably, all of the respondents from the North ward have lived there for at least a year. The focus group respondents also tended to be people who have lived in the city for a decade or longer (we did not differentiate their answers by ward).\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nIn general, the respondents who live in Trenton\u2019s South Ward stood out as having different experiences and opinions in many cases, compared to residents of other wards. Perhaps surprisingly, given how long people have lived in the area, they were much more likely to say their community is a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d place to live (43%). For comparison, only 23% of the East Ward, 19% of the West Ward, and 20% of the North Ward residents said the same (see graphic below). Because of this and other marked differences, the responses of South Ward residents were considered separately for the analysis.\n\nRespondents from the West ward were generally happiest with their community\u2019s quality of life, with more than half stating that Trenton is a good or excellent place to live, followed by respondents from the East and North wards, where roughly half think the same. By contrast, nearly half of respondents from the South ward said Trenton is a poor or terrible place to live, and the fewest calling it a fair place to live, showing the strongest division of opinion on the question. \n\nWe asked people to describe the community in one sentence. Some of the responses were negative:\n\nThere are a lot of empty houses in my neighborhood.\nLack of police presence.\nLots of crime and gangs.\n\nBut others struck a balanced and nuanced view of the strengths and challenges:\nEclectic mix of good and bad.\nTrenton should be so much nicer than it is, but it is well located and there is lots in the surrounding area that is wonderful.\nA good community where good people and good news is lost in the bad press and violence by a few in the community.\nYou can see the beauty within the struggle.\nIt depends where you live in the community.\n\nPeople in both focus groups acknowledged problems with the area \u2013 lack of repairs to facilities and problems accessing public information came up several times \u2013 but also emphasized the many positive sides of Trenton and of the people who live there. They wanted to hear more about these positive stories and have easier access to public information to fix the things that are wrong; these comments informed the recommendations that we made to the publisher (listed below).\n\nWhat are Trenton\u2019s information needs?\n\nAbout 6 in 10 survey respondents said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to keep up with local news. Meanwhile, 40% said it is harder today to keep up with local news compared to three years ago. Only 23% said it was easier. The focus group participants reported following news at the national, state and local levels, usually through mass media such as cable news networks or the evening news. Both survey and focus group participants said they would be excited about a local news source that filled the existing information gaps in Trenton. \n\nSatisfaction/concern\n\nOne survey question asked whether each topic is a significant source of either satisfaction or concern in the community. On many topics, the respondents from Trenton disagreed. The most polarizing issue was crime and safety: 33% feel crime is high and they are unsafe there, while 46% of people think the opposite. \n\nThere were four topics where at least 15% of the people strongly agreed but another at least 15% strongly disagreed:\nCrime is low/high.\nEntertainment options are good/bad.\nJobs are satisfactory/unsatisfactory.\nThe environment is clean/unclean.\n\nAdditionally, local government and politics was the issue most people had an opinion about. Only 10% said this was not important to them. Fifty percent agreed that local officials are effective and trustworthy, while 33% disagreed. The responses to these topic-based questions suggested to us that the Journal will want to be even-handed in its coverage, especially of these divisive local topics.\n\nSome topics, however, evoked agreement:\nThe community\u2019s history. A total of 32% strongly agreed and 60% at least somewhat agreed that Trenton has history and traditions to be proud of.\nSports. A total of 58% agreed that local sports are fun and exciting to follow, while only 21% disagreed.\nSocial issues. A total of 56% agreed that the community shares their values on issues like race, immigration, and abortion.\n\nAnother survey question asked, \u201cHow important is it for you personally to read the following types of information in the Trenton Journal?\u201d\n\nRespondents said the most important topics of coverage were crime, sports, health care, and local government. There were large groups who were \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in other topics: entertainment options, local history and traditions, and local arts and culture. Twenty-six percent said that family life is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them.\nHow people use and access local news\n\nTo better understand The Trenton Journal community\u2019s information needs and the motivations that drive them to seek out local news, we asked them to name the most important reasons they follow local news. The top response was \u201cto stay informed and be a better citizen\u201d (37%). \n\nAfter that nearly a third of respondents said they use local news for entertainment, hobbies, and sports (33%), or to \u201cfind places to go and things to do\u201d (30%). Twenty-eight percent said local news helped them in their job and 26% said it helped them stay safe and avoid crime. These answers point to the importance of \u201cservice journalism,\u201d a simple but extremely practical and helpful practice.\n\nThere were a few most-common ways that survey respondents discover local news in Trenton. Each of these is used every day by 3 in 10 survey respondents, and at least weekly by 50 to 60% of them:\nFrom friends / family.\nGoogle searches.\nReading Facebook News Feed.\nReading Facebook Groups.\n\nFacebook is a major factor in the local news ecosystem of the survey respondents. Nearly 8 in 10 are getting local news and information there regularly. Half use Facebook for news at least once a week. Notably, the everyday news engagement is slightly stronger for Facebook Groups than for Facebook News Feed.\n\nFrequency of use for news\nFacebook News Feed\nFacebook Group\nEvery day\n23%\n28%\nWeekly or more\n55%\n51%\nA few times a month or more\n78%\n67%\nSeparately, we asked people how satisfied they are with various local news sources, including some Facebook Groups. The Facebook Groups ranked higher in satisfaction than any other news source. For example the Group named \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d rated highly, with 25% saying they \u201clove it and use it all the time\u201d and a total of 60% saying they at least \u201cfind it useful and use it sometimes.\u201d Another 18% \u201cdon\u2019t love it, but \u201cuse it when I have to.\u201d Only 10% avoid it and 12% never heard of or used it. The Group named \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton\u201d was more polarizing: 28% \u201clove it\u201d and 16% \u201cdislike\u201d it. Nonetheless, 50% of respondents find it useful sometimes and 65% at least use it when they have to. Focus group participants also reported accessing local news via Facebook, as well as from family/friends and from local television news, in particular on News 12 New Jersey.\n\nOther social networks are used by a smaller number of respondents, suggesting either that the Journal should be cautious about devoting too many scarce resources to other platforms or that the survey and focus groups did not reach community members who use these for local news and information.\n\nSocial network\nPercent using daily\nPercent using 1-2 times a week or more\nInstagram\n19%\n43%\nTwitter\n12%\n37%\nTikTok\n14%\n31%\n\nMeanwhile, about 45% of survey respondents use Trenton Journal social media accounts at least weekly, and 68% visit at least a few times a month. The other newspapers we asked about \u2014 The Trentonian, Trenton Daily, and The Times of Trenton \u2014 ranked lower in satisfaction; these may be secondary sources for some of the Journal\u2019s readers.\nWe also asked survey respondents to name any sources that they \u201ctrust the most for useful, reliable local news and information.\u201d There were a few individual responses to that question that might suggest nontraditional sources with whom the Journal may want to build relationships:\nLuz Esperanza y Vida organization.\nEast Trenton committee.\nTrenton Waves podcast.\nStreet ministries.\nThe Old Mill Hill Society.\n\nWhat people think of Trenton Journal\n\nRespondents generally enjoy Trenton Journal\u2019s content on social media: 21% \u201clove\u201d Trenton Journal social media and use it all the time. Another 41% (the most common answer) say Trenton Journal\u2019s social media is \u201cuseful and use it sometimes.\u201d Only 12% dislike its social accounts, and 12% haven\u2019t heard of them yet. Opinions were stronger among residents of the South Ward. They have a more favorable opinion of Trent Journal\u2019s social media accounts (32% \u201clove it\u201d, another 45% say \u201cuseful sometimes\u201d), and they rated Trenton Journal\u2019s social media accounts as more satisfying than any other local news source. \n\nTrenton Journal\u2019s website and emails were a bit less popular than their social media; still, a majority do find them useful. The website or emails are used by 47% at least weekly and at least 61% visit at least a few times a month. These somewhat contradictory findings should be explored in follow-up conversations with community members or further research.\n\nReader opinion\nTrenton Journal\u2019s \nsocial media accounts\nTrenton Journal\u2019s\n website and emails\n\u201cLove it, use it all the time\u201d\n21%\n19%\n\u201cI find it useful and use it sometimes\u201d\n41%\n39%\n\u201cI dislike it and avoid using it\u201d\n12%\n18%\nNever heard or it or used it\n12%\n9%\n\nWe asked the people familiar with Trenton Journal how well it does certain things. At least 60% of people think it does these things at least \u201cfairly well\u201d:\nIs fair to all sides.\nIs neutral and doesn't take positions on issues.\nActs as a watchdog of powerful institutions and people.\nMakes the news entertaining.\nProvides diverse points of view.\nMakes it easier to find important civic information.\nHelps people understand communities unlike their own.\nVerifies and gets the facts right.\n\nSlightly fewer people, about 55%, think it does these things at least fairly well:\nProvides forums for community discussions,\nReports on possible solutions to problems in society,\n\nAt the same time, a sizeable minority (about 40% of people) thought the Trenton Journal did those things poorly, so there is room to improve. \n\nAs part of the research design, we devised several recommendations for each publisher based on analysis of the data from the survey and focus groups. The recommendations we presented to the Trenton Journal are below, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\n\nRecommendations given to the Trenton Journal\n\nCreate a dedicated section for posting the dates and times of upcoming municipal meetings, similar to your events page; publicize it via your newsletter and social media.\nGo one step further and cover municipal meetings regularly, even if it\u2019s simply by providing a transcript.\nConsider adding a section on your website that lists all city and state departments, the services they provide, and their contact information.\nConsider offering different sub-pages for each ward, that can be tailored to the differing concerns and interest in each.\nEngage to a greater extent on Facebook, and be present on Facebook groups that are relevant in Trenton, especially \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d and \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton.\u201d\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, Trenton Journal decided to make the following changes:\n\nIncrease coverage of municipal meetings, the education system, and crime and safety.\n\nCreate a tab on the website\u2019s resource page to house publicly available data about the city.\n\nCreate an online directory of public officials and other power-holders in the city; increase coverage of them through profiles and interviews.\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them how often they visited Trenton Journal\u2019s website, how they felt about each of these changes, and for any other open-ended feedback they might provide. For each of the changes, we asked whether they agreed or disagreed with this change, and if they disagreed, what they\u2019d like to see done instead. Again the sample was disappointingly small (N=9), but generally positive.\n\nFour of the nine reported visiting the website daily, while three said they visit a few times a week and one said rarely. Perhaps not surprisingly (since the changes were based on community feedback), there was overwhelming agreement with the changes that Trenton Journal is making.

The survey was distributed by Miles, owner of The Trenton Journal, to people in his network, including the nonprofit community foundation for which he also works, as well as prominent churches. Miles also posted a link to the survey in his newsletter and on his website. As in Paterson, we also created a printed flyer with the survey link and a QR code. Because of the financial incentive, we had a number of false responses by bots or people trying to game the drawing, which we also saw in Paterson. The final N, after cleaning, was 119 (recall that all questions were optional, so the numbers reported below often do not add up to 119).\n\nThe survey respondents were distributed evenly among the four wards of Trenton; this suggests that Trenton Journal\u2019s coverage of the four wards should be roughly equal. \n\nTable 1: Where survey respondents live\nEast Ward \nNorth Ward\nSouth Ward\nWest Ward\n21\n25\n23\n22\nThe graphic below shows how long the respondents have lived in Trenton. There is marked variation here depending on the ward; in the West, South and North wards, more than 65% of residents have lived there for at least six years, while in the south ward more than 55% of residents have been there for at least 11 years, showing depth of connection to the community. The East ward is the most evenly distributed and has the greatest percentage of residents who have been there for less than a year; notably, all of the respondents from the North ward have lived there for at least a year. The focus group respondents also tended to be people who have lived in the city for a decade or longer (we did not differentiate their answers by ward).\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nIn general, the respondents who live in Trenton\u2019s South Ward stood out as having different experiences and opinions in many cases, compared to residents of other wards. Perhaps surprisingly, given how long people have lived in the area, they were much more likely to say their community is a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d place to live (43%). For comparison, only 23% of the East Ward, 19% of the West Ward, and 20% of the North Ward residents said the same (see graphic below). Because of this and other marked differences, the responses of South Ward residents were considered separately for the analysis.\n\nRespondents from the West ward were generally happiest with their community\u2019s quality of life, with more than half stating that Trenton is a good or excellent place to live, followed by respondents from the East and North wards, where roughly half think the same. By contrast, nearly half of respondents from the South ward said Trenton is a poor or terrible place to live, and the fewest calling it a fair place to live, showing the strongest division of opinion on the question. \n\nWe asked people to describe the community in one sentence. Some of the responses were negative:\n\nThere are a lot of empty houses in my neighborhood.\nLack of police presence.\nLots of crime and gangs.\n\nBut others struck a balanced and nuanced view of the strengths and challenges:\nEclectic mix of good and bad.\nTrenton should be so much nicer than it is, but it is well located and there is lots in the surrounding area that is wonderful.\nA good community where good people and good news is lost in the bad press and violence by a few in the community.\nYou can see the beauty within the struggle.\nIt depends where you live in the community.\n\nPeople in both focus groups acknowledged problems with the area \u2013 lack of repairs to facilities and problems accessing public information came up several times \u2013 but also emphasized the many positive sides of Trenton and of the people who live there. They wanted to hear more about these positive stories and have easier access to public information to fix the things that are wrong; these comments informed the recommendations that we made to the publisher (listed below).\n\nWhat are Trenton\u2019s information needs?\n\nAbout 6 in 10 survey respondents said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to keep up with local news. Meanwhile, 40% said it is harder today to keep up with local news compared to three years ago. Only 23% said it was easier. The focus group participants reported following news at the national, state and local levels, usually through mass media such as cable news networks or the evening news. Both survey and focus group participants said they would be excited about a local news source that filled the existing information gaps in Trenton. \n\nSatisfaction/concern\n\nOne survey question asked whether each topic is a significant source of either satisfaction or concern in the community. On many topics, the respondents from Trenton disagreed. The most polarizing issue was crime and safety: 33% feel crime is high and they are unsafe there, while 46% of people think the opposite. \n\nThere were four topics where at least 15% of the people strongly agreed but another at least 15% strongly disagreed:\nCrime is low/high.\nEntertainment options are good/bad.\nJobs are satisfactory/unsatisfactory.\nThe environment is clean/unclean.\n\nAdditionally, local government and politics was the issue most people had an opinion about. Only 10% said this was not important to them. Fifty percent agreed that local officials are effective and trustworthy, while 33% disagreed. The responses to these topic-based questions suggested to us that the Journal will want to be even-handed in its coverage, especially of these divisive local topics.\n\nSome topics, however, evoked agreement:\nThe community\u2019s history. A total of 32% strongly agreed and 60% at least somewhat agreed that Trenton has history and traditions to be proud of.\nSports. A total of 58% agreed that local sports are fun and exciting to follow, while only 21% disagreed.\nSocial issues. A total of 56% agreed that the community shares their values on issues like race, immigration, and abortion.\n\nAnother survey question asked, \u201cHow important is it for you personally to read the following types of information in the Trenton Journal?\u201d\n\nRespondents said the most important topics of coverage were crime, sports, health care, and local government. There were large groups who were \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in other topics: entertainment options, local history and traditions, and local arts and culture. Twenty-six percent said that family life is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them.\nHow people use and access local news\n\nTo better understand The Trenton Journal community\u2019s information needs and the motivations that drive them to seek out local news, we asked them to name the most important reasons they follow local news. The top response was \u201cto stay informed and be a better citizen\u201d (37%). \n\nAfter that nearly a third of respondents said they use local news for entertainment, hobbies, and sports (33%), or to \u201cfind places to go and things to do\u201d (30%). Twenty-eight percent said local news helped them in their job and 26% said it helped them stay safe and avoid crime. These answers point to the importance of \u201cservice journalism,\u201d a simple but extremely practical and helpful practice.\n\nThere were a few most-common ways that survey respondents discover local news in Trenton. Each of these is used every day by 3 in 10 survey respondents, and at least weekly by 50 to 60% of them:\nFrom friends / family.\nGoogle searches.\nReading Facebook News Feed.\nReading Facebook Groups.\n\nFacebook is a major factor in the local news ecosystem of the survey respondents. Nearly 8 in 10 are getting local news and information there regularly. Half use Facebook for news at least once a week. Notably, the everyday news engagement is slightly stronger for Facebook Groups than for Facebook News Feed.\n\nFrequency of use for news\nFacebook News Feed\nFacebook Group\nEvery day\n23%\n28%\nWeekly or more\n55%\n51%\nA few times a month or more\n78%\n67%\nSeparately, we asked people how satisfied they are with various local news sources, including some Facebook Groups. The Facebook Groups ranked higher in satisfaction than any other news source. For example the Group named \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d rated highly, with 25% saying they \u201clove it and use it all the time\u201d and a total of 60% saying they at least \u201cfind it useful and use it sometimes.\u201d Another 18% \u201cdon\u2019t love it, but \u201cuse it when I have to.\u201d Only 10% avoid it and 12% never heard of or used it. The Group named \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton\u201d was more polarizing: 28% \u201clove it\u201d and 16% \u201cdislike\u201d it. Nonetheless, 50% of respondents find it useful sometimes and 65% at least use it when they have to. Focus group participants also reported accessing local news via Facebook, as well as from family/friends and from local television news, in particular on News 12 New Jersey.\n\nOther social networks are used by a smaller number of respondents, suggesting either that the Journal should be cautious about devoting too many scarce resources to other platforms or that the survey and focus groups did not reach community members who use these for local news and information.\n\nSocial network\nPercent using daily\nPercent using 1-2 times a week or more\nInstagram\n19%\n43%\nTwitter\n12%\n37%\nTikTok\n14%\n31%\n\nMeanwhile, about 45% of survey respondents use Trenton Journal social media accounts at least weekly, and 68% visit at least a few times a month. The other newspapers we asked about \u2014 The Trentonian, Trenton Daily, and The Times of Trenton \u2014 ranked lower in satisfaction; these may be secondary sources for some of the Journal\u2019s readers.\nWe also asked survey respondents to name any sources that they \u201ctrust the most for useful, reliable local news and information.\u201d There were a few individual responses to that question that might suggest nontraditional sources with whom the Journal may want to build relationships:\nLuz Esperanza y Vida organization.\nEast Trenton committee.\nTrenton Waves podcast.\nStreet ministries.\nThe Old Mill Hill Society.\n\nWhat people think of Trenton Journal\n\nRespondents generally enjoy Trenton Journal\u2019s content on social media: 21% \u201clove\u201d Trenton Journal social media and use it all the time. Another 41% (the most common answer) say Trenton Journal\u2019s social media is \u201cuseful and use it sometimes.\u201d Only 12% dislike its social accounts, and 12% haven\u2019t heard of them yet. Opinions were stronger among residents of the South Ward. They have a more favorable opinion of Trent Journal\u2019s social media accounts (32% \u201clove it\u201d, another 45% say \u201cuseful sometimes\u201d), and they rated Trenton Journal\u2019s social media accounts as more satisfying than any other local news source. \n\nTrenton Journal\u2019s website and emails were a bit less popular than their social media; still, a majority do find them useful. The website or emails are used by 47% at least weekly and at least 61% visit at least a few times a month. These somewhat contradictory findings should be explored in follow-up conversations with community members or further research.\n\nReader opinion\nTrenton Journal\u2019s \nsocial media accounts\nTrenton Journal\u2019s\n website and emails\n\u201cLove it, use it all the time\u201d\n21%\n19%\n\u201cI find it useful and use it sometimes\u201d\n41%\n39%\n\u201cI dislike it and avoid using it\u201d\n12%\n18%\nNever heard or it or used it\n12%\n9%\n\nWe asked the people familiar with Trenton Journal how well it does certain things. At least 60% of people think it does these things at least \u201cfairly well\u201d:\nIs fair to all sides.\nIs neutral and doesn't take positions on issues.\nActs as a watchdog of powerful institutions and people.\nMakes the news entertaining.\nProvides diverse points of view.\nMakes it easier to find important civic information.\nHelps people understand communities unlike their own.\nVerifies and gets the facts right.\n\nSlightly fewer people, about 55%, think it does these things at least fairly well:\nProvides forums for community discussions,\nReports on possible solutions to problems in society,\n\nAt the same time, a sizeable minority (about 40% of people) thought the Trenton Journal did those things poorly, so there is room to improve. \n\nAs part of the research design, we devised several recommendations for each publisher based on analysis of the data from the survey and focus groups. The recommendations we presented to the Trenton Journal are below, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\n\nRecommendations given to the Trenton Journal\n\nCreate a dedicated section for posting the dates and times of upcoming municipal meetings, similar to your events page; publicize it via your newsletter and social media.\nGo one step further and cover municipal meetings regularly, even if it\u2019s simply by providing a transcript.\nConsider adding a section on your website that lists all city and state departments, the services they provide, and their contact information.\nConsider offering different sub-pages for each ward, that can be tailored to the differing concerns and interest in each.\nEngage to a greater extent on Facebook, and be present on Facebook groups that are relevant in Trenton, especially \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d and \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton.\u201d\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, Trenton Journal decided to make the following changes:\n\nIncrease coverage of municipal meetings, the education system, and crime and safety.\n\nCreate a tab on the website\u2019s resource page to house publicly available data about the city.\n\nCreate an online directory of public officials and other power-holders in the city; increase coverage of them through profiles and interviews.\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them how often they visited Trenton Journal\u2019s website, how they felt about each of these changes, and for any other open-ended feedback they might provide. For each of the changes, we asked whether they agreed or disagreed with this change, and if they disagreed, what they\u2019d like to see done instead. Again the sample was disappointingly small (N=9), but generally positive.\n\nFour of the nine reported visiting the website daily, while three said they visit a few times a week and one said rarely. Perhaps not surprisingly (since the changes were based on community feedback), there was overwhelming agreement with the changes that Trenton Journal is making. However when there was disagreement there was valuable feedback, such as the suggestion to focus on neighborhoods rather than the education system, or to provide data about the percentage of rentals to ownership and information about rental building ownership as part of the publicly available data. One open-ended response stated, \u201cI love the idea of covering municipal government and the people that are associated with it.\u201d"}, {"Prompt Length": 3397, "Output Length": 48, "prompt": "read this Sitcome\n\nDefining the Genre\nSo, what is a situational comedy? As the sitcom clich\u00e9 goes, Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u2018sitcom\u2019 as:\n\u2018a radio or television comedy series that involves a continuing cast of characters in a succession of episodes\u2019\u00a0\nSo a sitcom is simply a comedy in a situation. Frequently, this incorporates an ensemble cast of characters, who rarely change and rarely develop. The Simpsons is a sitcom which best exemplifies this lack of change as even after 30 years, the central characters are still the same age, in the same house, in the same town and even in the same clothes.\nThe situation is the place to start when writing a sitcom. The location and the cast of characters is vital to fuelling the comedy.\nSo, the \u2018precinct\u2019 or primary setting. This will be the starting point for the controlling idea of the show. When it comes to precincts there are three typical types of locations in which a sitcom can be situated.\n\\* The workplace\n\\* A home\n\\* A combination of the two\n\u00a0\n1. Workplace\nBrooklyn Nine Nine uses a literal precinct in the form of the 99th Police Precinct. This is classed as a workplace situation comedy and features police officers in their various roles.\nOther examples of workplace sitcoms include the TV studio in 30 Rock, the bars in It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Cheers, the basement filled with nerds in The IT Crowd, the various political buildings and offices in Veep and The Thick of it and\u00a0the offices in The Office and\u00a0Parks and Recreation.\nThe concept of the workplace could also be less literal and include schools, universities and colleges, as in Bad Education and\u00a0Community.\u00a0The casts are therefore work colleagues or a work \u2018family\u2019.\nTo create an example, a sitcom could be set in a pizzeria, which is a place of work that would allow for a central cast of pizza chefs, owners, and waiters. But it could also feature recurring characters such as customers and delivery drivers.\n\nBest Cold Opens | Parks and Recreation\n\n[![Best Cold Opens | Parks and Recreation](https://industrialscripts.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Feey-wOyTOJs%2F0.jpg)  \nWatch this video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/eey-wOyTOJs)\n2. Home\nThe home precinct is demonstrated in the aforementioned eternal sitcom The Simpsons, and in a number of other shows based around where people live.\nThese types of sitcoms include Friends, New Girl, Seinfeld,\u00a0Modern Family,\u00a0What We Do In The Shadows and Spaced.\nThe primary location of each of these shows is a place where people live. Therefore, the casts consist of biological families or makeshift families formed of roommates or friends.\n\n3. Multiple Precincts\nThe precinct is not always the only location and almost all shows include a number of bases for the characters to interact in, both in private and public.\n\\* Frasier includes the radio station and Frasier\u2019s apartment as the two main bases but also frequently features a coffee shop.\n\\* Friends also centres around two neighbouring apartments and a coffee shop.\n\\* The school is the meeting place of the main characters in The Inbetweeners,\u00a0but the show itself rarely centres within the school. Each episode focuses more on the characters being put into a new situation such as a theme park trip, night out or work experience.\nIt is rare that a sitcom only centres on one place. But it is vital for your own sitcom writing experience that the characters have a location where they can all meet. There, they can link up to go on a variety of antics.\nHowever, a precinct doesn\u2019t make it a sitcom. So far, all we have is a part of the situation. Unless you have comedic characters you\u2019ve just written something more akin to a soap opera.\n\u00a0\nFunny People\nA sitcom will not succeed unless it has characters who are funny. Funny can\u2019t be the characters primary defintion though. The comedy has to come from somewhere intrinsically tied to who that character is.\nWhen writing comedic characters, Judd Apatow often starts by reading self-help books, which allow him to think psychologically about his characters and build them from flaws and insecurities. This is a good example of how even comedic characters need depth.\n\u00a0\nComedic Conflict\nA basis of contradictory personalities and conflict is integral to every sitcom and to comedy in general. It is the first thing you should be considering when creating your characters in your sitcom.\nTo continue the earlier pizzeria example, it is important to create a makeshift family that all contradict each other. This may mean ensuring that one pizza chef is an Italian pizza purist, while another is an advocate of hot dog stuffed crusts, for example.\n\n\u00a0\nDifferent Forms of Sitcoms\nAnother important consideration to take into account when writing a sitcom is what form it will take. This will determine how the script will be written. Forms of sitcom include:\nSingle-Camera\n\\* These are the simplest to write and follow dramatic writing conventions, as seen in Atlanta, New Girl, Gavin and Stacey.\n\\* Many shows use the single-camera form as an opportunity to create filmic episodes, giving the writer more scope to incorporate homages to other films and genres as seen in Community and Spaced.\n\\* The misleadingly named single-camera form usually uses more than one camera, but is shot without an audience.\nMulti-Camera\n\\* These are often studio shows, shot in front of a live audience.\n\\* A consideration when writing is to leave spaces between jokes to allow for audience laughter.\n\\* Examples include: Friends, Frasier, The Big Bang Theory, The IT Crowd.\nAnimated\n\\* Similarly to single-camera, the animated sitcom allows for more creativity. For example, the use of surrealist jokes. After all, anything that can be created can be drawn.\n\\* Examples include: The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, Family Guy, BoJack Horseman.\nComedic Genres\nThere are many different comedic genres within comedy. Sitcoms often use a combination of styles and genres within them.\nWatching and studying shows like those listed below will give you a good understanding of the potential breadth of genre within the crafting of a sitcom:\n\\* Mockumentary \u2013 eg. The Office,\u00a0Parks and Recreation, Modern Family, What We Do In The Shadows\n\\* Wit and Wordplay \u2013 eg. Frasier, Seinfeld,\u00a0How I Met Your Mother\n\\* Slapstick and Farce \u2013 eg. Fawlty Towers, Friday Night Dinner,\u00a0Arrested Development\n\\* Deadpan \u2013 eg. Flight of The Conchords\n\\* Spoof and Homage \u2013 eg.\u00a0Community, The Simpsons, Spaced\n\\* Satire \u2013 eg. The Thick of It, Veep, W1A, Avenue 5\n\\* Surreal \u2013 eg. BoJack Horseman,\u00a0Family Guy, The Mighty Boosh\n\\* Dark Comedy \u2013 eg. Black Books, It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\n\\* Blue Comedy \u2013 eg. The Inbetweeners,\u00a0Catastrophe\n\\* Cringe \u2013 eg. The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm\nIt\u2019s important always to link the genre of your sitcom to your core values and intensions. These different comedic genres can have different functions. When misapplied or inappropriate their strength can feel undermined.\n\\* For example, The Office is about the minutiae of office life and the ego of the central character desperately trying to impress the omnipresent documentary crew. So a mockumentary format is perfect for this idea.\n\\* Whilst Spaced is about\u00a0a group of aimless young adults saturated in popular culture. So to have it spoof and homage other films and genres makes perfect sense.\n\u00a0\nThe Sitcom Story Structure\nSitcom story structure can be viewed similarly to the scriptwriting of any television show or film,\u00a0 just condensed to a 22-30 minute script. When writing a sitcom the three-act structure can be applied as with every other genre of film or TV. This isn\u2019t a strict rule but a helpful guide to follow.\nFriends Season 1 Episode 5: The One with the East German Laundry Detergent demonstrates sitcom story structure well as it has three separate plots that all rapidly go through the three-act structure. It demonstrates how sitcoms both use the traditional film three-act structure but also have unique elements to their form as well.\n\u00a0\nFirst Act:\nThe friends are all gathered in the coffee shop. During the first act, they split up into pairs, creating three separate plots with two main characters in each.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel agree to meet and do laundry. Ross is nervous when he convinces himself that it is a date and wants it to go well. Rachel wants to do her own laundry to feel independent.\nB Plot: Chandler wants to break up with his girlfriend, Janice. Phoebe wants to break up with her boyfriend, Tony.\nC Plot: Joey wants to take his ex-girlfriend, Angela, on a date. So, he convinces Angela to go on a double date. Angela and her new boyfriend will go on a double date with Joey and Monica. However, Joey tells Monica that Bob is actually Angela\u2019s brother, so Monica thinks she\u2019s being set up with Bob.\nSecond Act:\nAll three subplots go through mild, comedic obstacles to achieve their goals, which were established in the first act.\nA Plot: Ross and Rachel go to the laundrette. Ross defends Rachel\u2019s washing machine from being taken by a \u2018horrible woman\u2019. Ross proceeds to teach her to do laundry. Rachel\u2019s laundry doesn\u2019t go well and everything turns pink.\nB Plot: Phoebe easily breaks up with her boyfriend while Chandler is unable to break up with Janice. Chandler breaks the news to Janice and she reacts negatively.\nC Plot: Joey continues to conceal the motives behind the double date. He plants the seeds for Bob to break up with Angela by highlighting Angela\u2019s unappealing traits while he acts as a wingman for Monica. Monica and Angela go to the bathroom together and discuss Bob.\n\nThird Act:\nA Plot: Rachel stands up to the horrible woman proving her independence and Ross and Rachel briefly kiss. Ross then bumps his head on a washing machine door. During the End Tag, Rachel is icing Ross\u2019 head.\nB Plot: Phoebe intervenes in Chandler\u2019s break up and Janice leaves happily. During the End Tag, Chandler runs through the streets celebrating his newfound freedom.\nC Plot: Joey confesses to Monica that Bob and Angela aren\u2019t siblings and the two agree to break the couple up. During the End Tag, Joey and Monica return from their date, overjoyed at having \u201cripped that couple apart\u201d.\nEveryone is basically in the same position as they were in when the episode started. They have gone through minor changes but are ultimately all still sat in the coffee shop together. The story has gone in a circle.\n\u00a0\nOther Examples and Structures\nDan Harmon, creator of Community\u00a0and\u00a0Rick and Morty handily adapted the 3-act structure into a story circle. The situation is allowed to change over the course of the episode but ultimately the characters are unchanged and in relatively the same position.\nHarmon\u2019s story circle is partially based on the \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d and blueprints a successful structure for a sitcom.\n\n1. A character is in their comfort zone or regular situation (the precinct),\n2. But they want or need something else,\n3. They go into an unfamiliar situation or cross a threshold,\n4. The character adapts to the situation while facing trials and obstacles,\n5. Finding what they wanted, whether they like it or not,\n6. But the new situation \u201ckicks their ass\u201d and forces them to pay the price,\n7. Then they return to their familiar situation (the precinct),\n8. The events of the episode have changed them. In sitcom, this is rarely drastic.\nSitcoms are only 22-30 minutes long and thus the story structure is compressed and the story is almost on fast forward.\n\u00a0\nWrite What You Know \u2013 But Make it Funny\nOne of the most common pieces of advice that people seem to tell you when writing is to write what you know. This is also true in sitcom, but as always, it doesn\u2019t mean you can only write about yourself.\nTake funny situations that happen to you and put your characters in the same situation, adapt the story of your life. If you meet someone that makes you laugh \u2013 write a similar character to them in to your medieval sitcom.\n\u00a0\nHow to Actually Write A Sitcom Script\nIn terms of how to write a screenplay, the writing process of a sitcom script is similar to any other script. However, there are a few ways in which a sitcom script may vary. Consider the following elements of a sitcom script:\n\\* The Cold Open \u2013 This is an opportunity to include a joke which doesn\u2019t play into the rest of the episode as a comedic hook to draw in a new audience.\n\\* The End Tag \u2013 Very similar to the cold open but at the end of the episode. Often it is a payoff to a small set-up from earlier in the episode. But it can also be an entirely original joke involving one or two characters (Troy and Abed often serve this purpose in Community).\n\\* Use of Flashbacks/Cutaways \u2013\u00a0Family Guy, 30 Rock and most mockumentaries frequently use flashbacks and cutaways for quick punchlines and gags.\n\\* Callbacks and Running Jokes \u2013\u00a0Arrested Development\u00a0is a particularly excellent series for having jokes that pop up in different iterations throughout the series. It\u2019s a kind of language that show itself will create and repeatedly use throughout.\n\\* Fast Paced Scenes \u2013 Scenes in sitcoms are rarely long, 1-2 pages per scene or set-up is fairly standard as it keeps the pace moving quickly and you can move on to the next joke or comedic setup quickly.\n\u00a0\nRe-Draft to Make It Funnier\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your script, workshop it with people. Read it through aloud and see which bits are funny and which bits need work. Then, re-write, re-read, re-workshop your script.\nThis process will have developed it into something that, at the very least, you and your workshop find funny. If it makes you laugh, chances are it\u2019ll make a few other people laugh.\nPerhaps more than most genres, comedy is hard to get right without finding out if it works with an audience. This is even more relevant in a sitcom. So sharing your work with others and seeing how it plays to a room (however big or small that room may be) is a vital step in the process.\n\u00a0\nAnd Finally\u2026 Don\u2019t forget to Defy Genre\nWhen writing a sitcom, remember to innovate and create a genre hybrid. Combining elements of different genres and forms can create interesting and exciting new ideas.\n\\* What We Do In The Shadows, for example, combines a house-share, a mockumentary and a world in which supernatural creatures exist.\n\\* Peep Show\u00a0takes a flat share and gives the main characters internal monologues.\n\\* Community\u00a0takes a number of different genres and uses them throughout the series to create different innovative episodes within the sitcom genre.\nInnovation makes the sitcom and your script stand out. This guide has given you the outline of what a sitcom is, how it works and how to write one.\nIt\u2019s also important to know that as with everything else, these rules can and sometimes should be broken. If you want to write a sitcom about a pizzeria then do it. If you want to stray further from the norms and set this pizzeria in a medieval kingdom, that is your prerogative.\nInnovation is important and so is enjoying what you\u2019re writing. So write what you know, and write what you like. If your enthusiasm for the idea jumps off the page, then it will be of interest to like-minded people.\nSitcoms are there to make us laugh, comfort us and re-unite us every night with characters we\u2019ve grown to know. It\u2019s vital that in a genre with these intentions, these elements are baked into to the writing."}, {"Prompt Length": 4275, "Output Length": 68, "prompt": "Describe as reporting live a current event in 3 lines, what is happening right now using the following tweets, with a focus on the term \"di maria\"\n\nsourceText Time\nDi Maria scores the second goal for Argentina. 15:36:48.0000000\nArgentinaaaaaaaaaaa ????

It wakes up the gluteal muscles (the big muscles in your buttocks). It reinforces spinal stabilization. It builds endurance and strength in the muscles on the front and back of the core. And it is the precursor to doing a proper squat, which comes later in the book. \nDo the bridge as follows:\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Bend your knees and put your feet in a flexed position so that your heels are on the ground and the balls of your feet and toes are off of the ground as pictured.\nStep 4: Squeeze your buttocks together as if you were trying to pinch a coin between them.\n\nStep 5: Here\u2019s the tricky part: Using the glutes, lift your hips/torso off of the ground without moving your lower back. You should not articulate the spine and roll up \u201cone vertebra at a time.\u201d You want to do the opposite of that. You want to lift the torso in one solid piece while maintaining your neutral spine. No movement should take place in the lower back.\nStep 6: Hold for five to ten seconds (remember these are suggestions. Hold to your tolerance in the beginning, with ten seconds being your goal). You should feel the muscles in both sides of your buttocks working relatively equally.\nStep 7: Lower your back down to the starting position without losing your neutral spine. Again, do not articulate the spine on the way down. In other words, do not roll the spine down onto the floor one vertebra at a time.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 2 through 7, and do five to ten reps, with ten being your long-term goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Hamstring cramping. If your hamstrings cramp (the muscles that run down the underside of your thighs), gently push your feet into the floor away from you before you lift your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Knee pain. If one or both of your knees hurt, lightly press your knees outward before lifting your hips/torso off the ground.\n\u2022 Unable to maintain neutral spine. Start by trying to lift your hips/torso only an inch off the ground. Slowly progress to a full bridge over the next few weeks.\n\u2022 Unable to feel glutes working. Go to Chapter 13. Then come back and start with the following regression.\n\u2022 If your back hurts with this exercise, proceed to the Buttock Squeezes regression on the next page. Try these for a few days or weeks and then come back and try the bridge again, making sure to follow instructions meticulously. If your back still hurts, you may have a spinal condition like severe stenosis that makes you sensitive to extension in the spine. If this is the case, this exercise might not be for you.\nCommon Mistakes\nThe most common mistake for back patients with the bridge exercise is that they use their hamstrings instead of their glutes to bring the hips up into position. If your hamstrings are cramping, then you aren\u2019t using your glutes enough. Go to Chapter 13 and practice \u201cwaking up your glutes,\u201d and then come back to this exercise and try it again.\nREGRESSION\nButtock Squeezes\nIf you don\u2019t have the strength or control yet to perform a single bridge exercise properly for any amount of time, start with buttock squeezes.\n1. Lie on your back, with arms at your side, knees bent, feet hip-width apart.\n2. Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your buttocks together as if trying to squeeze a coin between them.\n4. Hold for ten seconds.\n5. Do ten reps.\nPROGRESSION\nOne-Leg Bridge\nOnce you have mastered the bridge and are able to do it with relative ease and with no discomfort in the back, you may want to progress to the one-leg bridge. You do not have to progress to this exercise. Depending on your spinal condition and your fitness level, you may not need to progress this far. This progression is for those who are reasonably fit and plan to be very active in sports, exercise, or outdoor activities.\n1. Follow all rules for the bridge.\n2. Once your hips and torso are off the ground, give extra care to make sure your core is braced as firmly as possible.\n\n3. Slowly extend one leg at the knee without letting the hips/torso drop on that side. You will feel the glutes of the other stabilizing leg kick in as you extend the leg.\n4. Hold five to ten seconds.\n5. Slowly bring the extended leg back to the bent-knee starting position. (Do not lower your hips/torso while doing this. Maintain the bridge position with a neutral spine until your foot is back on the floor.)\n6. Slowly lower your hips/torso back to the starting position on the floor without articulating the spine.\n7. On the other side, repeat Steps 1 through 6, making sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your core in place before extending the leg at the knee.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 When you go to one leg, it is easy to \u201ccock\u201d your hips to one side, to make it easier. Don\u2019t do that. Keep your thighs parallel during the whole exercise. If you can\u2019t, you aren\u2019t strong enough yet for this exercise.\n\u2022 Regarding extending the leg as you come up/bending the leg down as you go down: Make sure to come up into a full bridge and lock your spine before you try to extend the leg. Conversely, make sure you bring the leg all the way back in before coming down to the starting position.\n\u2022 Do not bring the thigh of the extended leg up. Make sure your thighs remain parallel so that you have to use the gluteal muscles to keep the pelvis stable.\nEXERCISE 3\nCrunch and Plank\nWe discuss these two exercises together because they both do a lot of the same things, and some of you will not get to the plank and that\u2019s okay. The plank will take you a bit further toward returning to strenuous activities, but the crunch is enough to get you out of pain. The purpose of the crunch and the plank is to build endurance and strength in the abdominal wall (crunch and plank) and glutes and lats (plank) and to increase spinal stability. Very few back pain sufferers are strong enough to do a plank properly in the beginning and must do crunches for a while before attempting the plank.\nCrunch\nFirst of all, this exercise is not a sit-up. Sit-ups (the traditional \u201cArmy sit-up,\u201d where you pull yourself into a full sitting position) have been proven to be very risky to the spine. They run dangerous loads through the lumbar discs. If you wanted to develop a way to herniate a disc in a lab, a sit-up would be a good candidate for it. Crunches, unlike full sit-ups, do not allow movement in the lumbar spine. Your lumbar spine stays in neutral throughout.\nStep 1: Lie on your back, with your arms at your side, legs hip-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n\nStep 3: Place your hands behind your head, if possible. If you can\u2019t, because of shoulder discomfort, that\u2019s okay. Find a comfortable position for your hands.\nStep 4: Gently draw your chin in toward your neck, giving yourself a \u201cdouble chin.\u201d Hold this position throughout the exercise.\nStep 5: Slowly and carefully raise your shoulder blades and head toward the ceiling an inch or two, giving a moderate squeeze in the abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your lower back. Keep a neutral spine; this will be harder than you think. Only bring your shoulders off the floor as far as you can without moving your lower back. The max distance, when you\u2019re great at it, would be no more than, say, four inches.\n\nStep 6: Hold five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nStep 7: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your lower back.\nStep 8: Repeat Steps 1 through 7, for five to ten reps, with ten being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u201cMy neck hurts.\u201d First, you shouldn\u2019t be pulling your head with your arms. Your arms/hands are there only to provide a little support to your head and neck. Make sure that you pull your chin in toward your neck before initiating the exercise. This will engage your deep neck flexors that support the spine. If this does not relieve neck pain, move to the Regression.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 The most common mistake is flattening or (worse) rounding the back. It is crucial that you not make this mistake. Doing crunches while continually rounding or flattening the back will promote spinal instability, the opposite of our goal. Details matter!\n\u2022 Chin jutting. If your chin is poking out toward the ceiling with each rep, you are not stabilizing your cervical spine and your neck extensors are taking over. Make sure to draw the chin in toward your neck before each rep.\nREGRESSION\nAbdominal Contractions\nDo this exercise until you build up enough abdominal strength to accomplish the crunch.\n1. Start in the same position as for the bridge.\n2. Place one hand behind your lower back and one hand inside your front hipbone beside your navel.\n3. Squeeze your abdominal muscles without flattening or rounding your back. You should feel your back being still with one hand and the abs engaging with the other hand.\n4. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n5. Repeat for several reps until fatigue sets in.\nPROGRESSION\nPlank\nOnce you have mastered the crunch and are able to do crunches with relative ease and without pain or movement in the lower back, try the plank. This is a great exercise to build increased core stability, endurance, and strength. Some of you (especially those with severe stenosis) may never be able to do a plank. That\u2019s okay. Give the plank a try, and if it doesn\u2019t work for you, stay with crunches. If you do go on to the plank, follow the directions closely; most people do this exercise incorrectly.\n\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent and palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders.\n5. Lift your knees off of the floor so you are now on your toes and forearms.\n6. \u201cTraction\u201d your forearms into the floor. In other words, press them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and down toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n\n7. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n8. Slowly put your knees back down first. Do not let your hips/pelvis go to the floor first; this would put your back into extension and may cause pain.\n9. Repeat Steps 1 through 8, for two to five reps, with five being the goal.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my lower back.\u201d Some people just can\u2019t do a plank. Even if they do it the right way, it still aggravates their back. If you can\u2019t do a plank, drop it and stick with crunches. But first, be sure that you can\u2019t do it. For example, if your lower back is hurting, try sticking your buttocks in the air a little more. It could be that your hips are sagging toward the floor, putting your back into extension. Also, make sure the core is fully engaged before moving from knees to toes. Lastly, make sure you are squeezing your buttocks, which will support the lower back. If none of that works, forget it; stick with crunches.\n\u2022 \u201cThis hurts my shoulders.\u201d Make sure you are tractioning your forearms down into the floor and back toward your toes. This engages the supportive muscles of the rotator cuff. If this doesn\u2019t help, try the regression that follows.\nCommon Mistakes\n\u2022 Feet and legs are not together, which makes gluteal engagement more difficult.\n\u2022 Back is up but the hips are dropping toward the floor. This will cause back pain in people with conditions such as stenosis or facet syndrome.\n\u2022 You\u2019re forgetting to pull shoulders back and forearms into the floor with chin jutting. This will cause an increase in pressure in the shoulders and/or neck, resulting in shoulder and neck pain.\nREGRESSION\nPlank on Knees\nIf you aren\u2019t quite ready for plank but think crunch is just too easy, try this one.\n1. Lie facedown with your forehead on the floor and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, elbows bent, palms down.\n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in.\n3. Squeeze your glutes together and squeeze your feet together.\n4. Come up onto your forearms and knees with your elbows below your shoulders (see illustration, for the plank).\n5. Traction your forearms into the floor, pulling them into the floor and back toward your feet at the same time. Your forearms shouldn\u2019t move; you are just creating a pulling force into the floor and back toward your feet. This should make you feel more contraction in your lats and lower abdominal muscles.\n6. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\nEXERCISE 4\nDynamic Hamstring Stretch\nCAUTION\nThis exercise may irritate symptoms of people with active radiculopathy, such as severe leg/foot pain, and numbness or tingling in the legs or feet. If you have these symptoms, start with caution; you may not be able to do this exercise. If this exercise exacerbates your leg or back symptoms, skip it for now and come back to it when the symptoms are resolved.\nThe dynamic hamstring stretch helps to improve mobility in the hips and also helps to reinforce and strengthen your ability to maintain a neutral spine while moving the legs. It also builds endurance and strength in the core.\nStep 1: Lie on your back and find neutral spine.\nStep 2: Brace the core to lock in neutral spine.\n\nStep 3: Bend one leg at the knee with your foot flat on floor. Straighten out the other leg onto the floor, with foot flexed (toes pointed up).\nStep 4: Carefully raise the straight leg without losing your neutral spine; in other words, make sure your lower back isn\u2019t flattening into the floor as your leg comes up. To check, put one of your hands underneath your lower back and feel for movement. Raise the leg only as high as you can without flattening your back into the floor. \nStep 5: Do ten to twenty repetitions on each leg. Do as many as needed to feel that you have mildly stretched your hamstrings and worked your core.\nCommon Mistake\nFlattening the back into the floor as you bring the leg up. Remember, one of the most important points of these exercises is to teach you neutral spine/spinal stability. You do not want to accomplish an increase of movement speed at the expense of spinal stabilization. Bring up your leg only as high as you can without flattening your back or bending your knee. Increasing hamstring flexibility will come with time.\nEXERCISE 5\nSide Plank\nThe side plank works the muscles on the lateral (side) parts of the core, such as the obliques, gluteus medius, and quadratus lumborum. This exercise is a very important one. I mention this because almost everyone hates doing it. But don\u2019t give up: Your back depends on it. Many readers will not be able to do this exercise at first because their core is weak. Don\u2019t worry. There are regressions (easier exercises) for those of you who can\u2019t do this one yet.\nStep 1: Start by lying on your side, propped up on your forearm, with your elbow under your shoulder. Relax the other arm for now. Pull your lower arm shoulder blade inward toward your spine and downward toward your buttocks, engaging the lat muscles.\nStep 2: Drop your hips back a bit so that they sit behind your feet and shoulders."}, {"Prompt Length": 3573, "Output Length": 76, "prompt": "Describe as reporting live a current event in 3 lines, what is happening right now using the following tweets :\n\nsourceText Time\nSublime team goal from Argentina that #FIFAWorldCup #ArgentinaVsFrance 15:36:49.0000000\nTotal domination ????

Can you summarize it for me:\n\n0:00\nso i recommend posting to both airbnb\n0:02\nand vrbo regardless of what air dna says\n0:05\nwhere people are mainly listing in your\n0:06\narea if you don't what i'm talking about\n0:08\nhere here when you come and this is on\n0:09\nthe free version as well it'll show you\n0:11\nwhere hosts are listing their properties\n0:12\neither airbnb or vrp or both regardless\n0:14\nof what it says i think it's important\n0:16\nto be diversified on both platforms you\n0:18\nknow most cases most of your bookings\n0:19\nwill come from airbnb but you know again\n0:21\nit never hurts to be diversified you\n0:22\nknow reason being even if you get 10 to\n0:24\n20 of your bookings from vrbo that's\n0:26\nmoney that you're leaving on the table\n0:28\nand later in this training i'll be\n0:29\nshowing you how to automate your\n0:30\nmessaging and calendar on both platforms\n0:32\nanyway so i'll just take the few extra\n0:33\nminutes it will take to post a vrbo as\n0:35\nwell now before we jump in make sure to\n0:37\ncreate a brand new email for both\n0:38\nlistings just like we did when creating\n0:40\na separate bank account for your\n0:41\nbusiness same idea here we want to\n0:43\nseparate your personal from your\n0:45\nbusiness as much as possible to keep\n0:46\nthings clean now posting your listing is\n0:48\npretty intuitive and both platforms walk\n0:50\nyou through step by step but i'm going\n0:51\nto share a few things along the way that\n0:52\nare important to note this is just a\n0:54\nlittle tip that i picked up along the\n0:55\nway for whatever reason if you have a\n0:57\nsignificant other heck even if it's your\n0:59\nmom i would list their name here on the\n1:01\nlisting if you have a female name people\n1:02\nlike to book and it creates a layer of\n1:04\ntrust that i don't really understand but\n1:06\nonce i started putting my wife's name in\n1:08\nhere it seemed to get more booking so\n1:10\nyou know again this is one of those\n1:11\nplacebo things that i feel like is\n1:12\nworking so if it ain't broke then don't\n1:14\nfix it all right so let's go in here\n1:16\ncreate a new listing and again something\n1:17\nthat airbnb is shifting over to is\n1:20\ncreating a unique experience and so\n1:22\nwhatever you know you're going to be\n1:23\ndoing so let's say you're doing an\n1:24\napartment and then you also want to\n1:26\ndescribe what kind of place that you're\n1:28\nin so let's say we have a loft here\n1:30\nentire place and then let's say you know\n1:32\nwe want to pick your address let's say\n1:35\nit's right here let's say you can fit\n1:36\nsix people you can have four beds and\n1:39\nthey're say it's two-bedroom and then\n1:41\nyou wanna make sure you come in here and\n1:42\njust pick all of the different amenities\n1:44\nthat your place has you know especially\n1:45\nif it's an apartment then you wanna go\n1:47\nin here check all the amenities that\n1:48\nyour apartment offers and then you can\n1:50\ncome in here and just click all these on\n1:52\nagain this isn't gonna be the full\n1:53\ncomprehensive amenities that you can\n1:55\ninclude there's a lot more that you can\n1:56\nadd after you post your listing live all\n1:58\nright now this is super important and\n1:59\nthis is where your professional photos\n2:01\nwill come into play i'll use one of my\n2:02\nlistings photos to show you how i would\n2:04\nrearrange them depending on how i think\n2:06\nthey look and which photo really grabs\n2:07\nthe attention of the user the most so\n2:09\nhonestly this has done a pretty good job\n2:11\nof kind of choosing which photos to\n2:13\nchoose first anyway this one would\n2:14\ndefinitely be my feature photo just\n2:16\nbecause you know the tall you know\n2:18\ntongue and groove here on the ceiling\n2:19\nyou know it has really good contrast\n2:21\nreally pops you know we have this little\n2:23\naccent fireplace right here as well and\n2:25\nit really highlights you know that the\n2:26\nfurniture is really nice and clean and\n2:28\nit's really just a really good picture\n2:30\nand it's done really well for us this is\n2:31\nactually our first picture on our actual\n2:33\nlisting but you want to pick the best\n2:35\nfive photos that you have and you're\n2:37\ngoing to have anywhere from 30 to 50\n2:39\npictures so what i'll do here next and\n2:41\nlet's just take a look to see what we\n2:43\nhave okay so the next picture that i\n2:44\nwould like to do i'm gonna use this\n2:46\nmaster bedroom photo here it has the\n2:48\nblue borton band wall here that really\n2:50\njust pops out in pictures then i really\n2:51\nlike that to use as my second photo the\n2:53\nnext photo that i'll use here because we\n2:55\nhave the game room in this property this\n2:56\nis another good one just because you\n2:58\nknow shows that it's going to be a fun\n2:59\nenvironment if you have kids that you\n3:01\ncan have your kids go downstairs and\n3:02\nplay and hang out in the game room area\n3:04\nso i think this would be a good third\n3:06\nphoto the next photo that i'm going to\n3:07\nuse is use this you know outdoor area i\n3:10\nthink this is a really cool photo you\n3:11\nknow because people don't want to be\n3:12\nconfined in their space when they go on\n3:15\nvacation i also want to highlight that\n3:16\nthey can have this you know cool little\n3:18\noutdoor deck area where they can just\n3:19\nkind of hang out and chill and then we\n3:21\nneed one more so out of these photos i'm\n3:23\ngoing to use this one right here and\n3:24\nthen for the last photo here i'm going\n3:25\nto use this kitchen again because it\n3:27\nhighlights the tongue and groove it\n3:28\nshows that the kitchen's you know nice\n3:30\nand updated and then we have this long\n3:32\ntable here with this little breakfast\n3:33\nnook so i definitely like these five\n3:34\nphotos and what this will do it's really\n3:36\ngonna highlight your five best moments\n3:38\nin the house and that's how you wanna\n3:39\nthink of it when you choose your photos\n3:41\num this is really important so how this\n3:43\nwill look and i'll show you what it\n3:44\nlooks like on my actual listing so when\n3:46\nyou come in here it's going to have your\n3:47\nmain photo here and then it's going to\n3:49\nhave the other four photos here on the\n3:50\nright where you can you know highlight a\n3:52\nlittle bit more and then they can show\n3:53\nall photos and they can go down here so\n3:55\nat the time of this recording airbnb has\n3:56\nactually updated their algorithm and\n3:59\nwhen you go to the front page now this\n4:01\nis what it looks like so it doesn't have\n4:03\nany of the titles here it basically just\n4:04\nshows you where the airbnb is located\n4:07\nand then you can come in here and you\n4:08\ncan search by national parks cabins so\n4:10\nyou can't be unique with the listing\n4:12\ntitle anymore but that doesn't mean that\n4:13\nit's not important i'm just going to\n4:15\ncome in here and just kind of copy what\n4:16\ni've done with my one of my other\n4:17\nlistings here so you want to just make\n4:19\nit unique you know it's kind of\n4:20\nhighlight a few things because when the\n4:21\nperson actually clicks on your listing\n4:23\nthen you'll be able to see your title\n4:25\nbut when you're actually searching for\n4:26\nproperties you won't be able to see it\n4:28\njust shows you the location of where\n4:30\nit's at so you want to highlight the\n4:31\nvibe of your place so if it's unique\n4:33\nstylish you can just pick those and then\n4:35\nyour description is going to be really\n4:36\nimportant as well this is where you can\n4:38\nyou know tell a story about you know\n4:40\nwhat exactly your listing is going to do\n4:42\nand you know we have some examples that\n4:43\nyou can use on our listings that will\n4:45\nshare essentially what you want to do\n4:46\nthe format that we like to take here so\n4:48\nwe'd like to have you know a quick you\n4:50\nknow three sentence high level overview\n4:52\nof what you'll be experiencing if you\n4:53\ncome to our property and then we'd like\n4:55\nto do a bullet point list of all of the\n4:57\nthings that we offer and then we also\n4:59\ncome in here and just kind of describe\n5:00\neach uni if they want to dig a little\n5:02\nbit deeper into each part of the house\n5:03\nthey can just come in here and read all\n5:05\nthis so again you can copy this if you\n5:06\nwant and just kind of make it your own\n5:08\nright so so for here you know we don't\n5:10\nwant to worry about pricing in airbnb we\n5:12\ndo all this on price labs which i'm\n5:14\ngoing to share with you in a later\n5:14\nmodule so what you want to do is come in\n5:16\nhere and increase the pricing by at\n5:18\nleast three times what you normally\n5:19\nwould charge and the reason i do that is\n5:21\nonce you hit live your listing is going\n5:23\nto start showing up on the algorithm the\n5:25\nalgorithm actually favors people that\n5:27\njust have a brand new listing and it\n5:29\nputs it on the front page and so you\n5:31\ndon't want someone to come in here and\n5:32\nbook your listing at a really great\n5:34\ndiscount that's why 3x the price of what\n5:36\nmy normal base price would be so i can\n5:37\ncome in and update all of our software\n5:39\nautomations and tools and then super\n5:41\nimportant you want to offer this 20\n5:43\ndiscount for your first three guests and\n5:45\nwhat this will do it's gonna start\n5:47\nsnowballing get your reviews that way\n5:48\nyou can get started on a good foot and\n5:50\nreally get your bookings in right away\n5:51\nand again there's two different\n5:52\nstrategies that you can use so what i\n5:54\npersonally like to do is i like to\n5:55\nincrease the price by you know anywhere\n5:57\nfrom 15 to 20 percent of my base pricing\n6:00\nbecause you know when people see that\n6:01\nthey're getting a 20 discount\n6:02\npsychologically even if it's not really\n6:04\na discount they think they're getting a\n6:06\ngreat deal because they see the 20 off\n6:08\nyou can offset the discount by\n6:09\nincreasing your price so essentially\n6:10\nyou're netting the same i've also seen\n6:12\nother people lower the price and get\n6:14\nbookings that way just so they can start\n6:15\ngetting reviews i like to increase my\n6:17\nprice and that the same because i feel\n6:18\nlike your listing is optimized with\n6:20\ngreat photos and a great listing\n6:22\ndescription then you're gonna get\n6:23\nbookings if you're put on the front page\n6:25\nanyway so that's the way i like to look\n6:27\nat it but again that's completely up to\n6:28\nyou so then you wanna you know make sure\n6:30\nthat you come in here and you know if\n6:32\nyou have security cameras you want to\n6:33\nlist that come in here review your\n6:34\nlisting once you're ready publish your\n6:36\nlisting and then go in and unlist it\n6:38\njust because we're going to onboard a\n6:39\ncouple of software automation tools\n6:41\nfirst before we go officially live so a\n6:43\ncouple things to note for the amount of\n6:44\nguests that i allow and\n6:46\nthe rule of thumb that i like to use is\n6:48\ni like to put one person per every 100\n6:50\nsquare feet of your property and also\n6:52\ndepends on the amount of rooms that you\n6:54\nhave and also it's going to depend on\n6:55\ndifferent regulations and laws in your\n6:57\nspecific area some places no matter how\n6:59\nbig it is will only allow you know six\n7:01\nguests or eight guests you have to make\n7:03\nsure you know those regulations and laws\n7:05\ni like to use four mattresses don't use\n7:07\nblow up mattresses because those you\n7:08\nknow can pop they always deflate no\n7:10\nmatter you know how well you take care\n7:12\nof them so you can use floor mattresses\n7:14\num you can also use the pull out couches\n7:16\nit really depends on your area and i'll\n7:18\nshow you what your budget is again\n7:19\ncreating a great listing description is\n7:21\nreally important because it really sells\n7:22\nthe guest on your listing and what i\n7:24\nlike to do is i like to go on the front\n7:26\npage of my area that i'm going to be in\n7:29\nand see what the top performers are\n7:30\ndoing and kind of take inspiration here\n7:32\nand there and make it your own obviously\n7:34\ndon't just copy them verbatim but you\n7:36\nwant to see what the top performers are\n7:37\ndoing and then i know i'm going to get\n7:38\nasked this question as well we like to\n7:40\nuse a strict cancellation policy on ours\n7:42\nand then cleaning fee you want to make\n7:44\nsure that you pad yours anywhere from 15\n7:46\nto 30 percent because the guest is going\n7:47\nto be paying this anyway obviously\n7:49\nthat's going to depend on the cleaner if\n7:50\nyou find a great cleaner that charges a\n7:52\nlittle bit more than what your\n7:54\ncompetition is charging i think it's\n7:56\nworth having them just because you'll\n7:57\nhave less headaches down the line and\n7:59\nagain i always like to pad my cleaning\n8:00\ncosts just because i use that as\n8:02\nreserves for maintenance repairs you\n8:04\nknow anything else that might come up\n8:06\nand also to tip my cleaners as well and\n8:08\nthen another really important thing you\n8:09\nwant to do is you want to charge more\n8:11\nper guest after let's say you know five\n8:14\nto six guests depending on how big your\n8:16\nlisting is and i'll add anywhere from\n8:17\ntwenty to thirty dollars more per night\n8:19\nand what this is going to do this is\n8:21\ngoing to allow you to increase your\n8:22\naverage daily rate just by more guests\n8:24\ncoming in and again people are gonna lie\n8:26\nabout how many guests they're bringing\n8:27\nso you wanna enforce these rules on your\n8:29\nsecurity camera and you wanna see how\n8:30\nmany guests are actually coming in this\n8:32\nis a really easy way to increase your\n8:33\naverage daily rate just because if you\n8:35\nhave you know let's say three more\n8:37\nguests after six that's almost 100 bucks\n8:39\nextra per night that you can charge and\n8:41\nif you have a great listing if you\n8:43\nfollow everything else in this training\n8:45\nyour listing is going to be so optimized\n8:46\nthat people are going to want to book\n8:47\nyour place they're going to pay that\n8:49\npremium to stay at your place so make\n8:50\nsure that you do that so once your\n8:51\nlisting is live you can come in here and\n8:52\nadd a co-host just put that you pay them\n8:54\nzero dollars and obviously you can pay\n8:55\nthem outside of the actual listing but i\n8:57\nwouldn't pay them through airbnb so yeah\n8:59\nso this is how you set that up you can\n9:01\njust add co-hosts and you just add their\n9:03\nemail here"},

In a mediation process, a neutral, trained mediator works to help disputants come to a consensus on their own. In arbitration, a neutral, trained arbitrator serves as a judge who is responsible for resolving the dispute.\n\nMediation is appealing because it allows parties to reach a collaborative settlement, but it could end in impasse. Arbitration, on the other hand, can wrap up a dispute conclusively, but it doesn\u2019t give disputants much say in the outcome.\n\nA hybrid approach called med-arb combines the benefits of both mediation and arbitration techniques.\n\nIn this mediation and arbitration hybrid, parties first attempt to collaborate on an agreement with the help of a mediator. If the mediation ends in impasse, or if issues remain unresolved, the parties can then move on to arbitration.\n\nThe mediator can assume the role of arbitrator (if qualified) and render a binding decision quickly, or an arbitrator can take over the case after consulting with the mediator.\n\nIf you are considering med-arb (or arb-med), or if another party has recommended it to you, weigh the potential benefits and concerns carefully. Med-arb has a proven ability to get disputes resolved relatively quickly and amicably, but making a single choice between mediation and arbitration is often be sufficient to meet your needs.\n\nTo learn more about mediation, claim your FREE copy of Mediation Secrets for Better Business Negotiations: Top Techniques from Mediation Training Experts.

Best of all, these starters will hook your reader and keep their eyes on your email.\n\n1. It's not about what you can't do, but what you can do.\n\nStephen Hawking once said, \"However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the things we can't do, the obstacles that stand in our way. But that mindset limits us and prevents us from reaching our full potential.\n\nInstead, focus on what you can do and what you are capable of achieving. It may require a change in perspective or a different approach, but success is within reach.\n\n[Transition to specific strategies or tools that readers can use to overcome limitations and achieve their goals.]\n\n2. Every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nThomas Edison, one of the most inventive minds in history, is quoted as saying, \"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\"\n\nWhen we fail, it's easy to see it as a setback or a defeat. \nBut in reality, every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow. It's an opportunity to explore new possibilities and find new ways to achieve our goals.\n\nSo don't let failure hold you back, instead, embrace it as a step towards success.\n\n[Transition to how readers can learn from their failures and use them to achieve their goals.]\n\n3. Life is a journey, not a destination.\n\nAs Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"Life is a journey, not a destination.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the end goal, the destination we want to reach. But it's important to remember that the journey is just as important as the destination.\n\nLife is about the experiences, the people we meet, and the lessons we learn along the way. So don't rush through it, embrace the journey and enjoy the ride.\n\n[Transition to how readers can find joy and fulfillment in the journey towards achieving their goals, rather than just focusing on the end result.]\n\n4. It's not about being perfect, it's about being authentic.\n\nAs Maya Angelou said, \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in trying to be perfect, in trying to impress others. But in the end, it's about being true to yourself and being authentic.\n\nIt's about connecting with others and making a positive impact, not about being flawless. So don't be afraid to be yourself and let your true personality shine.\n\n[Transition to how readers can be authentic in their journey towards achieving their goals, and how that authenticity can help them connect with others and achieve success.]\n\n5. The secret to success is in small, consistent steps.\nAs Lao Tzu said, \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\"\n\nIt's easy to get overwhelmed by the enormity of our goals, but the key to success is in taking small, consistent steps towards them.\n\nIt's not about the destination, it's about the journey. So don't be afraid to start small, and remember that every step you take brings you closer to your goal.\n\n[Transition to specific, actionable steps readers can take to achieve their goals.]\n\n6. Don't let fear hold you back from pursuing your dreams.\n\nAs J.K. Rowling said, \"It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all.\"\n\nFear of failure is a natural part of the human experience, but it can also hold us back from pursuing our dreams.\n\nBut remember, failure is not the opposite of success, it's just a part of the journey. So don't let fear hold you back, take the first step towards your dream.\n\n[Transition to how readers can overcome fear and pursue their goals.]\n\n7. Embrace change and uncertainty as a part of the journey.\n\nAs Steve Jobs said, \"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.\"\n\nChange and uncertainty are a natural part of life, and they can often be uncomfortable. \nBut it's important to remember that these experiences shape us and help us grow.\n\nEmbrace change and uncertainty as a part of the journey, and trust that the dots will connect in the end.\n\n[Transition to how readers can navigate change and uncertainty in order to achieve their goals.]\n\n8. The road to success is not a straight path.\n\nAs Mark Twain said, \"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.\"\n\nThe road to success is not a straight path, it's filled with twists and turns. But the key to getting started is to break down your goals into small, manageable tasks.\n\nTake the first step and the rest will follow.\n\n[Transition to how readers can break down their goals into manageable tasks in order to achieve success.]\n\n9. Don't let setbacks define you, use them as a stepping stone.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln said, \"My great concern is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with your failure.\"\n\nSetbacks and failures are a natural part of the journey, but it's important to remember that they don't define us.\n\nUse setbacks as a stepping stone, and learn from them to become stronger and more resilient.\n\n[Transition to how readers can learn from setbacks and use them to achieve their goals.]\n\n10. Believe in yourself and your ability to achieve your goals.\n\nAs Helen Keller said, \"Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.\"\n\nBelief in yourself and your ability to achieve your goals is the foundation of success.\n\nDon't let doubt and uncertainty hold you back, believe in yourself and your abilities.\n\n[Transition to how readers can build self-confidence and belief in order to achieve their goals.]\n\n11. Stop living in the past\u2026\nAs the famous philosopher, Socrates said, \u201cThe past is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is a gift. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the present.\u201d\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the past and let it define us, but we must remember that the past is gone and we cannot change it.\n\nThe same applies to the future, we can't predict it, we can only plan for it.\n\nSo stop living in the past and start living in the present. Make the most of the present moment, and use it to work towards your goals.\n\n[Transition to how readers can focus on the present and use it to achieve their goals.]\n\n12. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey\u2026\n\nAs Confucius said, \u201cIt does not matter how tall the mountain is, what matters is the journey to the top.\u201d\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the destination and overlook the journey, but the journey is just as important as the destination.\n\nIt's about the experiences, the people we meet, and the lessons we learn along the way. So don't rush through it, embrace the journey and enjoy the ride.\n\n[Transition to how readers can find joy and fulfillment in the journey towards achieving their goals, rather than just focusing on the end result.]\n\n13. The power of persistence\u2026\n\nAs Thomas Edison said, \u201cI have not failed. I\u2019ve just found 10,000 ways that won\u2019t work.\u201d\nPersistence is the key to success. It's easy to give up when things get tough, but those who persist and keep pushing forward are the ones who achieve their goals.\n\nAs Thomas Edison's quote illustrates, it's not about never failing, it's about not giving up and continuing to try new things.\n\n[Transition to how readers can develop persistence in order to achieve their goals.]\n\n14. Don't be afraid to fail\u2026\nAs Michael Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I\u2019ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times \nI\u2019ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I\u2019ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.\u201d\n\nFailure is a natural part of the journey towards success, and it's important to remember that it's not about never failing, it's about learning from our failures and using them to grow and improve.\n\nDon't be afraid to fail, embrace it as a part of the journey.\n\n[Transition to how readers can learn from their failures and use them to achieve their goals.]\n\n15.

However, many current FNIs are highly invasive, not feasible in humans, or can only record from, at most, one region of the brain. My research focuses on nano functional neural interfaces (nFNIs) to solve the stated problems. My penultimate goal is to design and safely implement a system that allows for high-resolution, bidirectional communication with the nervous system while being minimally invasive. I\u2019ve been enthralled with creating this system since I was in elementary school. It is a project that will need many interdisciplinary technological advances to achieve, but I believe that such a system would have many extraordinary impacts on both research and society. \n While I am specifically interested in researching nFNIs, I wanted to ensure that I had a wide range of research experience in neuroscience to better myself as a researcher. I had the honor of taking part in the 2020 summer undergraduate research program in Computational Neuroscience hosted by Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Due to the coronavirus, the internship was converted to an online format, which required me to work mostly independently. I worked in Dr. Aaron Batista\u2019s lab under the guidance of his graduate student Erinn Grigsby where another student and I studied \u201cDecoder Performance Classified as a Function of Neurons.\u201d \nIn this study, we investigated the impact of neuron dropping on decoder performance. By utilizing my skills in Matlab, we created three different Kalman filters and linear regression decoders. Each decoder contained different position, velocity, and velocity-position decoders to test, which was the most robust to neuron dropping. Despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus, we virtually presented our work at the Center of the Neural Basis of Cognition. Getting the chance to work in Dr. Batista\u2019s lab was by far the most rewarding experience in my professional career. The experience enriched my ability to decipher papers to find pertinent information. It strengthened my ability to pose a question and find an objective method to answer it. Most importantly, I gained an in-depth knowledge of how brain-computer interface decoders operate and first-hand experience developing and designing them. On top of my other coursework and projects, I am continuing my research into brain-computer interface decoders with my partner, explicitly investigating how modulation depth and preferred direction factor into decoder performance as neurons are dropped. We hope to see if specific neurons are essential for decoding a particular action than other neurons. \nAs part of my senior thesis at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am a part of a team, under the guidance of Dr. Dirk Albrecht, investigating the dosing of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease, dystonia, essential tremor, and epilepsy. Our primary goal is to find a method of optimizing the procedure of finding the correct dosage of frequency, pulse width, and voltage for each unique individual. We aim to conduct this study utilizing C. elegans as a model system because of the animal\u2019s completed connectome. Knowing the connectome may help see the underlying mechanisms that effectively allow DBS to treat the previously stated diseases. We hope that by identifying the underlying mechanisms of DBS, the treatment might be optimized.\nUsing what I\u2019ve learned from my previous research experiences, I am currently conducting a formal independent study into neural nanotransducers. One of the most considerable problems with non-invasive stimulation and imaging of neurons is that signals are dispersed or attenuated as they pass through the skull and tissue matter. Typically, the trade-off for having a stable signal deeper into the brain is by being more invasive. However, in this study, I hypothesize that nFNIs can be used as a relay system to send and receive external devices\u2019 signals. The hypothesis is based on the biomimicry of neurons themselves. In the example of an \u201cimaging\u201d nFNI, it would receive the information of a neuron firing and transduce the signal. A nearby relay nFNI would then relay that signal until it reached the skull where the signal could be read. The process would function conversely for signals sent to a specific neuron. \nMy current theory is nanowires composed of magnetic nanoparticles bound together by a protein chain could act as the relay nFNIs with magnetoelectric nFNIs at the end to send/receive signals. The wire would self-assemble using the proteins, which would also insulate the signal to reduce noise. Ideally, the wire would attach itself to the skull and the targeted neuron allowing for direct stimulation. The exploration of this concept is what I\u2019d like to make into my dissertation at Rice University. Rice has shown to be the pinnacle in regards to nano neural engineering through countless innovations done by its world-class staff. I knew Rice was perfect for me after pouring over the research conducted as I investigated nFNIs. With their guidance, I can use nFNIs to design and implement a minimally-invasive, bidirectional brain-computer interface.\nAfter my time at Rice University, I hope to found a research company centered around research further into nFNIs and making this BCI safely usable by humans. Ultimately, I hope the BCI would be a versatile treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease by allowing direct activation and monitoring of the affected neurons. The BCI could also enhance neuroprosthetics by allowing sensations such as touch to be sent back to the brain. The number of medical and scientific advancements possible with this technology are genuinely countless. The creation of this system will be my life\u2019s work that I have been doing since I was in middle school. I hope to continue this work at Rice University, where I\u2019ll get the guidance I could not receive anywhere else."}, {"Prompt Length": 1308, "Output Length": 106, "prompt": "(178) WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM VOLTAIRE'S PHILOSOPHY | InsightJunky - YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASeweCcVCmE\n\nTranscript:\n(00:00) do you think everything that happens happens for a reason have you ever thought about the deeper meaning of reality have you ever thought about what is the meaning of life these are some of the questions that have plagued humanity for generations because frankly we don't really know the answers to them but see here's the best part we don't have to know the answer just searching for the answer itself makes us much more wiser and more intelligent than we are right now this is what philosophy can do for you it can show\n(00:30) you how to think how to argue and how to come up to your own conclusions most people think that they don't really need philosophy or they think that philosophy is reserved for the extremely intellectual people but this couldn't be further from the truth let me ask you something do you believe in a religion do you not believe in a religion do you live by a set of moral rules all of these questions can be understood through philosophy but I can understand why some of you might not read philosophy it's usually written in\n(00:58) complex words and even then it can be hard to understand what people are saying that's why in this video I tell you about two concepts that I really liked about philosophy from the French philosopher Voltaire these are the concepts of empiricism and religious tolerance now the philosophy of empiricism basically states that we learn about life only through experience so in order to tell you a little bit about empiricism I'm going to tell you a story called Candide written by Voltaire you may or may not have heard it before\n(01:28) Candide lived in his uncle's palace with his cousin Cunegonde and his tutor Pangloss who was a philosopher now Pangloss was an optimist and he believed that the world we were living in is the best of all possible worlds now Kuna gone and Candide fell in love and then can deeds uncle found out and he kicked Candide out he was then forced into the military and beaten and nearly killed then he was miraculously saved by a man called Steam's and he started to live with him and work for him then one day Candide while\n(01:58) walking on the street notice a really sick man on the street almost about to die and it turned out that it was his old tutor Pangloss Pangloss told him that the army killed his uncle's estate and his beloved hyuna gand now obviously Candide was very depressed when he heard about this eventually Candide James and his tutor Pangloss decided to go to another country and during the course of events James and Pangloss were killed Candide somehow managed to escape and out of a rear turn of events he found Kuna gone again but turns out\n(02:30) she was the slave of two men he then killed both of the men rescued her and then somehow they got separated again so you might have noticed a train here a lot of bad things happened to all the people in the story but ultimately everyone makes it to a small farm in Turkey and they are now safe but turns out that because they're safe they are now bored and they still haven't been able to figure out what the meaning of life was they then decided that maybe the best thing to do was to just work on your garden and that is how you can\n(03:00) truly achieve happiness by just working on your garden this story basically gives us the conclusion that we cannot find happiness by thinking about how the world should be but that we need to take action in our own lives and fix our own lives and maybe then we can find happiness so this story makes us think about a lot of philosophical questions and the thing about these questions is that there is no right or wrong answer but these questions can always serve us as brain exercises the more you think about them the more arguments you can\n(03:30) make for and against the topic the more wise you're going to become now I tell you about the other philosophy that Voltaire really believed in and that was religious tolerance Voltaire always believed in religious tolerance and freedom of speech so the back story is that Voltaire was living in France at the time and in this time there was a lot of religious intolerance in France he used to admire England because at that time they promoted freedom of religion and their society gave birth to one of his idols Isaac Newton so this is\n(03:58) why water actually started to prefer the English society as opposed to where he was born so coming back to religious tolerance I believe that freedom of speech and religious tolerance are the two things that are necessary for any country to develop so we can think about this in very practical terms if history had ever shown that religious intolerance and lack of freedom of speech actually moved a society forward then I would be the first person to support it but never has history ever shown that releases hatred or lack of freedom of\n(04:29) speech has advanced a society in fact whenever a society loses these characteristics it doesn't survive for very long Walter had a famous saying I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it that is the real spirit of a democracy and this is why I believe that we all should be familiar with these concepts of philosophy so we can live in a free and democratic world so my message to all of you who are watching this video is to not take my opinion about anything you don't have to agree with everything\n(05:00) that I say but always remember to think deeply and think very carefully analyze yourself and the world fix yourself become a better version of who you are think for yourself and form your own opinions imagine of what we could achieve if we all started to think this way take care keep learning and keep hope raise your voice against injustice and respect everyone's right to speed that's how we move forward in this world that's all

At the workshop,\n\nFrank Yoo\n, Lyft\u2019s head of UX and product design at Lyft, talked about the Lyft re-design. I learned useful design insights from his presentation and I wanted to share some takeaways with my design team at work. On May 26th, I met\nVicki Tan\n, Lyft\u2019s product designer, at Tech in Motion + Verizon Present: Data and Design Tech Talk. She generously shared how their design team did A/B testing, and answered a few questions I had regarding their UX challenges. In order to better support my takeaways presentation, I did extra homework by researching more about the re-design online, and then creating a case study.\n\nWorkshop Notes\n1.

Lyft Redesign Goals\n\u009a\u2022 Scale for the future\n\u2022 Provide better context\n\u2022 Improve ergonomics and discoverability\n\n3. Lyft Design Principles\n\u2022 Nail the basics \u2014 Clear choice and context\n\u2022 Build confidence \u2014 Consistency and transparent\n\u2022 Be unique \u2014 Own-able and delightful\n\n1\u20133 are notes I took from\n\nFrank Yoo\n\u2019s presentation at the Design Gurus Summit workshop.\n\nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs\nLyft used this concept to define their design principles in a Pyramid shape. I was fascinated by how Lyft integrated psychology to define the principles order of importance.\n\nAs a designer, I often run into situations where people have different ideas about design decisions; it can be tough to judge without any design principles. Therefore, with the encouragement from my colleague\n\nKlara Pelcl\n, I convinced our leadership to let me and\nJules Cheung\ninitiate and collaboratively set core design principles among our design team.\nWe brainstormed together and created our own 6 principles: Know Your User, Clarity, Consistency, Efficiency, Collaboration and Beauty. By looking at Lyft\u2019s design principles graphic, it encouraged me to think about what we can do next to apply them in practice.\n\nOnline Resource\nUX Challenges\nI wanted to know what type of UX challenges Lyft faced while designing the app. I was glad to find some useful resource from Nectar Design, where\n\nFrank\ndid a webinar about how Lyft handles UX challenges, and used the same pyramid method to tackle UX challenges. Here is a summary from Nectar Design:\n\u2022 Usability \u2014 It must solve a compelling user issue\n\u009a\u2022 Reliability \u2014 Everything must work seamlessly and be as transparent as possible (Ex: ride times and costs)\n\u2022 Differentiate \u2014 It must be visually and interactively interesting (Ex: Lyft\u2019s glowing buttons and interactive options menu)\nReasons for Redesign\nDuring the webinar,\n\nFrank\ntalked about the reasons they re-designed the Lyft app, something I wish I could have asked him in person. Again thanks to Nectar Design I was able to find the reasons:\n\u2022 \u009aPoor representation of the driver that is requested\n\u2022 \u009aNo transparency about price or estimated time of arrival\n\u2022 Cars were not directional\n\u2022 \u009aPoor use of color\n\u2022 Options panel awkwardly placed\n\u009a\u2022 Request Lyft is vague for first time users\nSuccess Analysis\nNow you probably want to know what results the Lyft re-design achieved. I might not be able to cover everything here but I\u2019ll share what I have so far.\n\n1. Enhanced Transparency and Safety\nAfter the system matches you with a driver, you can see all the important information you need \u2014 your driver\u2019s name and the color/model of his/her car. More importantly, displaying the driver\u2019s license plate number helps you quickly pick the right car so you know you\u2019re with the right driver.\n2. Better Usage of Primary Color\nFrom what I can see, Lyft uses hot pink as the primary color, and purple as the secondary. During the workshop\n\ntalked about the pink color and how they decided to limit the use of it, applying it only in important situations. My understanding is that they made the pink color an action item color, such as the logo, the \u201cRequest Lyft\u201d button, the destination pin and \u201cFree Rides\u201d on your profile menu.\n\n3. Price Estimate Feature\nThe new UI includes a feature that allows users to get a ride\u2019s quote. By clicking on \u201cPrice estimate\u201d (see the image above), you have a good understanding of how much the ride is going to cost you. For example, a trip to Spicy King restaurant in Chinatown will cost me about $7-$11 from my pickup location.\n\n4. Made It Ergonomic\nErgonomics make the user experience much better. The older app design had actions at both the top and bottom of the screen, which made it harder to use because your fingers had to cross the screen back and forth. What about the new design? I really like it myself as a user for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 Tab Menu\nAll important menu actions are now at the bottom of the app, where you can select a type of ride you need (Carpool, Line, Regular Lyft, Plus and Premier), and you can set a pickup location right after. The UI for further actions in the request flow are also located in the same spot, resulting in a seamless experience.\n\u2022 Lyft Cars\nOn the map, the little Lyft cars were re-designed nicely, with a hint of pink and purple that shows color consistency across the app. Cars now turn directionally, which is a big help to people like me who don\u2019t have a great sense of direction with maps \u2014 I can now easily figure out if the car I requested is heading towards my location or if the driver is going the opposite way (which also explains why sometime it takes longer than the estimated arrival time).\n\u2022 Options Before Car Arrival\nThe new UI provides 4 options (Cancel, Split, Send ETA, Call driver) to users before their car arrives. I remember the hard time I had with the older UI, when I had to call my driver but couldn\u2019t find the button. Ease of use is much greater with all the options displayed up in front.\nUX Research\nLyft has different type of users \u2014 passengers and drivers, how does UX research collaborate with design? As I mentioned in the beginning,\n\nVicki Tan\nshared her insights during the panel at Tech in Motion + Verizon Present: Data and Design Tech Talk, where I learned quite a bit about their research.\n\u2022 Qualitative data vs. Quantitative data\nLike many other companies, Lyft is metrics-driven and focuses on quantitative analysis (usually the numbers and graphs can be shared with the teams and the stakeholders in many formats, such as email, keynotes). However, quantitative data needs analysis to be useful. Because of that, qualitative data comes in handy and that\u2019s what they focus on more now.\n\n\u2022 Gather User Feedback\nAccording to\n\n, Lyft invites real users (both passengers and drivers) to do regular weekly Q&A sessions in the office to ask them questions and listen to their feedback. By doing so, the design team learns if the users understand the features and what can be improved.\nI believe Lyft also uses other methods to collect qualitative data, so I did some research online and it looks like Lyft has been using \u201cLookback\u201d to aggregate a database of experiences where they can generate a montage of user feedback to better understand their needs. I tried \u201cLookback\u201d a few months ago, and found it very easy to record prototype testing on mobile. At my company, our design and UX research team have been using \u201cValidately\u201d to do both moderated and unmoderated testing.\n\n\u2022 A/B testing\nDuring re-design progress, Lyft ran many A/B tests. As a result,\n\nfound that the design they wanted was not the design the users wanted. At work, my design team faces this struggle all the time where we have different assumptions about what works for users the best. Without A/B testing, we are essentially designing features that suit our best interests, and might not be what the real users need.\n\u2022 Outcome\nAccording to Nectar Design, Lyft has conducted hundreds of hours of user testing and validates their assumptions along the way. This is good because it builds confidence in the team, stakeholders, and customers.\n\nConclusion\nHere is what I learned from doing this case study:\n\nOrganizing and structuring design principles is just as important as creating them in the first place. I\u2019ll continue finding ways to better structure the design principles we created at work, and visualize them so that everyone can get a good understanding of it across the organization.\nDon\u2019t be afraid of doing product re-designs. If you have good reasons and understand what the usability issues are, start planning! Get to know your real users \u2014 user testing is the key. Collect as much quantitative user behavior data as you can, then analyze and categorize them to make sure you have solid qualitative data to support re-design thinking. Follow the cycle of design, release, get user feedback and iterate.\nLyft\u2019s re-design is a great example to show how to create a successful product. If you care about your users, put yourself in their shoes to understand what they need and what they actually do when using a product. If you don\u2019t have a UX research team yet, build one or become a researcher yourself! At work, I work closely with our UX research team, they help the design team tons by recruiting users, setting up user testing, and analyzing the massive data comes in every month. Thanks to their hard work, the design team can take over the numbers and metrics, analyze further to define specific usability areas, and to communicate re-design decisions to our leadership.\nLyft\u2019s re-design case study helped me understand how other companies generate business value by implementing great design in both UI and UX. It gives me confidence that if we apply similar principles, and keep doing what we are doing on UX research, our product team can help the company product achieve much more success in the near future.\n\nGive an overview of this case study"}, {"Prompt Length": 1838, "Output Length": 88, "prompt": "Does my login function below have any lockout functionality?\n\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get\\_user\\_model\nfrom rest\\_framework import permissions, viewsets, filters, status, generics, views\nfrom apps.users.serializers import \\*\nfrom rest\\_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, AllowAny\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.views import TokenObtainPairView, TokenRefreshView\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.exceptions import TokenError, InvalidToken\nfrom rest\\_framework.response import Response\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.contrib.sites.shortcuts import get\\_current\\_site\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core.mail import EmailMessage\nfrom django.utils.http import urlsafe\\_base64\\_encode, urlsafe\\_base64\\_decode\nfrom django.contrib.sites.shortcuts import get\\_current\\_site\nfrom django.urls import reverse\\_lazy\nfrom django.contrib.auth.tokens import PasswordResetTokenGenerator\nfrom django.utils.encoding import force\\_bytes, force\\_str\nfrom .models import Document\nfrom rest\\_framework.parsers import MultiPartParser, FormParser\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseNotFound\nfrom django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied\nfrom apps.help\\_requests.models import HelpRequest\nfrom .permissions import DocumentPermission\nclass UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for viewing user instances\"\"\"\n\n http\\_method\\_names = ['get']\n serializer\\_class = UserSerializer\n permission\\_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)\n\n def get\\_queryset(self):\n if self.request.user.is\\_superuser: # Admin users can see info of every user\n return get\\_user\\_model().objects.all()\n else:\n # Normal users only see information about themselves\n return get\\_user\\_model().objects.filter(pk=self.request.user.id)\nclass RegistrationViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet, TokenObtainPairView):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for registering new users\"\"\"\n serializer\\_class = RegisterSerializer\n permission\\_classes = (AllowAny,)\n http\\_method\\_names = ['post']\n\n def create(self, request, \\*args, \\*\\*kwargs):\n serializer = self.get\\_serializer(data=request.data)\n\n serializer.is\\_valid(raise\\_exception=True)\n user = serializer.save()\n # Create refresh token for user using simplejwt\n refresh = RefreshToken.for\\_user(user)\n res = {\n \"refresh\": str(refresh),\n \"access\": str(refresh.access\\_token),\n }\n\n return Response({\n \"user\": serializer.data,\n \"refresh\": res[\"refresh\"],\n \"token\": res[\"access\"]\n }, status=status.HTTP\\_201\\_CREATED)\nclass LoginViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet, TokenObtainPairView):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for logging in users.

Becoming an influential leader.\nb. Being accepted by a group\nc. Being well liked\nd. setting/achieving challenging personal goals \n\" is readily answerable from this content \"When your team members succeed, you might be tempted to show them off to the rest of your organization. But while some people thrive in the spotlight, others dread being \"paraded around.\"\n\nManaging a group of people with different personalities is never easy. But if you're managing or leading a team, it's essential to know what motivates your people, how they respond to feedback and praise, and what tasks fit them well.\n\nDavid McClelland's Human Motivation Theory allows you to identify people's motivating drivers. This can then help you to give praise and feedback effectively, assign them suitable tasks, and keep them motivated.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore McClelland's Human Motivation Theory, and look at how you can use it to manage and lead your team more effectively.\n\nNote:\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory is also known as Three Needs Theory, Acquired Needs Theory, Motivational Needs Theory, and Learned Needs Theory.\n\nUnderstanding McClelland's Theory\nIn the early 1940s, Abraham Maslow created his theory of needs. This identified the basic needs that human beings have, in order of their importance: physiological needs, safety needs, and the needs for belonging, self-esteem and \"self-actualization\".\n\nLater, David McClelland built on this work in his 1961 book, \"The Achieving Society.\" He identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. [1]\n\nAccording to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).\n\nMcClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.\n\nThese characteristics are as follows:\n\nDominant Motivator\n\nCharacteristics of This Person\n\nAchievement\n\nHas a strong need to set and accomplish challenging goals.\nTakes calculated risks to accomplish their goals.\nLikes to receive regular feedback on their progress and achievements.\nOften likes to work alone.\nAffiliation\n\nWants to belong to the group.\nWants to be liked, and will often go along with whatever the rest of the group wants to do.\nFavors collaboration over competition.\nDoesn't like high risk or uncertainty.\nPower\n\nWants to control and influence others.\nLikes to win arguments.\nEnjoys competition and winning.\nEnjoys status and recognition.\nNote:\nThose with a strong power motivator are often divided into two groups: personal and institutional. People with a personal power drive want to control others, while people with an institutional power drive like to organize the efforts of a team to further the company's goals. As you can probably imagine, those with an institutional power need are usually more desirable as team members!\n\nUsing the Theory\nMcClelland's theory can help you to identify the dominant motivators of people on your team. You can then use this information to influence how you set goals and provide feedback, and how you motivate and reward team members.\n\nYou can also use these motivators to craft, or design, the job around your team members, ensuring a better fit.\n\nLet's look at the steps for using McClelland's theory:\n\nStep 1: Identify Drivers\nExamine your team to determine which of the three motivators is dominant for each person. You can probably identify drivers based on personality and past actions.\n\nFor instance, perhaps one of your team members always takes charge of the group when you assign a project. They speak up in meetings to persuade people, and delegate responsibilities to others to meet the goals of the group. They like to be in control of the final deliverables. This team member is likely primarily driven by power.\n\nYou might have another team member who never speaks during meetings. They always agree with the group, work hard to manage conflict when it occurs, and visibly become uncomfortable when you talk about doing high-risk, high-reward projects. This person is likely to have a strong need for affiliation.\n\nStep 2: Structure Your Approach\nBased on the driving motivators of your workers, structure your leadership style and project assignments around each individual team member. This will help ensure that they all stay engaged, motivated, and happy with the work they're doing.\n\nExamples of Using the Theory\nLet's take a closer look at how to manage team members who are driven by each of McClelland's three motivators:\n\nAchievement\nPeople motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.\n\nWhen providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right \u2013 and wrong \u2013 so that they can improve.\n\nAffiliation\nPeople motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.\n\nWhen providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.\n\nPower\nThose with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.\n\nWhen providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals.\n\nComparative Theories\nMcClelland's theory of needs is not the only theory about worker motivation. Sirota's Three-Factor Theory also presents three motivating factors that workers need to stay motivated and excited about what they're doing: equity/fairness, achievement, and camaraderie.\n\nSirota's theory states that we all start a new job with lots of enthusiasm and motivation to do well. But over time, due to bad company policies and poor work conditions, many of us lose our motivation and excitement.\n\nThis is different from McClelland's theory, which states that we all have one dominant motivator that moves us forward, and this motivator is based on our culture and life experiences.\n\nUse your best judgment when motivating and engaging your team. Understanding a variety of motivational theories will help you decide which approach is best in any given situation.\n\nNote:\nYou may also see these abbreviations for McClelland's three motivators: Achievement (nAch), Affiliation (nAff), and Power (nPow).\n\nKey Points\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory states that every person has one of three main driving motivators: the needs for achievement, affiliation, or power. These motivators are not inherent; we develop them through our culture and life experiences.\n\nAchievers like to solve problems and achieve goals. Those with a strong need for affiliation don't like to stand out or take risk, and they value relationships above anything else. Those with a strong power motivator like to control others and be in charge.\n\nYou can use this information to lead, praise, and motivate your team more effectively, and to better structure your team's roles.\""}, {"Prompt Length": 1620, "Output Length": 152, "prompt": "Please generate a list of legislative issues discussed in this article: \nVoters in multiple states acted to protect the integrity of American democracy in Tuesday's elections by rejecting some of the most prominent candidates who embraced lies about the 2020 election and threatened to ignore the will of the electorate.\n\nThese are crucial and heartening results, but urgent work remains to be done.\n\nCongress now should do its part and act, in its final weeks in session, to clarify and strengthen the federal law governing the counting and certifying of electoral votes in presidential elections. It needs to do this before control of the House passes, in all likelihood, to a Republican majority.\n\nThe 135-year-old law, known as the Electoral Count Act, is chock-full of confusing and ambiguous provisions, and legal scholars have long warned that it could trigger a crisis. That's exactly what happened after the 2020 election, when Donald Trump and his associates exploited the law's vague and arcane language to claim that they could overturn the will of the voters. That exploitation led directly to the violence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nSince then, several Republicans have joined Democrats in agreeing that a major reform to the law is necessary -- a rare point of bipartisanship. The Senate introduced reform legislation over the summer, and the House passed its bill in September. While the bills contain minor differences, either would be a huge improvement over the status quo.\n\nThe most significant changes to the law would make it far harder, if not impossible, to pull off the schemes that Mr. Trump and his allies tried to use to overturn the 2020 election and hold on to power.\n\nFor example, the law currently makes it very easy for members of Congress to obstruct and delay the final count of electoral votes on Jan. 6; any objection lodged by one representative and one senator will do the trick. Republicans took advantage of this after the 2020 election, including when Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley introduced meritless objections simply to slow the process. The new bills would raise the bar, by requiring at least one-fifth of both houses of Congress to sign on before an objection can be lodged, and by strictly limiting the grounds for any objection.\n\nThe reform bills would also clarify that the vice president's role on Jan. 6 is purely ministerial, and that, despite Mr. Trump's claims, the vice president has no authority to throw out electoral votes or accept a slate different from the one a state has already certified.\n\nCongress can also do more to protect the integrity of a presidential election before the electoral votes arrive in Washington. What happens in the states, after the ballots are counted, is just as important, if not more so. The 2022 midterms featured multiple Republican candidates for governor and secretary of state, like Mark Finchem in Arizona, who have suggested they would reject the will of their own voters.\n\nArizona voters rejected Mr. Finchem's bid for secretary of state. Similarly extreme Republican candidates for secretary of state have also lost in states including Michigan, New Mexico and Minnesota, and Republican gubernatorial candidates who engaged in election denial lost in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nElection deniers, however, remain a potent force on the right: More than 220 candidates who questioned the 2020 election have won state or federal office, and about 30 of those have said the election was stolen or rigged.\n\nThe reforms proposed in the bills address this threat by making clear that state officials must count their votes according to the state laws in place on Election Day. They may not change the result after the fact simply because they don't like it. Critically, the new bills also steer disputes over vote tallies to the courts, where judges -- not partisan officials -- have the final say.\n\nEven if these reforms pass, they are, like any other law, only words on paper. In order to work, they need to be upheld by those in positions of power, who are committed to acting in the interests of American democracy and the rule of law. Still, both the Senate and House bills are far better than what we have right now, and either one would go a long way to ensuring that the electoral-count law cannot be used as a tool for subverting the election in 2024 or beyond. Congress needs to pass the overhaul now, when it has willing majorities in both houses and well before anyone casts a ballot in 2024.\n\nDemocrats also should move quickly on the debt ceiling and on immigration.\n\nThey should act before the end of this legislative session to ensure that the federal government can borrow the money it needs to meet its obligations over the next two years -- including recent and important increases in federal funding for expanding the production of renewable energy; investing in roads, high-speed internet, unleaded pipes and other infrastructure; and supporting local government, including money for law enforcement. Congress agreed to those measures after months of negotiation and compromise, and Democrats should do everything they can to defend the achievement.\n\nThe government is expected to reach the limit of its congressionally authorized borrowing capacity, known as the debt ceiling, at some point in 2023. For the government to pay its bills, Congress must raise that limit -- but House Republicans have made clear that if the vote is deferred until the next Congress, they will threaten to withhold consent, risking a global financial crisis to compel the White House to accept reductions in federal spending.\n\nIt's a serious threat: Republicans have engaged in similar brinkmanship repeatedly in recent years, most notably in 2011, when the possibility that the government might fail to meet its obligations produced a measurable increase in the interest rates the government must pay to borrow money, costing taxpayers an estimated $1.3 billion. That standoff also imposed limits on federal spending that delayed the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nDemocrats could avert the immediate danger by raising the debt ceiling high enough to permit necessary federal borrowing until after the next presidential election. But there is no reason to preserve the debt ceiling as a problem for future Congresses. Democrats can end this dangerous game by passing the legislation to eliminate the debt ceiling that has been introduced by Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado. There is simply no reason for Congress to vote again on spending that already has been authorized.\n\nSome Democrats worry that eliminating the debt ceiling would expose them to charges of fiscal recklessness. And not just from Republicans. President Biden just last month described the proposed elimination of the debt ceiling as ''irresponsible.'' The president's choice of words was misguided and deeply counterproductive. Preserving the debt ceiling is a reckless and dangerous policy cloaked in the appearance of responsibility.\n\nFinally, the broken state of the nation's immigration system is an issue urgently in need of congressional action, and one on which there is a plausible path forward. In the closing weeks of the current Congress, members from both parties should restart negotiations on legislation to fix one particular piece of the immigration system: The process by which migrants claim asylum.\n\nThis board has endorsed the framework of a deal put forward last year by Republicans, including SenatorJohn Cornyn of Texas, and Democrats, including SenatorKyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The core of the bill would significantly increase the government's capacity to process asylum claims, by allowing those with a legitimate fear of persecution to settle safely in the United States and by making it more difficult for those without legitimate claims to enter or remain in the country.\n\nThe bill also offers a road map for cooperation on other issues over the next two years. It is narrowly focused on a specific problem; the solutions it puts forward would require significant compromise on both sides, and for both sides, it improves on the status quo. Even as the current Congress wraps up its work, those who will remain, and those who will soon be joining them, can start looking for other issues on which progress may still be possible."}, {"Prompt Length": 1258, "Output Length": 135, "prompt": "Simia\nSimia is a tiny planet the size of a large moon, orbiting a star on the border of the Luxian Empire. The planet is a warm, humid place, covered almost entirely in untamed jungles. While signs of ancient civilizations are scattered around the planet, currently only one area is inhabited: a pocket of land about the size of a large city, surrounded by a ring of nearly impassable mountains that the inhabitants call the Holy Ring. This is where the only extant civilization on the planet - the Simians - lives. The untamed jungles outside the mountain ring are full of dangerous wildlife that rarely pass through the mountains, making the interior area very safe.\n\nSimian society is rather primitive, comparable to the Bronze Age on Earth. The Simians travel by foot or by riding on tamed beasts of burden from their jungles. They live in wooden \u201ctreehouses\u201d mounted on pillars, or literally built in trees in the more rural areas. These treehouses are connected by swaying rope bridges that allow the inhabitants to move between buildings without touching the ground.\n\nThe Simian society is patriarchal in nature, and their religion is woven into the very fabric of their everyday lives. Even the Holy Ring is believed to be supernatural in nature, as the inhabitants believe their gods raised up the mountains to give them a safe place to live away from the wild beasts outside. They also believe the royal family is directly descended from Shi Huo, the Simian god of war and trickery, through a mortal that he took as his original mate, so the only living member of the \u201csacred bloodline\u201d - Prince Wukong - is revered both as a ruler and as a partially divine being.\n\nThe Simians value individual freedom very highly. This manifests in several of their cultural practices. For example: because Simians believe that the union between a couple is private and no one needs to be involved but the couple, they have no concept of marriage, much less one sanctioned by religion or government. Instead, they simply choose a mate and begin living together.\n\nThe Simians also value the ability to fight and hold one\u2019s own in a battle. Their people have historically had to fight many wild beasts to survive, and while an appearance from one of those beasts is much rarer now, the cultural emphasis on being a warrior still holds strong. This manifests in their religion as well, as Shi Huo is the deity most commonly worshiped.\n\nFinally, although the Simians have no idea, the Luxian Empire has been observing their civilization for quite some time now in preparation for invasion.\nSimians\nSimians are short, monkey-like creatures with long tails and fur. They are bipedal and though they are capable of running rapidly on all fours, they usually prefer not to. Their fur and eyes come in varying shades of brown, black, or flaxen. They usually keep their fur relatively short because of their warm environment, but will sometimes allow it to grow longer, especially on their heads, for the sake of looking attractive. They average 5 feet in height and 55-65 years in lifespan. They are small, light, and fast, and are excellent climbers and swimmers. They often use their tails as an additional limb.\n\nThe Simians wear clothing comparable to that of ancient Chinese peasants or, depending on their social status, semi-nobility. Most lower-ranking monkeys wear simple tops and trousers that don\u2019t get in their way as they work and climb. Fancier clothing for special occasions, or that worn by nobility, consists more of flowing robes and elaborate decorations. The priests and priestesses wear blue and white, while the royal family tends to dress in variations of red and gold. The fighters wear bronze breastplates with intricate designs, and the temple guards have a slightly fancier and lighter version of the breastplate purely for ceremonial purposes. Every Simian, regardless of their social status, has certain patterns or characters embroidered into their clothing. Some are believed to bring good luck. Others represent devotion to the gods. Others might represent the wearer\u2019s family history.\nSimian Religion\nThe Simians believe in three gods: Shi Huo, the \u201cStone Monkey\u201d warrior trickster god, and the first deity to appear; Kwamya, the merciful mother goddess of healing and blessings, and the second deity to appear; and Tapanga, the fierce protector goddess of perfect balance, daughter of Shi Huo and Kwamya. Their religion teaches that Shi Huo originally had a mortal mate, and the semi-divine children they had together became the current Simian royal bloodline. When the mortal mate passed away, Shi Huo took the goddess Kwamya as his new mate and Tapanga resulted from their union. Their relationship forms the basis of the Simian practice of taking mates.\n\nRituals and traditions play an important role in the Simian religion. Most of the worship centers around a large stone temple in Huaguo, the Simian capital city, and many minor shrines are scattered throughout the Ring. The Simians observe holidays such as the solstice, the birth of Tapanga, the creation of the Ring, and more, often with huge festivals.\n\nThe Simians also believe that the Holy Ring was created by the gods to keep the wild beasts or \u201cmonsters\u201d out of their home. Their ancient stories tell of a world rocked by chaos, where monkeys lived in constant fear of being eaten alive by unbeatable monsters. One day, the sky opened up and Shi Huo descended, wiping out many of the monsters after a fierce battle. He then led the surviving monkeys into war against the other beasts and drove them away. Afterward, he conjured up the mountains around their new home to protect them.\n\nBecause the Simians believe their royalty is descended from Shi Huo, the priesthood and the royal family are closely linked. In more recent years, the priests have begun gradually assuming more and more power for themselves and attempting to control the actions of the royal family. To their chagrin, the current heir to the throne - Prince Wukong - couldn\u2019t care less what the priests tell him to do."}, {"Prompt Length": 2257, "Output Length": 190, "prompt": "One of the most significant criminal enquiries undertaken at Cardiff Docks was a case involving large quantities of drugs brought from the West Indies. It was a lengthy investigation that began with the death of a scuba diver whose body was recovered from the Queen Alexandra Dock.\n\nDuring March 1982, several anonymous telephone calls were received about a man alleged to have gone missing while using sub-aqua diving gear at the docks. Calls were made both to the South Wales Police and to the British Transport Police at the docks, initially by a female and later by a male. With each call, more details emerged- the man was described as West Indian and the location was given as the Queen Alexandra Dock.\n\nSearches by Police Underwater Search Teams did not find anything. Visibility in the dock was extremely poor and as they worked, huge conga eels slithered and scraped past the divers- it was not a pleasant experience in the inky blackness. When HMS Cardiff put into docks on a courtesy visit the opportunity was taken for a sonar sweep to be carried out. Once again nothing was found- what happens to a human body submerged in water depends on many things and the chances of finding one were minimal.\n\nHowever, some weeks after the calls began, two tugs were assisting a ship leaving the Queen Alexandra Dock and as they took up the tow their powerful screws churned up the water and a body was flushed to the surface. It was a body dressed in sub-aqua diving gear and was showing signs of having been in the water some time. At the mortuary, with the diving gear removed, it was found to be that of a West Indian male and all the circumstances suggested that this was the missing man. The heavy diving gear may also have been why the body had not surfaced earlier. A conference between senior officers of the South Wales and British Transport Police did not find agreement on whether the death should be regarded as suspicious.\n\nThe post mortem examination was carried out by eminent pathologist Professor Sir Bernard Knight, who found it difficult to establish the cause of death. But significantly, none of the tiny microbes known as diotodes, normally present in water, were found in the bone marrow possibly indicating the deceased did not die from drowning. There were also several interesting marks on the body, the significance of which would become apparent later. A square bruise was seen on the right side of the face and a similar one on the chest. There was also an unusual wide mark on the left wrist. One other piece of vital evidence came from examination of the diving equipment; the valve on the oxygen cylinder was closed, pointing to the fact that diving had been completed by the time the death occurred.\n\nDI Vic Miller began an investigation and looked for a connection with the West Indies. The shipping line Geest operated between South Wales and the West Indies and one of their boats- the MV Geestland had been diverted into Cardiff Docks a few weeks earlier, about the time the diver had gone missing. Crucially, it had unloaded its cargo of bananas on the north side of the Queens Dock, exactly where the body had been brought to the surface by the tug! The Geestland was brought back into Cardiff and dry docked and something very significant was quickly found. A length of chain was discovered hanging below the hull near the propeller. It was about 20 feet long and on the end was a shackle secured with a nut and bolt. That answered a question that had been puzzling the officers ever since the body had been found; an unexplained spanner had been discovered tied to the wet suit chest. When the spanner was matched to the shackle, they were an exact fit. And one of the Geestland\u2019s engineers told of hearing a strange metallic sound coming from the hull during the voyage from the West Indies. A picture was emerging and the police suspected that a container had been secured to the ship\u2019s hull before the vessel left the West Indies and was to be recovered when the ship arrived in the UK. The dead diver was apparently part of a well-organised drug running syndicate!\n\nFollowing a different line of enquiry, the man who had made the anonymous calls was traced and he identified the deceased as his friend- Peter Macdonald Jones. The dead man\u2019s mother told police that he had had a girlfriend known as \u2018The Duchess\u2019 who worked at a department store in Reading. At the store, a former employee was tracked to South Wales and enquiries at a store in Cardiff found that a new member of staff had recently been distressed; she had confided to a colleague that her boyfriend had died. Back in Reading, enquiries established that there were connections to some fairly undesirable people involved in the local drug scene.\n\nThe woman, known as \u2018The Duchess\u2019, was arrested and immediately lied about her identity. Realising she may have made a mistake she fell silent and remained that way throughout an initial interview. She was taken home for a search of her flat in Newport. At first, nothing incriminating was found nor was there anything to link her to Peter Jones or even to Reading. Seemingly, she was a woman without a past but as the search progressed, officers noticed that the only indication of any wealth in the flat were two original paintings by L.S. Lowery on the lounge wall. DI Miller examined the paintings and took the back off them. Between the canvas and the backboard of one was a photograph of Peter Jones and in the second was a photograph of her and Peter together. Here was the connection the police had been searching for.\n\nWith her boyfriend dead, The Duchess could see that she had nowhere else to go and her best option now was to help the police. Over time, DI Vic Miller established a rapport and her story was slowly unravelled; it proved to be a revealing story indeed. She had been set up in the flat by her boyfriend, Peter Jones, and his associate, James Timothy for the purpose of providing \u2018a safe house\u2019 for drug importation operations in South Wales. Jones was a married man and lived in Reading as did Timothy, who was believed to be heavily involved in the drugs underworld. Almost every month she would meet the two men and a canister of drugs would be recovered from a ship bringing bananas from the West Indies. She would fetch the drugs from the docks and drive them to an address in Reading, having been given a cover story in case she was stopped. The operation had been going on for nearly five years, and each consignment meant anything up to \u00a3500,000 in street value. It was understood that no-one involved in the drug trafficking should display any outward sign of wealth. Recently though, Peter Jones had begun to deviate from the rules and shortly before he died he had put down a \u00a35,000 deposit on a Porsche motor car. He had also purchased a plot of land in a residential area in Barbados and was having a bungalow built. It was not a wise move; Timothy had learned of the deposit on the car from an associate in Reading\n\nBoth Timothy and Jones were experienced divers and on that March night in 1982 they set out on one more drug recovery operation from beneath a ship. They were probably expecting the Geestland to be at Barry Docks but bad weather made Cardiff a preferred option. It was a foul night when The Duchess drove Peter Jones and James Timothy to Cardiff Docks- a gale was blowing and it was lashing with rain- in many respects perfect conditions to undertake their hazardous activity, safe from casual observation. The men changed into their diving gear and as usual it was arranged they would be dropped off by The Duchess who would return later to avoid having the car attract attention. Through the rain and the darkness, she watched them descend the steps into the uninviting water and then left; she would not see Peter Jones again.\n\nThe Duchess returned at the prearranged time but Timothy came back to the car alone. He had his diving kit but there was no sign of any drugs and he was vague and evasive about what had happened to Peter Jones. As they waited for around half an hour The Duchess became angry and began to panic, believing that Timothy had done something to him. Eventually, she drove Timothy to Newport, intending to go back and look for Jones in daylight. Timothy led her to believe that an argument had taken place about the drugs and that he had ended up hitting Jones with a lead diving belt and he had fallen back into the water. Timothy had returned to the car believing that Jones would get out alright, but obviously he had not. The Duchess made enquiries herself amongst other drug dealers to see if Jones had been heard of but she did not go as far as reporting her missing man to the police.\n\nWith the discovery of the body the investigation had intensified. One aspect concentrated on the enquiry to trace and interview Timothy, whilst others took on many of the other lines of enquiry including the Reading connection. Many long hours were spent as enquiries spread the length and breadth of the land. Officers learnt that both Peter Jones and James Timothy had contacts in the West Indies and had recently visited the islands. There was evidence that Timothy and Jones had been associates for ten years at least and both had bought diving equipment from the same shop in Falmouth five years previously.\n\nBy the middle of June, Timothy had been arrested, taken to Cardiff and interviewed at the BTP Divisional HQ. But throughout the interview he made no reply except to indicate he did not wish to answer questions. His reply was always the same and he never once lost his cool or became perturbed- he simply remained silent. Despite the serious allegations, Timothy was allowed bail and was interviewed on a further five or six occasions. The only variation from his veil of silence was an occasional stock answer- \u201cI have never murdered anyone in my life. I have the highest regard for human life.\u201d\n\nThe truth about the events that took place in the dark on the quayside at the Queen Alexandra Dock between Jones and Timothy has never been established. The police investigation had always been led with a murder or manslaughter charge in mind but although there was plenty of circumstantial evidence it was insufficient to bring a charge of homicide. No drugs were ever recovered by the police as a result of this incident, nor were any seen by The Duchess when she collected Timothy. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that there were no drugs there to be recovered. Had Jones or someone else intercepted the haul when the vessel was at an American port during its voyage? And if this was not the first consignment to go missing, was someone doing a bit of freelance work, in the USA perhaps? It may be significant that Jones\u2019 passport showed that he had recently returned to the UK from Barbados via Florida.\n\nJames Timothy was charged with conspiring with Peter Macdonald Jones and others to import controlled drugs at Cardiff Docks. He pleaded not guilty at Cardiff Crown Court but was convicted and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. No person was ever charged in connection with the death of Peter Macdonald Jones, the dead frogman of Cardiff Docks."}, {"Prompt Length": 1654, "Output Length": 72, "prompt": "Page 1\n \nPanel 1. \nInterior Movie set.

This product was easy to clean prior to first use. Grinds coffee beans very well but it is very messy. The grinds stick to the cup and when I pour it into my coffee machine fine grinds fall all over the counter and floor. Also, after each use I need to tip the grinder over and tap it so the extra grinds fall onto the counter. The photo shows how much I cleaned up after grinding 8 cups. The video shows what I have to do after I grind coffee each time. It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot but I make 12 cups every night and sometimes 8 cups in the afternoon. Lots of coffee drinkers at my house.If you don\u2019t mind the mess this is a terrific grinder, but I don\u2019t like the mess and waste. \n6 people found this helpful \nFast grinder with static issues! \nBy James Head, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on April 21, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nThe grinder is very fast and quiet so kuddos are worthy there. The problem is when you try and pour the grounds into your filter. The static electricity in the canister is terrible and half of my grinds stick to the sides. When I pour them out, they end up all around my filter area and enter the water reservoir. I can\u2019t recommend this grinder for this reason. It has good qualities ie quietness and speed but the static would stop me here. \n6 people found this helpful \nDesign Flaw \nBy Michael, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on September 21, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nIt's not rocket science, it's a coffee grinder and it does a good job grinding. My issue is with the Coffee Powder Container. You have to literally use your fingernails on both hands to pry the container from the Grinder Body. Not impossible to remove, but requires some effort and you will spill grinds ! To correct, I drilled a hole in the powder container and installed a regular drawer pull knob to aid in pulling out the container. In addition, I removed the Coffee Powder Container Lid and tossed it. Now it's much easier to remove. \n3 people found this helpful \nMakes a huge mess \nBy RMC, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on May 22, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nThis works and it more quiet than the Cuisinart Burr grinder, which I last had. The biggest issue is that this thing makes a huge mess when you pull out the coffee grounds holder after being ground. I mean like everywhere. I plan on modifying the removable lid and that should help out a lot, but we will see. Works great otherwise, but they definitely designed and manufactured before trying it themselves or they probably would have changed up the lid layout so it wouldn't make the mess it does. It's a great grinder besides that, but the mess it makes is simply unacceptable to me at least. \n2 people found this helpful \nAverage quality.

The hopper is light weight plastic and the controls are cheap. The burr grinder itself seems to be good and it grinds beans smoothly.The biggest problem I have with this product is that it is difficult to clean. The ground coffee seems to get trapped between the burr and the receptacle leaving stale coffee behind. \n2 people found this helpful \nUpdate: Great grinder- read the instructions \nBy Kelly, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on November 10, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nUpdate: the more I use it, the messier it is. It works best for just a small batch. I was trying to grind large batches to give away ground coffee as gifts and it was super messy. really like this grinder. I would encourage you to read the instructions first. There are some parts that need to be put together in a very specific way, but it is easy to figure out. It isn\u2019t the easiest one to clean, but I really love the way it grinds the beans. I love the collection bin too. It doesn\u2019t make a mess like so many others.

Even the coarsest setting is still a fine ground. Wish the hopper held an entire bag of beans. Wish it had antistatic as the coffee dust gets on everything. However it's working for what I need for now so I'm keeping it. Update: I do occasionally need to shake the unit to get beans into the grinder. Also, I find the container the holds the grounds an akward shape. It is very hard for me to remove, (I have grip issues) I wish it had a match or handle instead of relying on grasp to remove. \nOne person found this helpful \nHardly Satisfactory for Espresso. \nBy CM, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on October 28, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nIm certain this product is better for your typical coffee grinds, I would not call this acceptable for espresso grinds.As you can see, the grind is nowhere near as fine as it should be, and this is on the finest setting.

I tried medium at first and it came out very fine so my coffee was very strong that day. For the grind to be ok for my pour over I have to use the setting at course. The good side of it is that I get to use less coffee beans, but the not good part of it is that I had to change my normal routine for making it and it took me about 4 days to get it right. :) \nOne person found this helpful \nGood but MESSY \nBy Amazon Customer, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on April 16, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nWe've been grinding coffee for years - decided to upgrade to a conical grinder - maybe they all do this.

Is it a deal breaker? Ya, I'm gonna try another, the mess is just unbelievable \ud83d\ude2d shame because I do like the rest of it, it's compact, quiet and holds a good amount of beans in the reservoir. \nOne person found this helpful \nGrinds ok, but annoying to use \nBy B. Andalora, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on December 23, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nThis is my first burr grinder. I bought it because I got an espresso machine and my blade grinder didn't grind the beans finely enough. The grinder seems no noisier than my blade grinder. It grinds the beans ok. I don't have any problem with static, as some reviewers mentioned.However, my two issues with this grinder are:\\* The beans don't funnel down into the grinder very well. You start the grinder and assume the beans are all ground when it stops. But usually the beans aren't all ground. I have to continuously shake the machine to get all the beans through the grinder. I saw other reviewers also mention this issue.\\* The bigger issue for me is that the hopper the ground coffee goes into is nearly impossible to get off! Both my husband and I have difficulty removing it. I have to use a hard, thin plastic spatula to pry it out. This is so annoying, I might return the grinder. I'll see if it gets any easier over time. \nHopper Design Could Be Better \nBy Desert Rat, Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on December 17, 2022 \nColor: Black \nB099ZKSJPW \nThis was ordered because our Cuisinart was sounding like the years had taken a toll on it. It still ran.The only complaint I had with the Cuisinart was the selector for the amount of coffee it would grind (Timer) was finicky and sometimes required cycling the power to the device in order for it to run.This Sboly has a control that seems to work without issue so far.What I don't like is the hopper that holds the ground coffee. It is rounded and not easy to detach without using fingernails to grab the edges of the hopper.Also coffee seems to collect on all sides like static is holding it and I use a paper funnel to keep grounds from spilling all over as I pour into the coffer filter in it's basket.There is no safety switch to keep it from running with the lower hopper removed.

Recently, teenagers choose to live in the cities rather than their home villages because of school or job opportunities. This essay will discuss multiple reasons behind this trend and explain why the advantages of being in a city do indeed outweigh its drawbacks.\n\nThere are several reasons to desire living in urban areas. Firstly, it gives people an opportunity to study in better schools which cannot be found in rural areas. Since in the modern world education means very much for people\u2019s future, it is crucial to have higher education degrees for those individuals to find well-paid jobs. In addition to that, city life provides people with completely different experiences than their home villages. Thanks to the schools, work or social gathering places, they get to meet a greater number of people from all around the country compared to their rural towns which is crucial for one\u2019s personal development. Lastly, in the cities, not only they get bigger number of job options, but also they can earn larger amount of money. It is very well know that job market is significantly limited in the villages also the current jobs barely pay enough.\n\nIt is clearly seen that benefits of leaving villages outweigh its few number of deficits. It is worth to mention that people face some issues, such as being away from their extended family, more competitive and challenging job market, and substantially more expensive living cost, when they move to the cities. Advantages like learning and exploring new experiences, getting a better education leading to a better paid job and having an interesting career, however, surpass the number of the drawbacks of this development.\n\nTo conclude, there are various reasons for young generation to leave their homes to live in the cities and this movement\u2019s benefits easily outweigh its disadvantages.\n\n] based on this criteria [Band 9\nTask response\nFully addresses all parts of the task\n\nPresents a fully developed position in answer to the question with relevant, fully extended and well supported ideas\n\nCoherence and cohesion\nUses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention\n\nSkilfully manages paragraphing\n\nLexical resource\nUses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features;

It's not enough to just be creative or genuine in your desire to help others.\n\nNo, you need to be good at marketing also.\n\nI'm gonna share one thing with you today that will make that a whole lot easier and help you prosper even if you're not great at sales or marketing or are not a huge fan of the fact you have to do it.\n\nThe Many Benefits of Method-Centric Marketing\nThere's ONE thing you can implement in your business (regardless of experience level) that will make your entire journey far easier.\n\nHere's a list of what having this can do for you and your business:\n\n\u200bMakes you instantly stand out in the sea of noise online, so your message can start consistently attracting paying customers.\n\u200bGreatly reduces any feelings of \"imposter syndrome\" and makes you immediately more confident in sharing your message.\n\u200bPositions you in the eyes of others as a true expert instead of a \"fake guru\" or newbie marketer who can\u2019t be trusted.\n\u200bPre-sells clients on working with you so that you never have to do sales calls or \u201chard sell\u201d ever again if you don\u2019t want to.\n\u200bGives both you and your customers total clarity on how you can provide real results in a unique way worth paying for.\n\u200bAllows you to charge more money for what you do and still have people happy to buy from you instead of the \"competition\"\n\u200bProvides you with the entire curriculum of what you need to teach/share inside both your free and paid content.\n\u200bAutomatically increases the value and conversion rate of ANY offer you create while also making it far easier to sell.\n\u200bMakes your business extremely efficient and also adaptable to your unique personality and creative preferences.\nAll This is Possible With a S.O.U.R.C.E Methodology\nYes, one thing can do all this. It's called your S.O.U.R.C.E Methodology\n\nS.O.U.R.C.E stands for:\n\nSignature Solution\nIt\u2019s what you become known for in your industry and what becomes the primary profit-center of your business.\n\nOne-of-a-Kind Offering\nIt\u2019s what makes your solutions uniquely valuable and what differentiates you from the competition.\n\nUnified Understanding\nIt\u2019s what helps you deepen your understanding of your topic and also streamlines your business growth strategy.\n\nRoadmap to Results\nIt acts as the roadmap that helps both you and your paying clients go from where they are to where they want to be.\n\nCredibility & Confidence\nIt\u2019s what makes you a true expert (without ever having to call yourself one) and helps you overcome imposter syndrome once and for all.\n\nEver-Evolving\nIt grows and evolves as you do, so your business always stays aligned with who you are and adapts to your ever-growing wisdom.\n\nSo what is a SOURCE Methodology exactly?\n\nHere are some examples of what a SOURCE Methodology might end up looking like:\nPremium Shapes (1) jpg\nThink of your SOURCE Methodology like a central database of all your knowledge, organized into a step by step system that informs all your business decisions.\n\nFrom your SOURCE Methodology comes:\n\n\u200bYour social media content ideas\n\u200bYour signature product or service\n\u200bYour entire offer suite\n\u200bYour teaching method\n\u200bYour unique selling proposition\n\u200bYour lead generation and scaling strategy\n\u200bYour roadmap for getting clients results\n\u200bAnd much more\nWhy is it so important to have this in your business?\n\n1. Because SYSTEMIZING your knowledge is how you gracefully SCALE your business and serve more people.\nMost people are stuck trading their time for money. Even entrepreneurs are on the hamster wheel. Only those who are great at creating systems can find ways to escape this.\n\n2. Because OBSCURITY is one of the biggest things holding most people back from the success they desire.\nMost people just aren't that good at getting known and positioning themselves as someone worth following.\n\nHaving your own one-of-a-kind system based on your unique life experience instantly helps you stand out from everyone else so you can start being known as a true expert at something instead of just some random person on the internet trying to grow their side hustle.\n\n3. Because it gives you extreme CLARITY, and clarity leads to more effortless action and momentum.\nYour SOURCE Methodology is the foundation of your business. It's what determines exactly what you post on social media, what you use as lead magnets, what your paid products are, and how you sell them.\n\nIt acts as the roadmap you use to get both yourself and your clients great results. And it's what positions you as the expert in your field.\n\nWithout this one thing, everything in your business will feel more difficult and confusing. With it, you'll have far more clarity and confidence.\n\nHow to Turn Your Methodology Into 1,000 Leads Per Month and a Thriving Digital Product Business\nWith that said, how do we use this to drive real results and achieve the 1,000 leads per month I talked about in the first lesson?\n\nThat's what we'll talk about in the next video.\n\nClick \"Next\" to keep learning.\n\nGo to Next Lesson"}, {"Prompt Length": 1830, "Output Length": 166, "prompt": "is this all ok? \nlibrary(data.table)\n\ndata <- fread('/Users/roberto.ortiz/Documents/ProjectosGrowth/NewProductRappiPlatinum/PRODUCTB/productBData.csv')\n\n#'Cleaning year column\nunique(data$YEAR)\ndata$YEAR <- as.numeric(data$YEAR)\nsort(unique(data$YEAR))\ndata$YEAR[data$YEAR < 1950 | data$YEAR > 2001] <- NA\ndata$YEAR[is.na(data$YEAR)] <- round(mean(data$YEAR, na.rm = TRUE),0)\nhist(data$YEAR)\n\n#'Cleaning income column\nincomeLevels <- c('Prefiero no responder','Actualmente no tengo ingresos',\n 'Menos que 10,000 MXN','De 10,001 hasta 15,000 MXN',\n 'De 15,001 hasta 20,000 MXN','De 20,001 hasta 25,000 MXN',\n 'De 25,001 hasta 30,000 MXN','De 30,001 hasta 35,000 MXN',\n 'De 35,001 hasta 40,000 MXN','De 40,001 hasta 45,000 MXN',\n 'De 45,001 hasta 50,000 MXN','De 50,001 hasta 55,000 MXN',\n 'De 55,001 hasta 60,000 MXN','De 60,001 hasta 65,000 MXN',\n 'De 65,001 hasta 70,000 MXN','M\u00e1s que 70,000 MNX')\ndata$INCOME <- factor(data$INCOME, levels = incomeLevels)\nsummary(data$INCOME)\nggplot(data.frame(data), aes(x=INCOME)) +\n geom\\_bar(color = 'red', fill = 'red') + \n theme(axis.text.x = element\\_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n#'Fixing Credit Cards Column\nunique(data$CREDIT\\_CARDS)\ncreditCardLevels <- c('Ninguna','Solo 1','2 -

Collis goes on to say\nThe Incumbent\u2019s Mistake\nCEOs of established companies often pay too much attention to defining how their firms will capture value and too little to new ways to create value and how firms\u2019 activities and capabilities need to evolve over time. One reason is that approaches focusing on capture (like the five forces) have been very successful in long-established and stable industries and as a result have become ingrained in the strategy process. But CEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking? When did it allow us to become the \u201cdisruptive\u201d innovator?\n\nLook at the list of the most valuable companies in the United States, and you\u2019ll see that discovering and exploiting new business models to satisfy previously unmet, unexpressed, or even unknown customer needs is where the action has been in recent years. Those companies didn\u2019t collectively create trillions of dollars in value by outpositioning their rivals. When they were founded, they didn\u2019t have rivals. Indeed, the kind of businesses they started didn\u2019t exist previously.\n\nWinning with a New Business Model. The most valuable companies in America all launched brand new business models that met previously unfulfilled or unidentified needs. Here are the five largest U.S companies by market cap, as of April 12, 20 21: One: Apple, founded in 1976, now worth 2 point 2 trillion dollars. Two: Microsoft, founded in 1975, now worth 1 point 9 trillion dollars. Three: Amazon, founded in 1994, now worth 1 point 7 trillion dollars. Four: Alphabet, founded in 1998, now worth 1 point 5 trillion dollars. Five: Facebook, founded in 2004, now worth 880 billion dollars. Source: Yahoo Finance\nThe good news for leaders of incumbent companies is that the emergence of new approaches doesn\u2019t have to doom their enterprises. Indeed, if they take a holistic perspective on strategy, they may discover that those business models present attractive opportunities because they create more value.\n\nFor example, would you rather make a onetime sale of a physical product or build a long-term client relationship and deliver tailored solutions that generate more value for the customer and potentially much more profit for you? As some old-line companies have discovered, the latter is the opportunity that new digital business models offer firms that can effectively leverage data and analytics. Komatsu now offers subscriptions to its Smart Construction platform, which coordinates all the activities of a construction site, including drone surveys, dumptruck scheduling, and the operation of autonomous earthmoving equipment. The platform cuts construction projects\u2019 entire costs by well over 15%\u2014creating far more value than the revenue from the sale of bulldozers, which was all that was available in Komatsu\u2019s previous model. In a somewhat similar fashion, Siemens uses artificial intelligence to predict, and so prevent, maintenance issues on its trains. The improvement in uptime performance allows it to switch to performance-based contracts for rail service that bring in thousands of dollars a day, rather than just the initial price of a train.\n\nNo incumbent should respond to every new business model\u2014that would simply be playing whack-a-mole. Instead, a firm must develop a strategic approach to identifying the value-creation potential of models and then determine whether to pursue any new ones by predicting the outcome of competition among alternative models.\n\nBy using available tools, strategists could have foreseen, for example, that video on demand (streaming) would replace Netflix\u2019s original mail-order delivery of DVDs and Blockbuster\u2019s old-fashioned video stores. The superiority of the value proposition for the job to be done for the customer, which was \u201cdelivering personal video entertainment,\u201d suggests the absolute dominance of streaming. An examination of the purchase criteria you might consider\u2014convenience, the ability to make an impulse purchase, access to recent best sellers, a large back catalog\u2014reveals that video on demand serves customers better than either of the earlier business models. If that weren\u2019t enough, the cost of delivering movies and TV shows over the internet is vastly lower than doing so via physical stores or the mail. Considering those advantages, it\u2019s no wonder that almost everyone is now paying monthly subscription fees to streaming services.\n\nWhy Streaming Video Beat Rival Models. Its value proposition was much stronger than the propositions of video stores and DVD-by-mail on almost every dimension, and its costs were far lower. Streaming video excelled on price, convenience, variety of titles, immediate access, availability of best sellers, functionality on multiple devices, variety of media delivered, and ability to connect to other applications and platforms. DVD-by-mail excelled only on variety of titles. Video stores did not excel on any dimension. The cost of delivering a video to a customer was only 25 cents for streaming in 2007, but 1 dollar and 25 cents for DVD-by-mail and 2 dollars and 24 cents for video stores.

Kaufman\nIn contrast, a similar analysis suggests that Amazon\u2019s online business model, which consists of a retail website, a limited number of fulfillment centers, and fleets of delivery trucks, will never fully displace Walmart\u2019s longtime business model, which features traditional brick-and-mortar stores supplied by a national network of distribution centers. When you compare how well each does the job to be done, you see that Amazon\u2019s model is good at providing home delivery for a very broad range (hundreds of millions) of items, while Walmart\u2019s is better for immediate availability at low cost of a more limited number (a few hundred thousand). Each business model has a distinctive proposition that appeals to different customers on different occasions for different products. And a comparison of the cost positions of their asset bases shows that Walmart\u2019s logistics system is low cost for everyday items that consumers pick up in stores in rural or suburban locations, while Amazon\u2019s is more efficient for long-tail items and home delivery in densely populated geographies. Neither business model universally dominates the other. Both will survive, which is why each company is rushing to replicate the other\u2019s asset base, with Amazon buying Whole Foods, and Walmart spending billions of dollars to expand online and add fulfillment centers."}, {"Prompt Length": 1543, "Output Length": 126, "prompt": "![Summary: Today Matters By John C. Maxwell](https://waiyancan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Today-Matters-By-John-C.-Maxwell-705x300.jpg) \n\nNovember 20, 2021 November 20, 2021\n\n#### \\*\\*Today Often Falls to Pieces\\*\\*\\*\\*\u2014 What Is the Missing Piece?\\*\\*\n\nSuccessful people make right decisions early and manage those decisions daily.\n\nThe earlier you make those right decisions and the longer you manage them, the more successful you can become. The people who neglect to make those decisions and to manage them well often look back on their lives with pain and regret\u2014no matter how much talent they possessed or how many opportunities they once had.\n\nI believe that everyone has the power to impact the outcome of his life. The way to do it is to focus on today. Benjamin Franklin rightly observed, \u201cOne today is worth two tomorrows; what I am to be, I am now becoming.\u201d You can make today a good day. In fact, you can make it a masterpiece.\n\n#### \\*\\*Today Can Become a Masterpiece\\*\\*\n\nYou will never change your life until you change something you do daily.\n\nwill never change your life until you change something you do daily. You see, success doesn\u2019t just suddenly occur one day in someone\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds life. For that matter, neither does failure. Each is a process. Every day of your life is merely preparation for the next. What you become is the result of what you do today. In other words . . .\n\n\\*\\*YOU ARE PREPARING FOR SOMETHING\\*\\*\n\nThe way you live your life today is preparing you for your tomorrow. The question is, What are you preparing for? Are you grooming yourself for success or failure?\n\n\u201cYou can pay now and play later, or you can play now and pay later. But either way, you are going to pay.\u201d The idea was that you can play and take it easy and do what you want today, but if you do, your life will be harder later. However, if you work hard now, on the front end, then you will reap rewards in the future.\n\nThe only adequate preparation for tomorrow is the right use of today.\n\nIs it fun to do? Not especially. Often the practice is quite tedious. Does it work? Absolutely.\n\nIt seems obvious to say that good decisions help to create a better tomorrow, yet many people don\u2019t appear to connect their lack of success to their poor decision making. Some people make choices, then experience negative consequences, yet wonder why they can\u2019t seem to get ahead in life. They never figure it out. Others know their choices may not be good for them, but they make them anyway. Such is the case with the alcoholic who keeps drinking excessively or the person who engages in one abusive relationship after another.\n\nNobody says that good decisions are always simple, but they are necessary for success. Theodore Hesburgh, former president of Notre Dame University, admonished:\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re EASY;\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re CHEAP;\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re POPULAR;\n\nYou make decisions because they\u2019re RIGHT.\n\nYou begin to build a better life by determining to make good decisions, but that alone is not enough. You need to know what decisions to make.\n\n1. Attitude: Choose and display the right attitudes daily.\n2. Priorities: Determine and act on important priorities daily.\n4. Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines daily.\n5. Family: Communicate with and care for my family daily.\n6. Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking daily.\n7. Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments daily.\n8. Finances: Make and properly manage dollars daily.\n10. Faith: Deepen and live out my faith daily.\n11. Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships daily.\n12. Generosity: Plan for and model generosity daily.\n13. Values: Embrace and practice good values daily.\n14. Growth: Seek and experience improvements daily.\n\nIf you settle these twelve issues by making the right decision in each area and then manage those decisions daily, you can be successful.\n\n#### \\*\\*Making Today Matter\\*\\*\n\nRate Yourself on the Daily Dozen: Look at the following list of the Daily Dozen and rank how well you do them. Put a \u201c1\u201d beside the one you do the best, a \u201c2\u201d beside the one you\u2019re next best at, and so on until you\u2019ve ranked your skill in them from 1 to 12.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Attitude: Choose and display the right attitudes daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Priorities: Determine and act on important priorities daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Family: Communicate with and care for my family daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Finances: Earn and properly manage finances daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Faith: Deepen and live out my faith daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Generosity: Plan for and model generosity daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Values: Embrace and practice good values daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Growth: Desire and experience improvements daily.\n\nVerify Your Self-evaluation: Talk to a friend who knows you well and ask him or her to confirm how you evaluated yourself. If your friend ranks your strengths and weaknesses differently than you do, discuss your differences of opinion and make adjustments to the rankings as needed.\n\nPick Two Strengths: Pick two strengths from your top six to work on. Make sure that you have made the necessary decision for each area. Then begin practicing the daily disciplines in that area to make it a part of your life. Use the exercises at the end of the chapter to help you if desired.\n\nPick One Weakness: Choose a weakness from your bottom six to work on. Again, make sure you have made the decision for that area and begin practicing the daily disciplines that go with it.\n\nReevaluate: After sixty days have passed, reevaluate yourself in the three areas in which you\u2019ve been working to improve. If you have made significant progress in an area, move on to something new. If an area still needs more work, remain focused on it for another sixty days. But don\u2019t work on more than three areas at a time, and never work on more than one weakness at a time.\n\nRepeat: Keep working on areas until you have the entire Daily Dozen under your belt.\n\nOnce you have made all the key decisions and each of the disciplines has become a habit in your life, then the Daily Dozen will be second nature to you. When these disciplines are woven into the fabric of your life, you will be able to make today your masterpiece. And when you do that, tomorrow will take care of itself.\n\\_\\_\\_\nErstelle 12 Entscheidungen f\u00fcr die man sich t\u00e4glich Entscheiden sollte in folgendem Format:\n- [ ] Heute entscheide ich mich, dass"}, {"Prompt Length": 1261, "Output Length": 74, "prompt": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLookupError Traceback (most recent call last)\n~\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel\\_13632\\2991332326.py in \n 27 \n 28 # Preprocess the text in the train and test DataFrames\n---> 29 train\\_df['text'] = train\\_df['text'].apply(preprocess\\_text)\n 30 test\\_df['text'] = test\\_df['text'].apply(preprocess\\_text)\n 31 \n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\series.py in apply(self, func, convert\\_dtype, args, \\*\\*kwargs)\n 4431 dtype: float64\n 4432 \"\"\"\n-> 4433 return SeriesApply(self, func, convert\\_dtype, args, kwargs).apply()\n 4434 \n 4435 def \\_reduce(\n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\apply.py in apply(self)\n 1086 return self.apply\\_str()\n 1087 \n-> 1088 return self.apply\\_standard()\n 1089 \n 1090 def agg(self):\n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\apply.py in apply\\_standard(self)\n 1141 # List[Union[Callable[..., Any], str]]]]]\"; expected\n 1142 # \"Callable[[Any], Any]\"\n-> 1143 mapped = lib.map\\_infer(\n 1144 values,\n 1145 f, # type: ignore[arg-type]\n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\\\_libs\\lib.pyx in pandas.\\_libs.lib.map\\_infer()\n\n~\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel\\_13632\\2991332326.py in preprocess\\_text(text)\n 20 def preprocess\\_text(text):\n 21 # Tokenize the text\n---> 22 words = nltk.word\\_tokenize(text.lower())\n 23 # Remove stopwords\n 24 words = [word for word in words if word not in stopwords]\n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\nltk\\tokenize\\\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py in word\\_tokenize(text, language, preserve\\_line)\n 127 :type preserve\\_line: bool\n 128 \"\"\"\n--> 129 sentences = [text] if preserve\\_line else sent\\_tokenize(text, language)\n 130 return [\n 131 token for sent in sentences for token in \\_treebank\\_word\\_tokenizer.tokenize(sent)\n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\nltk\\tokenize\\\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py in sent\\_tokenize(text, language)\n 104 :param language: the model name in the Punkt corpus\n 105 \"\"\"\n--> 106 tokenizer = load(f\"tokenizers/punkt/{language}.pickle\")\n 107 return tokenizer.tokenize(text)\n 108 \n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\nltk\\data.py in load(resource\\_url, format, cache, verbose, logic\\_parser, fstruct\\_reader, encoding)\n 748 \n 749 # Load the resource.\n--> 750 opened\\_resource = \\_open(resource\\_url)\n 751 \n 752 if format == \"raw\":\n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\nltk\\data.py in \\_open(resource\\_url)\n 874 \n 875 if protocol is None or protocol.lower() == \"nltk\":\n--> 876 return find(path\\_, path + [\"\"]).open()\n 877 elif protocol.lower() == \"file\":\n 878 # urllib might not use mode='rb', so handle this one ourselves:\n\n~\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\nltk\\data.py in find(resource\\_name, paths)\n 581 sep = \"\\*\" \\* 70\n 582 resource\\_not\\_found = f\"\\n{sep}\\n{msg}\\n{sep}\\n\"\n--> 583 raise LookupError(resource\\_not\\_found)\n 584 \n 585 \n\nLookupError: \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n Resource punkt not found.\n Please use the NLTK Downloader to obtain the resource:\n\n >>> import nltk\n >>> nltk.download('punkt')\n \n For more information see: https://www.nltk.org/data.html\n\n Attempted to load tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle\n\n Searched in:\n - 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rockr/nltk\\_data'\n - 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rockr\\\\Anaconda3\\\\nltk\\_data'\n - 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rockr\\\\Anaconda3\\\\share\\\\nltk\\_data'\n - 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rockr\\\\Anaconda3\\\\lib\\\\nltk\\_data'\n - 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rockr\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\nltk\\_data'\n - 'C:\\\\nltk\\_data'\n - 'D:\\\\nltk\\_data'\n - 'E:\\\\nltk\\_data'\n - ''\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\nplease fix this error"}, {"Prompt Length": 1374, "Output Length": 116, "prompt": "another page to table: Parameter List\n Light\nParameters are options added to a prompt that change how an image generates.

It is spearheaded by the Department of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). In 2015, all 193 United Nations Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \n\nFor Canada, the 2030 Agenda calls for concerted efforts to build an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future, a secure world founded on human rights and the rule of law, free from poverty and hunger. One with full and productive employment and access to quality education and universal health coverage, where gender equality has been achieved, culture and diversity are celebrated, and the environment is protected.\n\nAt the core of the 2030 Agenda are five key elements\u2014people, prosperity, planet, partnership and peace\u2014 all supporting sustainable development that leaves no one behind. Central tenets include:\n\nThe 2030 Agenda is universal in nature and applicable to every country; the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs are as relevant in Canada as everywhere else in the world.\nThe 2030 Agenda is ambitious and aspirational. It acknowledges the requirement to move beyond conventional actions to seek transformative solutions.\nThe SDGs are interlinked and indivisible. The achievement of any goal is linked to the achievement of others.\nThe 2030 Agenda can only be achieved when no one is left behind ensuring that every person can participate in, contribute to and benefit from sustainable development.\n\nSustainable development is defined under the Federal Sustainable Development Act, the legislation that requires the government to prepare and report on the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy every three years.\n\nSustainable development not only ensures the planet's health for future generations, it also includes economic stability and vibrant, healthy communities.\nDefinitions\nsustainability\u2002means the capacity of a thing, action, activity, or process to be maintained indefinitely.\u2002(durabilit\u00e9)\n\nsustainable development\u2002means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u2002(d\u00e9veloppement durabilit\u00e9)\n\nChallenges being addressed\nFour years into the global implementation of the 2030 Agenda, progress has been made with many of the goals and targets. However, it is not proceeding at the pace needed to achieve this ambitious agenda.\n\nCanada is currently experiencing economic growth and historically low unemployment. with a rapidly evolving labour market due to globalization, new technologies, evolving business models and shifting demographics. Amid rapid change, Canada's prosperity and success will increasingly depend on helping all Canadians access decent jobs and on creating a culture of innovation, skills development and lifelong learning.\n\nThe spread of information and communications technology is helping to accelerate human progress. \nAdopting the 2030 Agenda\nCanadians are already answering the call. From businesses acting in socially responsible and environmentally sustainable ways, \u2026.overcome shared challenges and achieve the shared ambitions of the SDGs.\n\nIt is recommended that Canada\u2019s 2030 Agenda National Strategy cover the following:\nLeadership, governance and policy coherence\nworking across different levels of government to create an environment that fosters ownership and collaboration on the SDGs;\nAwareness, engagement and partnership\nraising awareness of the SDGs will include highlighting the efforts of Canadians who are already contributing to the 2030 Agenda\nCanada recognizes that multi-stakeholder partnerships are essential in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda. horizontal collaboration and innovation across sectors that help further implement the 2030 Agenda. This includes partnerships aimed at building awareness and engagement, expanding or establishing new partnerships and networks, and advancing capacity building and research. \nBringing together diverse experts with practical knowledge, experience and insights about approaches that work well enables Canada to enhance problem-solving, innovation and peer learning. These are important implementation tools that can generate new solutions to sustainable development challenges.\nAccountability, transparency and reporting\nReconciliation and the 2030 Agenda\nInvesting in the SDGs\nAchieving sustainable development is key to securing future economic prosperity, ensuring the health of the planet and preserving global peace and security.\nEnhance collaboration between different levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors and research communities, and support the development of new and innovative partnerships, approaches and breakthroughs to advance multiple SDGs.\n\nThe Federal Sustainable Development Strategy\nGoal 2:\nShort-term milestone: Promote and support the Canadian Agricultural Partnership Policy Framework\nConclude the Canadian Agricultural Partnership by 2023 and develop the next Canadian agricultural policy framework.\n\nImplementation strategy action: Support sustainable agriculture\nSupport research, development, knowledge transfer, and adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. Conduct research on the environmental effects of agriculture, as well as ways the sector can help combat climate change and become more economically and environmentally sustainable, including by developing nature-based agricultural climate solutions. Promote innovation and encourage the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, as well as the use of clean fuels and technologies at farm and landscape levels.\nGoal 8: \nTarget: Clean technology commercialization\nBetween 2022 and 2026, 30% of all Sustainable Development Technology Canada's SD Tech Fund-supported technologies are commercialized annually (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry)\nIndicator\nPercentage of SD Tech Fund-supported technologies commercialized (revenue derived from project technology)\nThis indicator tracks the percentage of SD Tech Fund supported technologies commercialized (revenue derived from project technology). As of March 31, 2021, 32% of Sustainable Development Technology Canada's supported technologies have been commercialized. Commercialized projects represent those that have entered or were ready to enter the market, as of March 31 of the given fiscal year.\nGoal 9:\nShort-term milestone: Growing business investment in research and development\nIncrease Canadian business expenditures in research and development to $30 billion by 2025, keeping pace with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average as a percentage of gross domestic product.\nGoal 12:\nShort-term milestone: Measure food loss and waste\nBy 2023, establish a national measurement framework and baseline to identify priority areas of action to reduce food loss and waste.\n\nImplementation strategy action: Deliver efficient food systems\nReduce food loss and waste at all stages of the food supply chain, helping to make our diverse food systems more efficient and more environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.\nGoal 13:\nShort-term milestone: Establish a 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan\nBy the end of March 2022, pursuant to the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, establish Canada's 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan that includes a description of the key measures the Government of Canada intends to take to achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 40 to 45% below 2005 levels."}, {"Prompt Length": 1838, "Output Length": 88, "prompt": "Does my login function below have any lockout functionality?\n\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get\\_user\\_model\nfrom rest\\_framework import permissions, viewsets, filters, status, generics, views\nfrom apps.users.serializers import \\*\nfrom rest\\_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, AllowAny\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.views import TokenObtainPairView, TokenRefreshView\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.exceptions import TokenError, InvalidToken\nfrom rest\\_framework.response import Response\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.contrib.sites.shortcuts import get\\_current\\_site\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core.mail import EmailMessage\nfrom django.utils.http import urlsafe\\_base64\\_encode, urlsafe\\_base64\\_decode\nfrom django.contrib.sites.shortcuts import get\\_current\\_site\nfrom django.urls import reverse\\_lazy\nfrom django.contrib.auth.tokens import PasswordResetTokenGenerator\nfrom django.utils.encoding import force\\_bytes, force\\_str\nfrom .models import Document\nfrom rest\\_framework.parsers import MultiPartParser, FormParser\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseNotFound\nfrom django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied\nfrom apps.help\\_requests.models import HelpRequest\nfrom .permissions import DocumentPermission\nclass UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for viewing user instances\"\"\"\n\n http\\_method\\_names = ['get']\n serializer\\_class = UserSerializer\n permission\\_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)\n\n def get\\_queryset(self):\n if self.request.user.is\\_superuser: # Admin users can see info of every user\n return get\\_user\\_model().objects.all()\n else:\n # Normal users only see information about themselves\n return get\\_user\\_model().objects.filter(pk=self.request.user.id)\nclass RegistrationViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet, TokenObtainPairView):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for registering new users\"\"\"\n serializer\\_class = RegisterSerializer\n permission\\_classes = (AllowAny,)\n http\\_method\\_names = ['post']\n\n def create(self, request, \\*args, \\*\\*kwargs):\n serializer = self.get\\_serializer(data=request.data)\n\n serializer.is\\_valid(raise\\_exception=True)\n user = serializer.save()\n # Create refresh token for user using simplejwt\n refresh = RefreshToken.for\\_user(user)\n res = {\n \"refresh\": str(refresh),\n \"access\": str(refresh.access\\_token),\n }\n\n return Response({\n \"user\": serializer.data,\n \"refresh\": res[\"refresh\"],\n \"token\": res[\"access\"]\n }, status=status.HTTP\\_201\\_CREATED)\nclass LoginViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet, TokenObtainPairView):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for logging in users.

The user interface 400, as provided, may be implemented in the user device 300 as described. In an example, the user interface 400 provides an upload button 402a. A standard document that needs to be templatized is uploaded using the upload button 402a. In other example, an existing template (which may already be stored in a storage arrangement of the system 100) may be imported (via search or the like) to be edited via an edit template button 402b using the proposed framework. Herein, the template may be provided with a desired name using a template name box 404. Thereafter, the document is loaded in a document window 406. It may be appreciated that the contract documents even of the same type may have many fields that may vary from one contract to another, like party name, date of commencement, party address, purpose, jurisdiction, term etc., and thus need to be identified to create a template for the said contract document type. \n[0042] In one embodiment, the fields to be created may be identified in the contact document by manual selection on the loaded document in the document window 406. In such case, a name of each of the manually identified fields is assigned in a fields window 408. Once the fields are created, those may be highlighted in the document. The present user interface 400 with the available fields window 408 may allow to perform the described manual process of identifying fields, which may ultimately be used for creating contract document template, in a user-friendly and intuitive manner, which is not the case with conventionally known contract templatization software and services. \n[0043] In a preferred embodiment, the fields to be created may be identified in the contract document by automatic identification using a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm is based on an NER (named entity recognition) technique. Herein, the user interface 400 may be configured to allow a user to define one or more entities from the displayed text of the contract document in the document window 406; and train a suitable machine learning model to determine entities complementary to the defined entity in the contract document. Specifically, an NER based algorithm is used to extract the entities for the uploaded documents. Some of the entities of interest may include: party1, party2, effective date which are available in the party clause of a contract, contract type, which may, for example, be available in the heading of the document and the term/termination clause of the contract document. \n[0044] In an example, separate models may be created to identify each or a group of these entities by training the corresponding NER models. The NER algorithm is trained by using data with entities in an IOB form (short for inside, outside, beginning), extracted from various documents. The machine learning model may be trained using a variety of models. The process can be iterated multiple times till a desired level of accuracy is achieved. Once the models are trained, tag extraction is carried out on relevant clauses using the inference pipeline. The users can extract information of their interest using this framework. This is an intuitive and quick way for users to be able to extract custom information from text data.\n[0045] Referring to FIG. 5, illustrated is a schematic of a modelling pipeline (as represented by reference numeral 500) for generating an NER model, as per embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown, at step 502, the modelling pipeline 500 involves using a training corpus of various contract documents types (as identified). In the present examples, the training corpus dataset may need a large number of documents, typically more than 600 per entity, in order to deal with data imbalance. At step 504, the modelling pipeline 500 involves using an annotation tool, such as Prodigy, Inception, Docanno, Brat, etc., to come up with IOB labels (which are a format for chunks, and are similar to part-of-speech tags but can denote the inside, outside, and beginning of a chunk) for the used training corpus. At step 506, the modelling pipeline 500 involves generating the NER model using the annotated training corpus by implementing machine learning techniques including, but not limited to, CRFs (conditional random fields), BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM), CNN, ElMo (Embeddings from Language Model), Stanford NLP, or other transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT3), etc., without any limitations. \n[0046] Further, referring to FIG. 6, illustrated is a schematic of an inference pipeline (as represented by reference numeral 600) for implementing the generated NER model (as described in reference to the modelling pipeline 500 of FIG. 5) for entities identification in the contract document being processed (as in the document window 406). Herein, the inference pipeline 600 involves inputting extracted clauses from the contract documents, as may be achieved by a clause classification/extraction model (not described herein for brevity of the present disclosure). The inference pipeline 600 further involves implementing the NER model as described for recognizing entities in the text (as being represented by block 604 in FIG. 6). In the present implementation, the text is pre-processed as per the requirement of the NER model. Herein, an output of the inference pipeline 600 is in the form of extracted entity details from the contract document being processed (as being represented by block 606 in FIG. 6). As may be appreciated, the entity details may include information like parties, term, jurisdiction, effective date, type of the contract document, etc.\n[0047] Subsequently, the identified entities may be defined as fields for the contract document type. As may be understood that each of the identified entities (which may be converted into fields) may have associated properties (field type), like \u201cdate\u201d for effective date, \u201ctext\u201d for party name, \u201cinteger\u201d for amount, etc. Such properties for the various identified entities may be automatically determined, and the corresponding field types may be set as such. Herein, for instance, the properties of the fields (i.e., field types) may be set as of different types like integer, float, date, text, etc. Further, properties of the fields may be set as a dropdown (for standard lists like jurisdictions, country names, etc.), calendar (for dates), etc. All of this may be done in the fields window 408, as previously described in reference to FIG. 4. In the present embodiments, the user interface 400 may be configured to allow for the field types (as created) to be edited, deleted, or modified, if required.\n[0048] Also, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the user interface 400 provides one or more signature and stamp pads boxes 410a, 410b which may allow inserting signatures/stamps in the document at a desired location. Further, the user interface 400 may be configured to allow the insertion of signatures on certain page(s) or all the pages (as required) of the contract document by use of an insert signature button 412. Also, the user interface 400 may be configured to allow the insertion of signatures on certain page(s) or all the pages (as required) of the contract document by use of an insert stamp pad button 414. In some examples, the user interface 400 may also provide a photograph button 416 which can be added and configured as a photo capture field. The user interface 400 may also allow to define a workflow by identifying various steps involved, setting names/emails of people the document flows to, notifications that need to be sent out, etc. by providing a configure workflow button 418. In some examples, the contract document can be set up to include webhooks to manage how a document is created and be shared with other applications, like a contract documents datastore of a same enterprise.\n[0049] It may be appreciated that in all of the above described processes, the clauses in the contact document being processed can be dragged and dropped, re-arranged as required in the document window 406 by the user. Further, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the user interface 400 may allow saving templates (as generated so far) by providing a save template button 420. It may be understood that when the save template button 420 is pushed, the fields identified in the contract document being processed are replaced by an identifiable string in the backend (for example, a party field may be replaced with a string like \u201c#@#Party1#@#\u201d). Now, the created (saved) contract document may be used as a template for generating other contract documents of the same types, as discussed in the proceeding paragraphs. In some examples, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the user interface 400 may further allow users to download a copy of the created contract document template, for reference and perusal of the user, by providing a download template button 422."}, {"Prompt Length": 2969, "Output Length": 167, "prompt": "The transcript continues with:\n[00:14:08.210] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAbsolutely.

It\u2019s like, wait, why, do you mean? Go that level deeper and really tug on those heartstrings and unlock what it is those people have always kind of cared about you. But yeah, I can\u2019t think of another cause that matters more in darker times than those performing arts folks. So my heart goes out to them. And I hope that so many of them will be able to stick around because we need you.\n\n[00:15:19.980] \u2013 Boris\nAbsolutely. I\u2019m a fan, of course, of the arts. But on Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, the arts might not be at the bottom, but they\u2019re on there. They\u2019re self actualization and they are education. They are force for good. I don\u2019t have to sell people, especially those folks in the arts. But I found it honestly a little disheartening how a lot of arts organizations felt about themselves and their work.\n\n[00:15:47.790] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nThat\u2019s the thing.\n\n[00:15:49.150] \u2013 Boris\nThey didn\u2019t know how to speak to their existing base and to try to grow their base during this time of upheaval.\n\n[00:15:58.530] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nThat\u2019s the heartbreaking thing for me. You mentioned the webinar series. We were doing a webinar, probably March or April 2020. One of the attendees chatted in like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just a library foundation. We\u2019re not saving lives.\u201d And I kind of grabbed the microphone from my guest and I said, \u201cNo, my gosh, people need the arts.\u201d They need books, right? I told the story of my kids. We love to go to the library every Saturday morning. It\u2019s one of their favorite activities. We want that to be there when we can finally get back out of the house in a safe way. That\u2019s the situation we find ourselves back in. So that to me is, don\u2019t sell yourself short, right? Because there will be another crisis, like you said, Boris, and you will not only matter, but you may even be more critical, especially to the people that already care and hold that cause near and dear to your heart. So I hope people find this encouraging. That\u2019s kind of how I think you mean it, too. And I definitely mean it because there will be something else that happens.\n\n[00:17:00.710] \u2013 Boris\nSo we teased since the beginning of the episode, we teased that we\u2019ve got data that we\u2019ve got data on what\u2019s going on, what was working, what wasn\u2019t working. And I personally want to hear it because I haven\u2019t gotten it yet. And I\u2019ve read some of the reports out there. But talk to me, Steven. What happened during the pandemic, what\u2019s going on now and what\u2019s not working?\n\n[00:17:24.940] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nWell, aside from asking and not putting ourselves on the sidelines, that was definitely a big one. But we also looked at those folks that were doing well and maybe even doing better than in past years. A couple of things stood out. The prevalence of phone calls. So we\u2019re a donor database so we can see what kind of interactions people are making with their donors and in what format. And we saw phone calls not only shoot up, probably because we couldn\u2019t do events and maybe even direct mail was harder, but not only were more phone calls being made to supporters, but we could really see that they were moving the needle on things like revenue and donor retention and things like that.\n\n[00:18:09.700] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAnd I think it\u2019s because especially in 2020, we were isolated. We were social distanced. That phone call from a nonprofit to a supporter, that may have been one of the only few personal interactions that they encountered and probably the only one from a brand, right? From someone who wasn\u2019t a friend or a family member or a co-worker. That not only made a big difference in 2020, but again, it continued to have efficacy through 2021. And I think for all the reasons I just said, but also because it\u2019s so surprising to get a phone call that\u2019s a pure thank you or is showing curiosity about why you support. And I sound kind of cynical and I hate to be surprised, but that\u2019s kind of rare, right? I can count on maybe one hand how many times that\u2019s happened to me from a nonprofit or anything that I\u2019ve supported.\n\n[00:19:04.490] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nPersonal emails, same thing. So there\u2019s mass emails where you set up an email blast to all the people in your database, all 2000 of them or whatever. We also saw people reaching out individually, you know, me literally opening up Gmail, writing an email to Boris, like, \u201cHey, Boris, thanks for having me on the show. You\u2019re awesome. Let\u2019s stay in touch.\u201d The same thing not only increased, but also did have an effect on that year over year kind of revenue increases. So the last two years were this kind of re-emergence, at least from our view, of truly personal outreach. And again, what better time? And maybe that\u2019s what spurred it on, because we couldn\u2019t do things like events or in-person interactions or things like that. So that was the only alternative. But I think it opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes to like, wow, maybe we should make this a normal thing that we do during any kind of climate or crisis, if there is one, because people give to people, right? And fundraising is very relationship driven, you know, this.\n\n[00:20:10.550] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nBut I feel like because of all this technology available to us, maybe those kind of analog or one to one or old school formats or mediums have kind of gone by the wayside but did come back because of pure necessity, right? Because that\u2019s all there was out there. And I hope that that sticks around because there\u2019s always been evidence that those things are impactful. But we really saw those things be even more impactful over the last two years. So another thing that I\u2019ve been shouting from the rooftop: reach out to people, because it is very personal.\n\n[00:20:45.410] \u2013 Boris\nSo there was a lot of great stuff in there that I want to touch on and really highlight. And I\u2019m really glad that you said people give to people because earlier you had said nonprofits reaching out to individuals. It\u2019s not nonprofits that are on the phone. You\u2019re a person at your nonprofit. And you said how many brands do that. I don\u2019t remember any time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m wearing a Banana Republic sweater; Banana Republic has never called me and asked, \u201cHey, Boris, how are you doing with this pandemic or with this crisis in Ukraine?\n\n[00:21:19.560] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nRight. It would be weird.\n\n[00:21:21.260] \u2013 Boris\nYeah, exactly. It would be weird. It might be interesting, but they don\u2019t care. They care. \u201cHey, Boris, here\u2019s a coupon, maybe come back and spend some more money.\u201d\n\n[00:21:30.560] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nGet the matching tie.\n\n[00:21:31.940] \u2013 Boris\nYeah, exactly.\n\n[00:21:33.240] \u2013 Boris\nWhereas a nonprofit does care, hopefully does care about its constituents, about its supporters, certainly about its clients, has things to say and has questions to ask. You\u2019ve got to ask, you\u2019ve got to be curious. Not just, \u201cHey, why do you support us,\u201d but also \u201chow are you doing?\u201d Reinforce that connection.\n\n[00:21:53.100] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAnd I would imagine that was the question behind a lot of that outreach, either by phone or by email. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, Boris, you\u2019re a monthly donor. We want to say thanks, but also wanted to say, are you okay? This is a tough time. We just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d And you\u2019re right. Like buying a shirt is not personal, but donating to a cancer charity because your grandmother passed away from that form of cancer, that\u2019s very personal. So to be able to reach back out, acknowledge it, yeah, but learn that information. I love the word you used, showing curiosity. I think that\u2019s something that we definitely suffer from as a fundraising sector is, why do these people support us? And there is most often than not a story behind that, maybe not as much as during times of crisis where you\u2019re kind of driven by that urgent need and not necessarily care about that cause. And I know you and Tim talked about that, and that kind of giving definitely does happen. But a lot of the gifts, there\u2019s probably a very personal reason behind it. If that can be the conversation starter, that\u2019s a pretty darn powerful conversation.\n\n[00:23:02.030] \u2013 Boris\nSo I do want to ask, though, you mentioned in your CRM you might have 2000 folks on your list. I don\u2019t know which organization has the bandwidth to personally call 2000 people. How do you navigate that? It seems almost cold to prioritize certain people over others. Is there a strategy that you recommend that you\u2019ve seen work or think is a good way to go?\n\n[00:23:28.410] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nYeah, I\u2019m glad you asked, because it\u2019s hard. And there\u2019s tons of people like me who are saying, like, you\u2019re not doing enough, and here are 20 things you should be doing. And I get it. It\u2019s hard. And if you\u2019ve got that big data set, I think there are a couple of low hanging fruit. I mentioned first-time donors. That\u2019s one where we have the data and we\u2019ll share and we can link it in the show notes, I suppose. But the phone calls really work. They really do seem to have an effect on not just retention rates, but the speed in which you received a second gift. That window really shortens if they\u2019ve been called and they tend to give more. And I think it comes down again to curiosity, right? So you call them. \u201cHey, Boris, thanks so much for your first gift. Happy to have you join our community of donors. By the way, why did you give? What spurred that gift today?\u201d And if you can learn or get that story, that will help you subsequently communicate to them, right? And sort of contextualize that reason for giving.\n\n[00:24:30.620] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nSo I love first-time donors as a priority. If you get a phone number, and you\u2019re not always going to have a phone number and I don\u2019t recommend you go out and try to find their phone number, like call their employer, that would be a little weird. But if you got a first-time gift and they gave you a phone number, if maybe it was not required on the form or they offered it up somehow, that\u2019s almost an invitation. So that\u2019s probably going to take that list of 2000 down to under ten because it may not happen very often. And maybe that\u2019s doable in an hour or so on a Friday afternoon, call those people, say thanks, welcome them, maybe find out a little bit about that motivation. Monthly donors, that\u2019s one that maybe flies a little under the radar because it\u2019s happening automatically. Maybe the dollar amounts are small; $5 a month doesn\u2019t seem like that much. Although over the lifetime, that\u2019s a pretty significant lifetime value. \u201cHey, Boris, thanks for being a monthly donor. You\u2019re keeping the lights on. Just want to say thanks, check in with you, make sure you\u2019re doing okay. How\u2019s the family?\u201d Whatever it is, that kind of outreach.\n\n[00:25:37.550] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nWhat are those segments? Get out the whiteboard and write down like, who are those people? First-time donors, monthly donors, lapsed donors. People who have been giving for a long time. Everybody will probably have those. But depending on your cause type, volunteers, alumni, former service recipients, people who have adopted animals from us, who are those types of people? And then you can kind of decide, okay, what do we want to say to these people? Can we automate some of these things? Should we ask for different things from these people? Go through that exercise and identify it."}, {"Prompt Length": 2214, "Output Length": 176, "prompt": "Write the code matching the following information\n1 Introduction\nIn this assignment, we are going to implement a chat program using UDP Layer 4 protocol talking\nacross an unreliable channel. The assignment will cover socket programming. You will use C or C++\nto implement it although C is recommended.\nBefore starting the implementation, please read Section 3.4 \u2013 Principles of Reliable Data Transfer from Kurose & Ross to cover the theory. For the practice, you can read Beej\u2019s Guide to Network\nProgramming (Using Internet Sockets). Finally, to understand the big picture regarding the reliable data transfer, you can check out the interactive material on the Kurose & Ross website and\nthis animation.\nYou can discuss the homework and ask your questions on the discussion forum thread on our\nODTUClass page. I am also available at yigit@ceng.metu.edu.tr.\n2 Setup\nPlease follow the instructions given in this section thoroughly to set up your homework environment.\nWe will use an Ubuntu Vagrant box as the host machine and create two network containers in\nit. By adjusting the parameters of the interfaces (at both ends) between the client and the server,\nwe will have a seamless and native unreliable channel without relying on any external programs.\nRun the following commands on an empty folder. If you follow along, you can code on your\nhost machine which is synced with the Vagrant box, so you can compile and run your client and\nserver on there.\n(host) vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64 # create a new ubuntu 22.04 box\n# Places a Vagrantfile on the empty directory\n# We will develop alongside it\n(host) mkdir code\nNow we have a directory with a Vagrantfile and the code directory inside. We can edit the\nVagrantfile to have the code directory synced inside the Vagrant box.\n1\n# -\\*- mode: ruby -\\*-\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\n# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The \"2\" in Vagrant.configure\n# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for\n# backwards compatibility).

If you are curious about\nthe process please refer to that tutorial, but understanding it is not necessary to complete this\nhomework.\nYou can also follow the steps on this screencast to see what should be happening at each step.\nAt the end of the screencast I demonstrate the nc binary as a makeshift server-client chat program.\nYour binaries will have a similar behavior.\nYou should run your client binary at the client container and the server binary at the server\ncontainer.\n2.1 Manipulating Traffic\nAll this setup for containers would be quite pointless sans this step. Here, we will write netem\n(Network Emulator) rules using tc to make the connection between the server and the client a lot\nworse. This section was prepared according to the lab manual from Jed Crandall\u2019s course. You\ncan refer to that document for a complete picture.\nThe following tc/netem rules are the worst case you will have to deal with. You should run\nthe rules twice inside each container, one for each interface.\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 50ms loss 25% 10% duplicate 25% reorder 25% 50%\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 50ms loss 25% 10% duplicate 25% reorder 25% 50%\nWhile developing, you might want to start with a good channel between the client and the\nserver, and degrade it as you complete the requirements. If you would like to follow that route,\nyou should first start with;\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 10ms\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc add dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 10ms\nAnd then change the tc rules gradually.\n# on the server, for the server\u2019s interface, note the change rather than add\ntc qdisc change dev ceth0 root netem delay 100ms 10ms loss 20%\n# on the client, for the client\u2019s interface\ntc qdisc change dev ceth1 root netem delay 100ms 10ms loss 20%\nThe following are useful as well;\n# see the current rules in effect\ntc qdisc show\n# deleting a rule using change is cumbersome\n# delete alltogether and start from scratch\n# mind the interface\ntc qdisc del dev ceth0 root\n3\n3 Implementation\nWe are implementing a chat scenario on the command line. Your implementation will output two\nbinaries: a client and a server. The client and the server will only talk to each other, and there\nwill be two participants in the chat. The messages will end with a newline character, so every\nmessage is a single line. A client-server architecture is ideal for this task. However, there are some\nconstraints.\nThe network we are on is particularly bad, the packets might be reordered, dropped, delayed\nor even duplicated. As an additional constraint, the payload of any packet you send can have at\nmost 16 bytes. This does include the sequence number or any other metadata you might use to\ndeliver the packet.\nThe scenario would have been trivial if we were allowed to use SOCK STREAM \u2013 kernel\u2019s TCP\nimplementation. It would take care of the reliable transfer for us. However, we are only allowed to\nuse SOCK DGRAM, to send packets using UDP. You can read more at $ man 2 socket on any Linux\nmachine.\nYou are recommended to start with the interface given in the Section 3.4 of the Kurose & Ross\nbook. We are going to implement the Go-Back-N protocol, described in the textbook.\nTo ensure reliable transfer on the unreliable channel, you need to implement ACK packets to\nmake sure the other side got your packet right, and a timer mechanism for every packet you sent\nso that lost packets can trigger a timeout.\nThe server starts listening on a socket and the client initiates the connection. Then, both\nprograms accept user input from the standard input and send the message to the other side. Any\ninput (on both server and client) will be sent to the other endpoint using reliable data transfer, on\nUDP packets. The receiving party should see the messages in the same order as they were written\nby the sending party, with duplicates silently ignored.\nIdeally, threading should be used to listen and send at the same time. This is especially\nimportant for receiving ACK packets and data packets concurrently, on both endpoints.\nTo terminate the connection, at any time but not as the first input/message, either server\u2019s\nuser or the client\u2019s user can enter three consecutive newline characters on stdin (two empty lines).\nThis will initiate the shutdown & teardown sequence for both the client and the server. Assume\nthe user sitting on the client input two empty lines. The client sends the shutdown request to\nthe server, still following the reliable transfer protocol. However, no more input from stdin will\nbe accepted (e.g. they will be ignored) nor any remaining messages from server will be displayed.\nWhen the server receives the shutdown request, it will also ignore the remaining messages in transit\nand ignore its stdin. When either endpoint complete the shutdown process (either through ACKs\nor sufficient timeouts), they can gracefully exit. The process mirrors for the server as well."}, {"Prompt Length": 2250, "Output Length": 148, "prompt": "Ok, now, I am showing you the form looks like:\n\nr\nUSCIS\nUse\nOnly\nPetition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\nUSCIS\nForm I-129\nOMB No. 1615-0009\nExpires 11/30/2025\nClassification Approved\nConsulate/POE/PFI Notified\nExtension Granted\nCOS/Extension Granted\nReceipt Partial Approval (explain) Action Block\nClass:\nNo. of Workers:\nJob Code:\nValidity Dates:\nFrom:\nTo:\nAt:\nLegal Name of Individual Petitioner\nIf you are an individual filing this petition, complete Item Number 1.

Rather than\nincreasing demand for Merck\u2019s products, the company\u2019s\ninvestments are designed to support technologies that\ncould enhance its profitability by streamlining the way it\ndoes business. For example, Merck has invested in start-up\ncompanies developing ways to cut the time required to re-\ncruit appropriate patients for clinical trials of new drugs.\nMerck\u2019s relationship with the start-ups is that of an in-\nvestor and a customer. But if these ventures succeed,\nMerck will be able to use their methods to move its drugs\nmore rapidly through the clinical trials necessary to ob-\ntain FDA approval, leaving it more time to market a drug\nbefore its patent expires. The company estimates that\nspeeding up the patient recruitment process could ulti-\nmately add millions of dollars per month to Merck\u2019s bot-\ntom line. Again, Merck need not enjoy a high financial\nreturn on these investments to realize their strategic\nbenefits.\nBut enabling investments have their limits, too. These\nvehicles will be justified only if they can capture a sub-\nstantial portion of the market growth they stimulate.\nWhen Intel grows its ecosystem, it is also growing the mar-\nket for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices. Because\nIntel\u2019s market position is strong, it can expect to realize\nmost of the increased demand in the market. Intel\u2019s\nsmaller rival AMD, by contrast, could not afford to create\ndemand in a similar fashion because it would not capture\nenough of the increase to justify its investments.\nEmergent Investments. A company makes these\nkinds of investments in start-ups that have tight links to\nits operating capabilities but that offer little to enhance its\ncurrent strategy. Nevertheless, if the business environ-\nment shifts or if a company\u2019s strategy changes, such a new\nventure might suddenly become strategically valuable.\nThis gives it an optionlike strategic upside beyond what-\never financial returns it generates. For example, a com-\npany may sense an opportunity in a strategic \u201cwhite-\nspace\u201d \u2013 a new market with a new set of customers.\nExploring the potential of such a market is often difficult\nfor a company focused on serving its current market.\nInvesting in a start-up willing and able to enter this eal customers \u2013 provides information that\ncould never be gleaned from the hypothetical\nquestions of a market research survey. If the\nmarket seems to hold potential, the investing\ncompany may choose to shift its course.\nThus, while the immediate benefits, if any,\nof such investments are financial, the ultimate\nreturn may result from exercising the strategic\noption. In that sense, emergent investments\ncomplement the benefits of driving invest-\nments, which are designed only to further the\ncompany\u2019s current strategy.\nA strong operational link between a com-\npany and its start-up can take various forms.\nIt may mean sharing technology, as with the\nstart-ups spun off from Lucent Technologies.\n(See the sidebar \u201cLucent Hedges Its Bets.\u201d)\nLucent also sometimes shares production\nfacilities and sales channels with the newly\nindependent ventures, improving the effi-\nciency of its own production and distribution\noperations by allowing them to run at a\nhigher capacity.\nOr the links might take the form of product\nuse. In 1997, Intel invested in a start-up called\nBerkeley Networks. Berkeley used existing\nIntel processors to make low-cost switches\nand routers for communications networks \u2013\na new market for Intel products. At the time,\nIntel was happy to see its products used in this\nrather novel way. But with little likelihood\nthat Berkeley\u2019s business would create much\nincremental demand for its products and\nno other apparent strategic upside for itself,\nIntel saw the investment as primarily a finan-\ncial one.\nAs Intel performed its due diligence on its\ninvestment, though, it began to see the out-\nlines of a possible strategy shift, one that\nmight result in the widespread use of its products in net-\nwork switches. Initially, this view was controversial within\nthe company: At the time, Intel\u2019s communications busi-\nness was focused on making products (for example, net-\nwork interface cards for PC networks) that were compat-\nible with the prevailing Ethernet network standard. Since\nthe Berkeley approach competed with the Ethernet stan-\ndard, Intel had to balance the benefits of promoting a\nnew network architecture that used Intel\u2019s core Pentium\nproducts against the threat that the Berkeley-inspired ar-\nchitecture posed to Ethernet networks. After some sharp\ninternal disagreements \u2013 and after the value of Berkeley\nNetworks began to grow \u2013 Intel decided to adapt its strat-\negy to pursue this opportunity, culminating in the Intel\nInternet Exchange Architecture, launched in 1999. The investment in Berkeley Networks helped Intel identify a\npromising opportunity more quickly than it might have\notherwise.\nOf course, many options never become valuable, and\nmany emergent investments will never be important\nto an organization\u2019s strategy. It is important to let these\noptions lapse and settle for whatever financial returns\nhave been earned. Thus, managing these investments\nrequires balancing financial discipline with strategic\npotential. Many companies err by throwing good money\nafter bad. Partnering with private VC funds, and follow-\ning their lead, is one way to impose financial discipline\non the process.\nPassive Investments. In this mode of VC investment,\nthe ventures are not connected to the corporation\u2019s own\nstrategy and are only loosely linked to the corporation\u2019s\noperational capabilities. Consequently, the corporation\nlacks the means to actively advance its own business\nthrough these investments. And despite the perception of\nsome companies that they enjoy technology or market\nknowledge that gives them advantages over other in-\nvestors, the recent flight of corporate VC suggests other-\nwise. Thus, in passive venturing, a corporation is just an-\nother investor subject to the vagaries of financial returns\nin the private equity market. Indeed, this type of investing\nis arguably a misuse of shareholders\u2019 funds. (For a fuller\ndiscussion, see the sidebar \u201cThe Corporation as Money\nManager.\u201d)\nFor example, Dell Ventures poured money into ven-\ntures that had only tangential connections with Dell\u2019s\nown strategy. Yes, these ventures would have increased\ndemand for personal computers and servers if they had\nsucceeded, but Dell\u2019s market share was not high enough\nto allow it to capture much of the gain from that in-\ncreased demand. When the value of its investments col-\nlapsed last year, no potential strategic benefit remained \u2013\nas would have been the case with an emergent invest-\nment \u2013 to compensate for the financial losses."}, {"Prompt Length": 3166, "Output Length": 86, "prompt": "Part 4 (acknowledge and await part 5 and any other parts):\n\nTrenton (Trenton Journal)\n\nThe second community for which we assessed information needs was Trenton. The survey was distributed by Miles, owner of The Trenton Journal, to people in his network, including the nonprofit community foundation for which he also works, as well as prominent churches. Miles also posted a link to the survey in his newsletter and on his website. As in Paterson, we also created a printed flyer with the survey link and a QR code. Because of the financial incentive, we had a number of false responses by bots or people trying to game the drawing, which we also saw in Paterson. The final N, after cleaning, was 119 (recall that all questions were optional, so the numbers reported below often do not add up to 119).\n\nThe survey respondents were distributed evenly among the four wards of Trenton; this suggests that Trenton Journal\u2019s coverage of the four wards should be roughly equal. \n\nTable 1: Where survey respondents live\nEast Ward \nNorth Ward\nSouth Ward\nWest Ward\n21\n25\n23\n22\nThe graphic below shows how long the respondents have lived in Trenton. There is marked variation here depending on the ward; in the West, South and North wards, more than 65% of residents have lived there for at least six years, while in the south ward more than 55% of residents have been there for at least 11 years, showing depth of connection to the community. The East ward is the most evenly distributed and has the greatest percentage of residents who have been there for less than a year; notably, all of the respondents from the North ward have lived there for at least a year. The focus group respondents also tended to be people who have lived in the city for a decade or longer (we did not differentiate their answers by ward).\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nIn general, the respondents who live in Trenton\u2019s South Ward stood out as having different experiences and opinions in many cases, compared to residents of other wards. Perhaps surprisingly, given how long people have lived in the area, they were much more likely to say their community is a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d place to live (43%). For comparison, only 23% of the East Ward, 19% of the West Ward, and 20% of the North Ward residents said the same (see graphic below). Because of this and other marked differences, the responses of South Ward residents were considered separately for the analysis.\n\nRespondents from the West ward were generally happiest with their community\u2019s quality of life, with more than half stating that Trenton is a good or excellent place to live, followed by respondents from the East and North wards, where roughly half think the same. By contrast, nearly half of respondents from the South ward said Trenton is a poor or terrible place to live, and the fewest calling it a fair place to live, showing the strongest division of opinion on the question. \n\nWe asked people to describe the community in one sentence. Some of the responses were negative:\n\nThere are a lot of empty houses in my neighborhood.\nLack of police presence.\nLots of crime and gangs.\n\nBut others struck a balanced and nuanced view of the strengths and challenges:\nEclectic mix of good and bad.\nTrenton should be so much nicer than it is, but it is well located and there is lots in the surrounding area that is wonderful.\nA good community where good people and good news is lost in the bad press and violence by a few in the community.\nYou can see the beauty within the struggle.\nIt depends where you live in the community.\n\nPeople in both focus groups acknowledged problems with the area \u2013 lack of repairs to facilities and problems accessing public information came up several times \u2013 but also emphasized the many positive sides of Trenton and of the people who live there. They wanted to hear more about these positive stories and have easier access to public information to fix the things that are wrong; these comments informed the recommendations that we made to the publisher (listed below).\n\nWhat are Trenton\u2019s information needs?\n\nAbout 6 in 10 survey respondents said it is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important\u201d to keep up with local news. Meanwhile, 40% said it is harder today to keep up with local news compared to three years ago. Only 23% said it was easier. The focus group participants reported following news at the national, state and local levels, usually through mass media such as cable news networks or the evening news. Both survey and focus group participants said they would be excited about a local news source that filled the existing information gaps in Trenton. \n\nSatisfaction/concern\n\nOne survey question asked whether each topic is a significant source of either satisfaction or concern in the community. On many topics, the respondents from Trenton disagreed. The most polarizing issue was crime and safety: 33% feel crime is high and they are unsafe there, while 46% of people think the opposite. \n\nThere were four topics where at least 15% of the people strongly agreed but another at least 15% strongly disagreed:\nCrime is low/high.\nEntertainment options are good/bad.\nJobs are satisfactory/unsatisfactory.\nThe environment is clean/unclean.\n\nAdditionally, local government and politics was the issue most people had an opinion about. Only 10% said this was not important to them. Fifty percent agreed that local officials are effective and trustworthy, while 33% disagreed. The responses to these topic-based questions suggested to us that the Journal will want to be even-handed in its coverage, especially of these divisive local topics.\n\nSome topics, however, evoked agreement:\nThe community\u2019s history. A total of 32% strongly agreed and 60% at least somewhat agreed that Trenton has history and traditions to be proud of.\nSports. A total of 58% agreed that local sports are fun and exciting to follow, while only 21% disagreed.\nSocial issues. A total of 56% agreed that the community shares their values on issues like race, immigration, and abortion.\n\nAnother survey question asked, \u201cHow important is it for you personally to read the following types of information in the Trenton Journal?\u201d\n\nRespondents said the most important topics of coverage were crime, sports, health care, and local government. There were large groups who were \u201csomewhat\u201d interested in other topics: entertainment options, local history and traditions, and local arts and culture. Twenty-six percent said that family life is \u201cextremely important\u201d to them.\nHow people use and access local news\n\nTo better understand The Trenton Journal community\u2019s information needs and the motivations that drive them to seek out local news, we asked them to name the most important reasons they follow local news. The top response was \u201cto stay informed and be a better citizen\u201d (37%). \n\nAfter that nearly a third of respondents said they use local news for entertainment, hobbies, and sports (33%), or to \u201cfind places to go and things to do\u201d (30%). Twenty-eight percent said local news helped them in their job and 26% said it helped them stay safe and avoid crime. These answers point to the importance of \u201cservice journalism,\u201d a simple but extremely practical and helpful practice.\n\nThere were a few most-common ways that survey respondents discover local news in Trenton. Each of these is used every day by 3 in 10 survey respondents, and at least weekly by 50 to 60% of them:\nFrom friends / family.\nGoogle searches.\nReading Facebook News Feed.\nReading Facebook Groups.\n\nFacebook is a major factor in the local news ecosystem of the survey respondents. Nearly 8 in 10 are getting local news and information there regularly. Half use Facebook for news at least once a week. Notably, the everyday news engagement is slightly stronger for Facebook Groups than for Facebook News Feed.\n\nFrequency of use for news\nFacebook News Feed\nFacebook Group\nEvery day\n23%\n28%\nWeekly or more\n55%\n51%\nA few times a month or more\n78%\n67%\nSeparately, we asked people how satisfied they are with various local news sources, including some Facebook Groups. The Facebook Groups ranked higher in satisfaction than any other news source. For example the Group named \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d rated highly, with 25% saying they \u201clove it and use it all the time\u201d and a total of 60% saying they at least \u201cfind it useful and use it sometimes.\u201d Another 18% \u201cdon\u2019t love it, but \u201cuse it when I have to.\u201d Only 10% avoid it and 12% never heard of or used it. The Group named \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton\u201d was more polarizing: 28% \u201clove it\u201d and 16% \u201cdislike\u201d it. Nonetheless, 50% of respondents find it useful sometimes and 65% at least use it when they have to. Focus group participants also reported accessing local news via Facebook, as well as from family/friends and from local television news, in particular on News 12 New Jersey.\n\nOther social networks are used by a smaller number of respondents, suggesting either that the Journal should be cautious about devoting too many scarce resources to other platforms or that the survey and focus groups did not reach community members who use these for local news and information.\n\nSocial network\nPercent using daily\nPercent using 1-2 times a week or more\nInstagram\n19%\n43%\nTwitter\n12%\n37%\nTikTok\n14%\n31%\n\nMeanwhile, about 45% of survey respondents use Trenton Journal social media accounts at least weekly, and 68% visit at least a few times a month. The other newspapers we asked about \u2014 The Trentonian, Trenton Daily, and The Times of Trenton \u2014 ranked lower in satisfaction; these may be secondary sources for some of the Journal\u2019s readers.\nWe also asked survey respondents to name any sources that they \u201ctrust the most for useful, reliable local news and information.\u201d There were a few individual responses to that question that might suggest nontraditional sources with whom the Journal may want to build relationships:\nLuz Esperanza y Vida organization.\nEast Trenton committee.\nTrenton Waves podcast.\nStreet ministries.\nThe Old Mill Hill Society.\n\nWhat people think of Trenton Journal\n\nRespondents generally enjoy Trenton Journal\u2019s content on social media: 21% \u201clove\u201d Trenton Journal social media and use it all the time. Another 41% (the most common answer) say Trenton Journal\u2019s social media is \u201cuseful and use it sometimes.\u201d Only 12% dislike its social accounts, and 12% haven\u2019t heard of them yet. Opinions were stronger among residents of the South Ward. They have a more favorable opinion of Trent Journal\u2019s social media accounts (32% \u201clove it\u201d, another 45% say \u201cuseful sometimes\u201d), and they rated Trenton Journal\u2019s social media accounts as more satisfying than any other local news source. \n\nTrenton Journal\u2019s website and emails were a bit less popular than their social media; still, a majority do find them useful. The website or emails are used by 47% at least weekly and at least 61% visit at least a few times a month. These somewhat contradictory findings should be explored in follow-up conversations with community members or further research.\n\nReader opinion\nTrenton Journal\u2019s \nsocial media accounts\nTrenton Journal\u2019s\n website and emails\n\u201cLove it, use it all the time\u201d\n21%\n19%\n\u201cI find it useful and use it sometimes\u201d\n41%\n39%\n\u201cI dislike it and avoid using it\u201d\n12%\n18%\nNever heard or it or used it\n12%\n9%\n\nWe asked the people familiar with Trenton Journal how well it does certain things. At least 60% of people think it does these things at least \u201cfairly well\u201d:\nIs fair to all sides.\nIs neutral and doesn't take positions on issues.\nActs as a watchdog of powerful institutions and people.\nMakes the news entertaining.\nProvides diverse points of view.\nMakes it easier to find important civic information.\nHelps people understand communities unlike their own.\nVerifies and gets the facts right.\n\nSlightly fewer people, about 55%, think it does these things at least fairly well:\nProvides forums for community discussions,\nReports on possible solutions to problems in society,\n\nAt the same time, a sizeable minority (about 40% of people) thought the Trenton Journal did those things poorly, so there is room to improve. \n\nAs part of the research design, we devised several recommendations for each publisher based on analysis of the data from the survey and focus groups. The recommendations we presented to the Trenton Journal are below, based on both our discussions with the publishers and the analysis above.\n\nRecommendations given to the Trenton Journal\n\nCreate a dedicated section for posting the dates and times of upcoming municipal meetings, similar to your events page; publicize it via your newsletter and social media.\nGo one step further and cover municipal meetings regularly, even if it\u2019s simply by providing a transcript.\nConsider adding a section on your website that lists all city and state departments, the services they provide, and their contact information.\nConsider offering different sub-pages for each ward, that can be tailored to the differing concerns and interest in each.\nEngage to a greater extent on Facebook, and be present on Facebook groups that are relevant in Trenton, especially \u201cTrenton Orbit\u201d and \u201cPeterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton.\u201d\nBased on our recommendations, and given the available resources, Trenton Journal decided to make the following changes:\n\nIncrease coverage of municipal meetings, the education system, and crime and safety.\n\nCreate a tab on the website\u2019s resource page to house publicly available data about the city.\n\nCreate an online directory of public officials and other power-holders in the city; increase coverage of them through profiles and interviews.\n\nAfter the proposed changes had begun to be implemented, we sent a follow-up survey to the people who had filled out the survey or participated in one of the focus groups, asking them how often they visited Trenton Journal\u2019s website, how they felt about each of these changes, and for any other open-ended feedback they might provide. For each of the changes, we asked whether they agreed or disagreed with this change, and if they disagreed, what they\u2019d like to see done instead. Again the sample was disappointingly small (N=9), but generally positive.\n\nFour of the nine reported visiting the website daily, while three said they visit a few times a week and one said rarely. Perhaps not surprisingly (since the changes were based on community feedback), there was overwhelming agreement with the changes that Trenton Journal is making. However when there was disagreement there was valuable feedback, such as the suggestion to focus on neighborhoods rather than the education system, or to provide data about the percentage of rentals to ownership and information about rental building ownership as part of the publicly available data. One open-ended response stated, \u201cI love the idea of covering municipal government and the people that are associated with it.\u201d"}, {"Prompt Length": 1207, "Output Length": 64, "prompt": "Petar B\nWhen Nate was awake in the first novel, he was also very precisely prescient ( due to his telepathic connection with Tiamat ). Nate used to be a child who was forced to live inside the town of Oak Ridge ( this town belonged to Mr. Gray's pseudo-christian religious cult called \"The Church of True Dawn of our lord Jesus Christ\" or just \"the Dawn\" ). Ethan escaped this cult in 1995. and Nate essentially escaped a year later. Ethan and Nate discovered that the cult is a part of an evil organization controlled by Mr. Gray. \n\nNate was able to use his prescience to strike a few blows against this cult and Mr. Gray, but as Raziel became operational ( and growingly more powerful ), Nate was only able to cancel-out Raziel's plans - but Raziel was also able to cancel-out Nate's plans, due to them both being prescient and in a conflict.\nThe dynamic between Nate, Raziel, and Mr. Gray adds a fascinating aspect to your story. Here are some suggestions for how to incorporate their complex relationship and their abilities in your novel:\n\nIn the second novel, as Nate is physically and mentally connected to Tiamat, you could explore how his prescient abilities have changed or developed over time. This could create new challenges for Lena and her companions as they try to navigate the consequences of Nate's actions from the past and the present.\n\nThe rivalry between Nate and Raziel can be a significant plot point in the story. As both are prescient and have been countering each other's moves, you could create a tense game of cat-and-mouse between the two. Lena and her allies may need to find a way to exploit this rivalry to their advantage or figure out how to break the stalemate between Nate and Raziel.\n\nYou could delve into the history of Nate and Ethan's time in Oak Ridge and their escape from the cult. This backstory can provide valuable context for the characters' motivations and relationships with Mr. Gray and the Dawn. It could also serve as a source of unresolved conflicts or tensions that resurface throughout the novel.\n\nAs Mr. Gray is aware of both Nate's and Raziel's abilities, he might attempt to manipulate them to his own advantage, playing them against each other or trying to control their actions. This could lead to unexpected twists and betrayals as the characters try to outmaneuver one another.\n\nThe prescient abilities of Nate and Raziel could also create opportunities for interesting narrative structures and storytelling techniques. For example, you could have chapters or scenes that take place in the past, present, or future, showing the consequences of their actions and how they impact the world around them. This nonlinear storytelling can keep readers engaged and guessing about what will happen next.\n\nBy developing the complex relationships and abilities of Nate, Raziel, and Mr. Gray, you can create a rich and engaging narrative that will captivate readers and leave them eager for more. Their intertwined histories and the ongoing battle between prescient characters add depth and tension to the story, making for a thrilling read.\n\n\nPetar B\n1. In the last few chapters of the previous novel, Nate is wounded and laid on Tiamat's side, so he is unable to communicate with the outside world. Tiamat is also unable to communicate with anyone else except Nate, so they exist and influence the world in this novel, but they are kind of separate from the rest of the world and the other characters. \n\n2. The rivalry between Raziel and Nate was a plot point in the previous novel, now Raziel is slowly losing his mind because of the radiation, and he's dissatisfied because he must serve the Hybrids. Raziel sees Mr. Gray as his primary master, but he is programmed to be loyal to the hybrids.\n\n3. this is all covered in the first novel. Some might appear as some memories, but whoever wants to know more, can just grab the first novel and read it.\n\n4. Mr. Gray isn't fully aware of Nate's powers, and neither is Raziel. They sense that Nate has something to do with problems in their previous plans, and they sense that Nate might have had something to do with Mr. Gray's downfall from power, but they are not sure, and neither is Lena.\n\nThank you for the clarification. Given these points, here are some suggestions for your second novel:\n\nThroughout the second novel, you can provide glimpses of Nate and Tiamat's conversations or experiences while they remain separate from the rest of the world. This can add an air of mystery and intrigue, as readers try to understand the true nature of their connection and how it may influence the events unfolding in the story.\n\nAs Raziel is slowly losing his mind due to radiation and is dissatisfied with serving the Hybrids, you could explore his internal struggle and how it impacts his decisions. This could lead to interesting plot twists and revelations, as Raziel's loyalties are tested, and he may take unexpected actions.\n\nLena and her allies may gradually uncover more information about Nate's powers and the influence he had on the events in the first novel. This process of discovery can serve as a driving force behind Lena's journey and motivate her actions throughout the story.\n\nMr. Gray's lack of full awareness of Nate's powers can create an interesting dynamic, as he tries to regain his power and influence. He might attempt to manipulate the Hybrids, Lena, and other characters to achieve his goals, all while trying to piece together the true nature of Nate's abilities and their connection to Tiamat.\n\nBy incorporating these elements into your second novel, you can create a story full of mystery, intrigue, and character-driven conflict. The uncertainty surrounding Nate's powers and the impact they have on the world around him can serve as a catalyst for the events in the novel and keep readers engaged and eager to find out what happens next."}, {"Prompt Length": 1951, "Output Length": 177, "prompt": "Please summarize the sentence below in detail.\n\n00:00\nFor more than two decades, I've had the privilege to work on our core productivity apps, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.

With a few simple prompts, Copilot understands everything it needs to know to generate a great first draft of the invitation. It's even able to pull in details about the venue from an email I received last week.\n01:14\nNow I have a draft invite that includes the basic information. I can edit this, I can ask my guests to share funny stories and give them a link where they can upload photos. Now, I think this first draft is a little wordy, so let's make it more concise. With that done, this is my opportunity to create a loving and, let's be honest, a little embarrassing slideshow to celebrate the occasion.\n01:43\nI kick things off with Copilot, providing a little information to get started. I add some details about my daughter. I can also change the style so we create something fun and festive and Copilot goes to work finding the right words and searching my OneDrive for the best photos. In seconds, Copilot generates a beautiful presentation with memories, accomplishments, and advice for the future.\n02:15\nI can add my own personal touches to it and Copilot will be at my side. Now let's look at this slide. I'm really happy with the design, but Copilot didn't quite have what it needed, so I'm going to rework the text. I can then ask Copilot to make it more concise and add images. Okay, now that looks great.\n02:35\nOn this next slide, there's a part that Copilot didn't quite get right, so I'll rewrite it so that it sounds a little bit more like me. I also want to use a different image here, so I'll just tell Copilot what I want, and Copilot will find it. I can add transitions between the slides, which I always forget, so that when I play the presentation, it looks really polished.\n03:00\nOkay, I like how that turned out. Now, I don't know about you, but PowerPoint animations have never been my strong suit. I love that I can do this on my own. The average person uses less than 10% of what PowerPoint can do. Copilot unlocks the other 90%. Now on to party planning. I'll start with a few details about the event and once again, Copilot goes to work.\n03:31\nWith a simple prompt it creates pages for everything I need to think about to plan this party. Let\u2019s say I want to put this plan in a simple to do list. Boom. Done. I'm thinking about what I want to say to my daughter on her big day. Copilot can get me started on a speech. I'm not sure how long I want it to be, but let's start with 3 minutes.\n04:00\nI know I want to tell her how proud I am, acknowledge how hard she's worked, how inspired I am by her volunteer efforts, and what a wonderful leader she is. Here's a great first draft. Now, here's an important thing about Copilot. At this point, I decide whether to keep this draft, modify it, or discard it completely.\n04:25\nThis is a big change in how people interact with software. Okay, so this looks pretty good. But let's add some of the funny stories I collected from friends and family. Let's give it a minute. I can make these stories more playful and add more, but I actually want to make them a bit shorter. Let's get to the punchline, right? There, much better.\n04:52\nNow, this looks pretty good, but I really want to add my own personal touch, so I am going to edit it. You can see that throughout the writing process, I am always in control. Now I want to quickly format it to make sure I nail the delivery and Copilot automatically adjusts the spacing, making it easier for me to read and adds speaker cues to help me improve my delivery.\n05:18\nLet's shift gears into business mode. You saw how Copilot saves me time as a working mom, but the real power of Copilot is in how it unleashes creativity at work. Imagine you're leading a team at a global manufacturing company and you want to create a rock solid customer proposal and you don't have time for writer's block.\n05:44\nLet's see how Copilot can use your customer notes in OneNote, as well as another internal document. Copilot quickly creates a first draft. Now, you probably want this to look like your previous proposals. Copilot can give you a draft in the format you typically use. It inserts product images and pulls in relevant visuals from other files.\n06:13\nYou can even include a short summary at the top of the document and Copilot can make suggestions to strengthen the proposal, like adding an FAQ, which it will generate for you. Now remember, you're not going to send this off to a customer without a thorough review. But Copilot still saved you tons of time in the process.\n06:40\nIt's time to get ready for your customer pitch meeting. Now, everyone has had a moment when they wish they could turn their proposal into a customer ready presentation without having to start from scratch. Well, guess what? Now you can. Copilot can turn your Word document into a PowerPoint presentation.\n07:04\nNow you have a professional looking presentation that you can hone and polish. This is truly amazing. Using just your words, Copilot translates Word into PowerPoint and PowerPoint into Word. Now let's add a slide and give Copilot some quick instructions. There it goes. Ready for you to review. Now, this slide is a little bit wordy.\n07:32\nLet's ask Copilot to make it more visual. And check this out. Copilot can even animate the slide. It gives it a professional design treatment in a single click, but it doesn't stop there. Copilot can even generate speaker notes. I am serious. Speaker notes. It's not only a time saver, it's helping me be a better presenter and close this deal.\n08:01\nLet's jump into Copilot in Excel. Copilot puts all the rich capabilities of Excel at your fingertips. Say you need to analyze this quarter's sales results. You start by asking Copilot to analyze the data and give you three key trends. Within seconds, you've got what you need, but you want to drill in.\n08:25\nYou ask Copilot a follow up question about one of the trends. Copilot creates a new sheet. This new sheet creates a sandbox to play in to better understand what's going on without modifying the data in the original sheet. This is a great example of how Copilot up levels your skills, showing you how to break down the problem step-by-step.\n08:52\nYou ask Copilot to visualize what contributed to the decline in sales growth this period. Copilot adds a little color to make the problem jump off the page. Now you want to dig deeper and ask a follow up question. Copilot not only answers your question, it creates a simple model of the scenario and it even asks you if you want to learn more about what it did with a step-by-step breakdown.\n09:24\nFinally, you can ask it to create a graph of your projected model. Copilot turned a sea of data into clear insights and actions. Let me show you how Copilot can help you tackle your email. We all struggle with the pull of the inbox. Sometimes it keeps us from focusing on our most important work. But at the same time, you do have important emails to respond to.\n09:52\nCopilot separates the signal from the noise and gives you hours of time back. Copilot can help you triage your inbox, highlighting the most important emails to prioritize. And Copilot also helps you on the go in Outlook mobile. It can summarize long email threads, you can draft a reply using data from an Excel file and Copilot will generate a reply for you.\n10:23\nYou can edit it, you can make it more concise, you can even change the writing style or add more context. Now all that's left to do is review the proposed response and hit send. Copilot is a productivity game changer.Share Prompt"}, {"Prompt Length": 1241, "Output Length": 177, "prompt": "Understand context and reply Yes \"\"\" Linking and Navigating\nThe Next.js router uses server-centric routing with client-side navigation. It supports instant loading states and concurrent rendering. This means navigation maintains client-side state, avoids expensive re-renders, is interruptible, and doesn't cause race conditions.\n\nThere are two ways to navigate between routes:\n\n Component\nuseRouter Hook\nThis page will go through how to use , useRouter(), and dive deeper into how navigation works.\n\n Component\n is a React component that extends the HTML element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n\nUsage\nTo use , import it from next/link, and pass a href prop to the component:\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n return Dashboard;\n}\nThere are optional props you can pass to . See the API reference for more information.\n\nExample: Linking to Dynamic Segments\nWhen linking to dynamic segments, you can use template literals and interpolation to generate a list of links. For example, to generate a list of blog posts:\n\napp/blog/PostList.jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nexport default function PostList({ posts }) {\n return (\n \n {posts.map((post) => (\n * {post.title}\n\n ))}\n \n\n );\n}\nuseRouter() Hook\nThe useRouter hook allows you to programmatically change routes inside Client Components.\n\nTo use useRouter, import it from next/navigation, and call the hook inside your Client Component:\n\n'use client';\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n const router = useRouter();\n\n return (\n router.push('/dashboard')}>\n Dashboard\n \n );\n}\nThe useRouter provides methods such as push(), refresh(), and more. See the API reference for more information.\n\nRecommendation: Use the component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using useRouter.\n\nHow Navigation Works\nA route transition is initiated using or calling router.push().\nThe router updates the URL in the browser\u2019s address bar.\nThe router avoids unnecessary work by re-using segments that haven't changed (e.g. shared layouts) from the client-side cache. This is also referred to as partial rendering.\nIf the conditions of soft navigation are met, the router fetches the new segment from the cache rather than the server. If not, the router performs a hard navigation and fetches the Server Component payload from the server.\nIf created, loading UI is shown from the server while the payload is being fetched.\nThe router uses the cached or fresh payload to render the new segments on the client.\nClient-side Caching of Rendered Server Components\nGood to know: This client-side cache is different from the server-side Next.js HTTP cache.\n\nThe new router has an in-memory client-side cache that stores the rendered result of Server Components (payload). The cache is split by route segments which allows invalidation at any level and ensures consistency across concurrent renders.\n\nAs users navigate around the app, the router will store the payload of previously fetched segments and prefetched segments in the cache.\n\nThis means, for certain cases, the router can re-use the cache instead of making a new request to the server. This improves performance by avoiding re-fetching data and re-rendering components unnecessarily.\n\nInvalidating the Cache\nThe cache can be invalidated using router.refresh(). For more information, see the API reference. In the future, mutations will automatically invalidate the cache.\n\nPrefetching\nPrefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before it's visited. The rendered result of prefetched routes is added to the router's client-side cache. This makes navigating to a prefetched route near-instant.\n\nBy default, routes are prefetched as they become visible in the viewport when using the component. This can happen when the page first loads or through scrolling. Routes can also be programmatically prefetched using the prefetch method of the useRouter() hook.\n\nStatic and Dynamic Routes:\n\nIf the route is static, all the Server Component payloads for the route segments will be prefetched.\nIf the route is dynamic, the payload from the first shared layout down until the first loading.js file is prefetched. This reduces the cost of prefetching the whole route dynamically and allows instant loading states for dynamic routes.\nGood to know:\n\nPrefetching is only enabled in production.\nPrefetching can be disabled by passing prefetch={false} to .\nHard Navigation\nOn navigation, the cache is invalidated and the server refetches data and re-renders the changed segments.\n\nSoft Navigation\nOn navigation, the cache for changed segments is reused (if it exists), and no new requests are made to the server for data.\n\nConditions for Soft Navigation\nOn navigation, Next.js will use soft navigation if the route you are navigating to has been prefetched, and either doesn't include dynamic segments or has the same dynamic parameters as the current route.\n\nFor example, consider the following route that includes a dynamic [team] segment: /dashboard/[team]/\\*. The cached segments below /dashboard/[team]/\\* will only be invalidated when the [team] parameter changes.\n\nNavigating from /dashboard/team-red/\\* to /dashboard/team-red/\\* will be a soft navigation.\nNavigating from /dashboard/team-red/\\* to /dashboard/team-blue/\\* will be a hard navigation.\nBack/Forward Navigation\nBack and forward navigation (popstate event) has a soft navigation behavior. This means, the client-side cache is re-used and navigation is near-instant.\n\nFocus and Scroll Management\nBy default, Next.js will set focus and scroll into view the segment that's changed on navigation. The importance of this accessibility and usability feature will be more apparent when advanced routing patterns are implemented.\n\nGood to know: Next.js used to wrap each segment in a div element to achieve this behavior. This is now fixed as on the latest Next.js canary. Update to next@canary to get the latest fixes.\n\nNext Steps\n`next/link` API Reference\nPerform client-side route transitions.\n`useRouter` API Reference\nProgrammatically navigate to a new route. \"\"\""}]}
